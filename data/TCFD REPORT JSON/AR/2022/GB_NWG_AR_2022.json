We saw continued growth in our lending and progress against our strategy. The bank's share price rose by 17.5% over the year, outperforming our major UK competitors, while during 2022 the UK Government's shareholding fell from 53% to 46%.\n\nClearly, the outlook for 2023 remains challenging, with declines in economic activity expected and a further tightening of consumer spending and real incomes. Indications of weakening housing market activity are also emerging. The UK labour market, however, remains strong, with the unemployment rate at 3.7% (1) .\n\nAs a bank with 19 million customers in the UK - and an employer of around 60,000 people worldwide - we know that many are worried about this economic outlook and its impact on their own financial situation. In the Stakeholder focus area of this report (pages 42-43) we explain the work we have been doing to help our customers, especially those in vulnerable situations, to navigate through this difficult period.\n\nNatWest Group has a high-quality, well-diversified loan book where we are not yet seeing any material signs of deterioration, and credit losses remain low. However, we continue to monitor customer activity and behaviours closely for signs of stress, taking action where appropriate.\n\n(1)  UK labour market overview in January 2023.\n\nOur strong financial performance, continued capital generation and robust balance sheet mean that we are able to stand alongside customers, colleagues and communities; providing practical, proactive support as they face into this challenging economic environment.\n\nThe bank's financial strength, and that of our business segments, allowed us to grow our lending throughout 2022, while investing to create a simpler and better banking experience for our customers.\n\nLooking back at the three years since we set out our purposeled strategy, there is a strong track record of success. The Board is fully supportive of our strategy: building on the progress we have made; diversifying our business in order to generate sustainable growth and returns through the economic cycle.\n\nIn total, we paid and proposed \u00a35.1 billion of capital returns to shareholders in 2022. As well as paying a \u00a3364 million interim dividend and a \u00a31.0 billion final dividend, we paid a special dividend of \u00a31.75 billion along with a share consolidation.\n\nWe were also pleased to complete our second directed buyback of \u00a31.2 billion of UK Government shares in March 2022 and we maintain capacity to do more in future. In addition, we completed our second \u00a3750 million on-market buyback announced in February 2022 and we will consider further buybacks of that kind.\n\nThe drop in the UK Government's shareholding to below 50% for the first time since the financial crisis was a significant moment. While it had no material effect on the way the bank operates, it was an important milestone, underlining the progress we have made.\n\nNatWest Group's strong financial performance has been reflected in the bonus pool for 2022, which has increased from the previous year as our profits rose, while we continue to demonstrate restraint given the market conditions. We kept pay under review through 2022 as the increasing cost of living impacted our people. We focused support on those colleagues working in lower-paid roles, with a permanent pay rise in September 2022 and a one-off cost of living payment announced in December 2022.\n\nWe also agreed a 2023 pay package which was supported by our employee representatives and their members, and which recognises the impact inflation is having on spending power, with many colleagues receiving a pay rise of at least \u00a32,000.\n\nThere was also strong support at our annual general meeting (AGM) in April 2022 for the Board's recommended changes to normalise executive pay policy and to bring it in line with other UK banks.\n\nThe changes will result over time in a more competitive policy for our most senior leaders, recognising the strong progress that has been made against our strategy in recent years. Around two-thirds of pay will continue to be delivered in shares, aligning it to the long-term interests of the bank and its investors.\n\nBoard succession planning was a key area of focus in 2022, as two of our long-standing directors approached the end of their tenure on the Board.\n\nIn December 2022 we said farewell to Robert Gillespie, who resigned as a non-executive director after nine years. To allow for an orderly handover of responsibilities, Robert stepped down as Chair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee in September 2022 and was succeeded by Lena Wilson.\n\nRobert expertly chaired the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee from 2018 until 2022, successfully navigating a period of continued change for the bank. I would like to thank him for his tremendous contribution over the years. We have benefited greatly from his wisdom and experience.\n\nIn October 2022, we were pleased to welcome Roisin Donnelly to the Board as an independent non-executive director. Roisin has an impressive executive track record in customer experience, data and digital transformation, together with significant board experience, and brings valuable perspectives to Board discussions.\n\nAnd in December 2022, we announced that Stuart Lewis will join the Board as a non-executive director in April 2023. Subject to regulatory approval, Stuart will be appointed as Chair of the Group Board Risk Committee on 1 August 2023. He will replace Morten Friis, who has confirmed his intention to step down as a non-executive director in July 2023.\n\nMike Rogers has also confirmed he will be stepping down as a non-executive director in April 2023, in order to take up the role of Chairman of Admiral Group plc. I would like to record my thanks to both Morten and Mike for their commitment, diligence and immense contributions as non-executive directors.\n\nDuring a period of significant change in the external environment, the Board was kept regularly informed by management on the impacts of geopolitical and economic developments on the bank and its customers.\n\nStrategy and climate were also high on the Board's agenda. Following strong shareholder support at our AGM for our 'Say on Climate' resolution, the Board continued its close oversight of progress towards our climate ambitions ahead of the publication of the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\n\nAs they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, Alison and her leadership team have used the bank's purpose to support our commercial and retail customers while growing the business and delivering against the strategic priorities.\n\nThe Board is pleased with the progress that has been made over the last three years and supports the priorities that Alison and her capable team have set out.\n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alison on being appointed a Dame in the New Year Honours List in December 2022, which recognised her contribution to the financial services sector.\n\nWhile we are operating in an uncertain landscape, I am confident that NatWest Group's strategy will continue to ensure that we can support all of our stakeholders through the challenges and opportunities in the years to come.\n\n## Howard Davies\n\nChairman",

By standing strong and standing together, we can provide the support and security our customers, colleagues, economy and society need.'\n\nAlison Rose DBE Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## for a digital world A relationship bank\n\nIn 2022, as the country recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed economic conditions not seen in generations. The highest inflation rate in decades, rising interest rates, a steep increase in energy costs and supply chain disruption had a huge impact on people's lives. This meant that being guided by our purpose to support our stakeholders and drive long-term sustainable value was as important as ever.\n\nIn light of these challenging economic circumstances, we focused on putting in place proactive support to help people, families and businesses to manage, and to help alleviate the financial pressures being felt by those who were most vulnerable. The strength of our balance sheet has allowed us to stand alongside our customers and help them to navigate this heightened uncertainty, as well as delivering a strong financial performance for NatWest Group and value for shareholders.\n\n## Support for the cost of living\n\nWe responded quickly and meaningfully, proactively contacting our customers to offer support and information on the cost of living. In addition, we carried out c.0.7 million financial health checks in 2022 and launched our credit score feature in our mobile app to help customers understand their credit score. Our online cost of living hub was also established to share resources and tools, informing customers of the support that is available to them, as well as support through third parties. These measures were in addition to \u00a34 million in donations to provide grants and support, delivered in collaboration with organisations including Citizens Advice, The Trussell Trust, Step Change and PayPlan.\n\nAs one of the leading banking partners of UK business, we have taken a range of actions on charges, waiving fees on some products where appropriate, including freezing standard published tariffs on Business Current Accounts for 12 months to help SMEs, and offering free card machine hire for new customers on our payment service Tyl.\n\nFor our commercial customers, we were able to deliver tailored support to the most impacted sectors, including a \u00a31.25 billion lending package for our c.40,000 agriculture customers, as well as providing c.51,700 financial health checks for our business customers.\n\nSupporting our colleagues during this period has continued to be a key focus. In addition to the pay review in April 2022, and following consultation with our recognised employee representatives in September 2022, we put in place targeted action to provide long-term support for colleagues through a permanent increase in base pay for our lowest-paid colleagues, globally. This brought total investments in pay of around \u00a3115 million per annum in 2022, an increase of 85% on 2021.\n\nWe agreed further measures for 2023 which include a one-off \u00a31,000 cost of living cash payment for c.42,000 colleagues in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Channel Islands, and c.60,000 people globally. The 2023 pay proposal also includes a minimum increase of \u00a32,000 for almost all of the colleagues covered by it. Taken together, this will mean that c.80% of lower-paid colleagues covered by our negotiated pay approach will receive an increase, plus a cash payment, equivalent to 10% or more of their fixed pay. In the UK, our rates of pay continue to exceed the 'Living Wage Foundation' benchmarks and, for our major hubs outside the UK, we continue to pay above the minimum and living wage rates in the Republic of Ireland as well as exceeding the minimum wage benchmarks in India and Poland.\n\n## Delivering on our strategy\n\nOf course, these actions - driven by our purpose - are not just the right thing to do, but they are key to building a long-term, profitable organisation and are underpinned by the strong foundations of our strategy. Our operating profit for 2022 of \u00a35.1 billion increased from \u00a33.8 billion the year before. Pleasingly, this was driven by strong performance across all business segments and enabled from a position of responsible and sustainable lending. We also continued to make progress against our financial targets. Other operating expenses, for the Go-forward group (1) , were \u00a3201 million, or 2.9% lower than 2021, in line with our cost reduction target of around 3% (2) , and we retain a CET1 ratio of 14.2%, in line with our target.\n\nAgainst an uncertain economic outlook, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our loan and deposit base allow us to continue lending responsibly while also helping our customers to navigate the challenges they are facing. Net lending balances increased by \u00a37.3 billion, 2.0%, with growth balanced across the bank. Mortgage growth continued and wholesale lending was strong across the whole book. Customer deposits did decrease by \u00a329.5 billion, or 6.1%. However, this principally reflected a reduction in our Commercial & Institutional segment, and a \u00a312.2 billion reduction due to our withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThis strong capital position and continued capital generation means that we are well placed to invest for growth, to provide the support our customers need as the economy recovers and to drive sustainable returns to shareholders, with \u00a35.1 billion shareholder distributions paid and proposed for 2022 through dividends and buybacks. Against this backdrop, we also returned to majority private ownership during 2022 with the UK Government's stake falling below 50%, which was a symbolic milestone for our bank.\n\nIt is from this basis of progress and profitability that we are amplifying our strategy, accelerating what we're doing but also being mindful of new opportunities and challenges we and our customers face. We aim to create ever closer and deeper relationships with our customers at every stage of their lives support that starts earlier, reflects their values and meets their changing needs. It is a simple principle: if our customers thrive, so will we.\n\nAnd our purpose, to champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive, which has guided us through the last few years, is here to stay. Through our three areas of focus - climate, enterprise, and learning - we believe we can make a meaningful contribution to our customers and society and create long-term value for all our stakeholders. This allows us to build on our track record of delivery, to move forward with confidence and pace and to compete effectively in a rapidly changing external market. The result will be a more sustainable business with more diverse income streams, able to support our customers and generate sustainable growth.\n\nNew and emerging social, commercial and economic trends are shaping our customers' financial lives and there are important opportunities to transform our relevance and value to customers, building on their trust. We will do this by delivering personalised solutions throughout customers' lifecycles; embedding our services in our customers' digital lives; and supporting customers' sustainability transitions.\n\n## Our values in action\n\nOur values are at the heart of how we deliver our purpose-led strategy. In 2021, we engaged with colleagues, customers and communities to re-envision a modernised set of values that fully align with our strategic priorities. These collaborative and evolved values of being inclusive, curious, robust, sustainable and ambitious were launched in 2022 and now form an integral part of our identity (read more in our Stakeholder focus area on page 47).\n\nIndeed, these values are evident in the contributions we have been making to communities and wider society during 2022. With the tragic events from Russia's invasion of Ukraine dominating our thoughts for most of the year, it has been incredibly humbling to witness the collective response for those affected. Donations from NatWest Group colleagues and customers to the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal exceeded \u00a310 million. In addition, NatWest Group pledged \u00a3100,000 to support 500 Ukrainian students to continue their studies at Polish universities and polytechnics. We also made Gogarburn House, in the grounds of our head office in Edinburgh, available to the Scottish Government and Edinburgh City Council as a welcome centre for people displaced from Ukraine and offered assistance to refugees wishing to open bank accounts. Meanwhile, our colleagues provided relief aid at the PolishUkrainian border and opened their homes to Ukrainian families.\n\nWe continue to invest in the future of not just our colleagues, but future generations. We have been delighted to collaborate with footballer and campaigner Marcus Rashford MBE and the National Youth Agency (NYA) to provide NatWest Thrive, a unique programme for young people to develop their self-belief as well as their money confidence. Early feedback from the pilot scheme was incredibly encouraging, delivering a 63% uplift in participants' confidence about their futures.\n\n- (1)  Go-forward group excludes Ulster Bank RoI and discontinued operations.",

        "page_content": "NatWest Thrive has since been rolled out to 15 clubs, reaching over 800 young people across the UK with plans to scale much further. NatWest Group will also transfer \u00a33 million of its apprenticeship levy to the NYA to support the training of 200 youth workers.\n\nLearning is a key focus area for the business. And whether this is through the ongoing successes of our MoneySense and CareerSense schemes helping young people with financial advice and employability, our Talent Academy, or our social mobility apprenticeship programmes, we have ensured that we continue to help break down the barriers for people to succeed and thrive.\n\nTo help build financial capability early on, we also launched NatWest Rooster Money. The pocket money product helps children develop money confidence and positive habits around saving and spending, nurturing financial resilience in the next generation. We have built a smooth connection to Rooster Money via the main mobile app and there have been c.89,000 Rooster Money card openings in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, in collaboration with Meta, we launched a package of support for female entrepreneurs through the #SheMeansBusiness programme, which selected 50 of the most promising female entrepreneurs from c.3,600 applicants to form a dedicated support community, with sessions delivered by our Enterprise Delivery Team over a six-month period. And to shine a light on women running thriving businesses in the face of current economic challenges, we were delighted to launch with The Telegraph , the '100 Female Entrepreneurs to Watch' list. Alongside Aston University, we also published the report 'Time to change: A blueprint for advancing the UK's ethnic minority businesses', which sets out recommendations for policymakers, companies and entrepreneurs to advance the growth potential of ethnic minority businesses.\n\nI was also immensely proud of the announcement of our new partner leave policy (1) , which supports all eligible colleagues with significantly more time away from work to help their partner look after their new child, whether the child has arrived through birth, adoption or surrogacy.\n\n## The net-zero opportunity\n\nThrough funding, refinancing and supporting people, families and businesses to transition to net zero, we want to help create a sustainable future for our customers, communities and our planet. It is why addressing the climate challenge - one of the biggest issues of our time - is a key strategic priority for the bank. It sits at the heart of our purpose, because we know that tackling climate change is the right thing to do both societally and commercially.\n\nWe have made significant progress in turning our climate ambition into action since setting out our climate strategy in 2020. As a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), and as a principal partner of COP26, in 2021 NatWest Group established itself as one of the leading voices for finance on tackling climate change.\n\nDuring 2022, I was delighted to see that our momentum continued. Our global approach was again in evidence at COP27, where we worked alongside the UK Government to support the UK Pavilion, co-hosting several high-profile events with customers and key stakeholders such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative. Closer to home, through our first climate resolution, the Board gave shareholders their 'Say on Climate', asking them to support our strategic direction on climate change at the AGM. 92.58% of votes cast were in favour of the resolution, indicating strong support for our climate strategy.\n\nNatWest Group has also become the first UK bank, and one of the largest banks globally, to have science-based targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets underpin the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan (published in our 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report), which outlines the steps we aim to take to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030, thereby contributing to the UK's net-zero strategy, and to reach net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, assets under management and operational value chain.\n\nBut we know that we can, and must, do more. We also want to provide the practical solutions to help our customers transition to net zero. By delivering initiatives such as our Greener Homes Retrofit pilot, launching our EPC rating tool in our digital mortgage hub and launching our new Carbon Planner for UK business, we are enabling our customers to identify potential cost and carbon savings.\n\nImportantly, I believe these actions are not only good for the planet, but good for business too. With the right support, the UK's SMEs could create up to 260,000 new jobs, produce around 40,000 new businesses and deliver an estimated \u00a3175 billion revenue opportunity for the UK economy by 2030 (2) . Of course, this is not something any individual organisation can do on its own. Support from policymakers as well as collaboration across the private sector will be vital for mobilising the finance necessary to fund the infrastructure of future green economies. Initiatives such as Carbonplace, where NatWest Group has joined forces with other financial institutions to create a global carbon credit transaction network, or the Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition, which NatWest Group launched with British Gas and Worcester Bosch to improve UK buildings' energy efficiency, are great examples of how this cross-industry collaboration can have meaningful real-world impact.\n\n- (1)  Our partner leave policies will replace existing paternity leave policies from 1 January 2023 across our operations in the UK, Offshore, Republic of Ireland, US, Poland and India.\n\nWe have now provided \u00a332.6 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing against our target to provide \u00a3100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025, which includes \u00a327.2 billion across Commercial & Institutional (C&I), as well as mortgage lending for EPC A and B homes totalling \u00a35.1 billion in Retail Banking and \u00a30.2 billion in Private Banking. And, delivered in collaboration with fintech firm Cogo, our carbon-tracking tool for retail customers had 334,500 unique users in 2022, a clear indication of the demand that our customers have for understanding the carbon footprint of their daily spending.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2022 has shown us the importance of being a purpose-led bank. But it has also shown us what it takes to be purpose-led. Against a volatile economic backdrop, we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business, delivering a strong financial performance while supporting our customers and putting in place proactive support to help those who are most vulnerable.\n\nTo continue to do this, we are evolving our capabilities. Underpinned by the strong foundations of our strategy, we are investing in our technology and colleagues so we can serve our customers in new ways that make their lives easier. Our focus now is on the opportunities those relationships offer for growth: for our customers, for our economy and, as a result, for the bank.\n\nSustainable growth will come from building closer relationships that better serve our customers at every stage of their lives. These relationships will be based on insight, understanding, and shared goals, powered by data-driven innovation. This will enable us to make a real difference to our customers' lives by providing the right advice, products and support to unlock potential. We will also strengthen our relationships by working with partners to ensure we deliver the services and products customers expect, when they want them, tailored to fit their lives.\n\nBy getting closer to our customers, by offering them an ever-better service, day in, day out, we create sustainable growth for the bank because those customers, over a lifetime, will recommend us to others and use us in more parts of their lives.\n\nWe've always known relationships matter, and now we are doing more than ever before to harness them. By providing the support and security our customers, colleagues, economy and society need, together we can help build a more sustainable future for people, families, businesses and the planet.\n\n## Alison Rose DBE\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The initial iteration of our Climate transition plan\n\nThe initial iteration of our Climate transition plan focuses on the delivery of our 2030 decarbonisation ambitions. This will form the basis for further work on our journey to net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, Assets under Management and our operational value chain. We have used available guidance, including GFANZ, Transition Planning Taskforce and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, to inform the development of our transition plan.\n\nA strategic tool, the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan will be developed and enhanced further as we move towards 2030 and beyond. Read more in our 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\nOur ambition to be a leading bank in the UK helping to address the climate challenge is a core part of our purpose-led strategy.

NatWest Markets plc's funding plan targets \u00a33 billion to \u00a35 billion of public benchmark issuance.\n\n## Medium term\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to target a sustainable return on tangible equity for the group of 14-16% over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 We expect to deliver a Group cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) of less than 50%, by 2025.\n- \u00b7 We expect that RWAs could increase by a further 5-10% by the end of 2025, including the impact of Basel 3.1.\n- \u00b7 We expect to continue to generate and return significant capital via ordinary dividends and buybacks to shareholders over the medium term and continue to expect that the CET1 ratio will be in the range of 13-14%.",

Our strategy for growth delivers on our purpose and drives sustainable returns to shareholders through four strategic priorities: we will support our customers at every stage of their lives; we will be powered by innovation and partnerships as we accelerate our digital transformation; we will be simple to deal with; and we will allocate our capital in a way that delivers for customers and shareholders.\n\n## Our positive impact\n\nWe recognise the huge responsibilities that our role brings - from supporting the day-to-day financial needs of 19 million customers to the positive impacts we can have on the environment and wider society.\n\nWe have identified three focus areas where we can make a meaningful contribution and build long-term value in our business: Climate, Enterprise and Learning.\n\nus to build long-term value, to invest for growth, to make a positive contribution to society and to drive sustainable returns for shareholders.\n\nOur robust balance sheet, strong capital position and capital generative businesses mean we are well placed to support our customers and invest for growth, as well as driving sustainable returns to shareholders and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Our values\n\nOur values are at the heart of how we deliver our purpose-led strategy.

We know we can play a key role in inspiring future generations to develop their skills, experience and business ideas, and ultimately to achieve their goals.\n\nA great example of this is our support for Birmingham-based social enterprise Miss Macaroon. Founded by Rosie Ginday MBE in 2011, the company combines a passion for producing premium-quality food and a desire to help young people gain the skills and confidence to change their lives.\n\nStarting life with a small kitchen space and just \u00a3500 in capital, Miss Macaroon has now produced over three million macaroons for global brands, royalty and a host of celebrities, as well as becoming one of the region's leading employability programmes.\n\nWe were first able to support Rosie through the NatWest Group Accelerator programme by providing one-to-one coaching, access to mentors and industry experts, and networking with a community of like-minded entrepreneurs, as well as hot-desking space at our commercial offices in Birmingham. Through the Accelerator, Rosie received support to expand her company and open multiple retail outlets across the Midlands.\n\nThe company has gone from strength to strength, expanding its operations from individual customer orders to catering for wholesale businesses. With the development of a unique colour-matching service, Miss Macaroon has also attracted major corporate clients such as John Lewis.\n\nImportantly, Miss Macaroon's commercial success has enabled its social purpose, helping to deliver the MacsMAD programme which provides young people who often have multiple and complex needs the opportunity to gain work experience, better their career prospects and positively change their lives.\n\nTo date, 134 young people have been supported through the programme.

        "page_content": "## Adapting to evolving market trends\n\nThe environment we operate in is constantly changing. Understanding the multiple influences on our business enables us to be prepared for change, to respond quickly and to create value for the long term.\n\n## Economy\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2022, the UK economy continued its recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions, with GDP approaching pre-pandemic levels. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other global factors led to very large increases in energy costs and other commodities during the year. The resulting high inflation prompted central banks to tighten monetary policy and markets to anticipate significant increases in interest rates, leading to asset market volatility. In the UK the government announced a significant easing of fiscal policy, with measures to protect households from some of the increase in energy prices, as well as support for businesses and a reversal of some planned tax rises. Other countries introduced similar measures through a variety of policies. Sterling fell against the US dollar and the euro. In the longer term, demographic change, climate change, high levels of debt and inequality could all have financial impacts for our customers.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe know the tough economic conditions many of our customers have faced throughout 2022. As such, we have remained focused on removing barriers to doing business and providing more opportunities for companies to grow, helping the economy to build back better through initiatives such as our Accelerator programme, our national and regional SME Taskforce boards and our Business Builder toolkit, as well as supporting young enterprise through our involvement with The Prince's Trust.\n\n## Customers\n\n## Overview\n\nExpectations of banks have shifted markedly in recent years. Customers are wanting banks to deliver a better service: one that is simpler, more relevant and more purposeful. How customers access our products and services has already changed with increasing numbers of customers reaching us online and through our mobile app. The ways people live, work and run businesses are also altering at pace, with the pandemic accelerating the trend towards more digital services, while also seeing a proliferation of 'side-hustle' businesses. As well as monitoring these longer-term trends we have also been extremely mindful of the impact of rising prices during 2022 and the potential financial distress that this could cause the customers, businesses and communities we serve.\n\n## Our response\n\nIn response to the continued increases in the cost of living across the UK, we have put in place a range of targeted measures to support those who are likely to need it most, including proactive contacts to our customers to offer support and information. In addition, we carried out c.0.7 million financial health checks in 2022 and launched our credit score feature in our mobile app to help customers understand their credit score. Our online cost of living hub was also established to share resources and tools, informing customers of the support that is available to them, as well as support through third parties. These measures were in addition to \u00a34 million in donations to provide grants and support, delivered in collaboration with organisations including Citizens Advice, The Trussell Trust, Step Change and PayPlan. Meanwhile, as we look ahead to the next phase of our strategy, our future growth will be based on building new forms of relevance and trust with our customers, as well as supporting them through the challenges of today. We have identified three areas for sustainable future growth where we are well placed to do this: delivering personalised solutions throughout our customers' lifecycles; embedding our services in our customers' digital lives; and supporting our customers' sustainability transitions.\n\n## Technology\n\n## Overview\n\nNew business models and customer behaviours continue to evolve rapidly through advancing technology alongside large-scale societal changes. In the post-pandemic era, we recognise the growing role of technology in everything from digital work environments to the access and delivery of goods and services, including those within the financial sector.\n\nWe have remained focused on removing barriers to doing business and providing more opportunities for companies to grow.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe are leveraging technology to deliver value through the lifecycles of our customers. By helping them more and in technologically-embedded ways, our relationships should become closer and deeper, as well as more valuable. We continue to develop new services, based on an understanding of customers' lives, that more closely fit with what our customers want. Whether this is through new commercial offers that help run invoice management and cash flow analysis, integrated payments solutions or AI-based customer service, each of these innovations is designed to benefit customers, society and the economy, as well as being a driver of long-term sustainable value.\n\n## Cyber threats\n\n## Overview\n\nCyberattacks pose a constant risk to our operations, both in relation to our own digital estate and indirectly with regard to our supply chain. Cybercrime continues to evolve rapidly. Attacks may be from individuals or highly organised criminal groups intent on stealing money or sensitive data, or potentially holding organisations to ransom.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources in the development and evolution of cybersecurity controls, to deploy rigorous due diligence with regard to third parties and to work to protect and educate our colleagues and customers on fraud and scam activity. To provide continuity of service for customers with minimal disruption, we monitor and assess a diverse and evolving array of threats, both external and internal, as well as developing, strengthening or adapting existing control capability to be able to absorb and adapt to such disruptions.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Overview\n\nClimate change represents an inherent risk to NatWest Group, not only from its impact on the global economy, our customers, suppliers and counterparties, but also through its potential effects on asset values, operational costs and business models as the essential transition to a net-zero economy accelerates. These risks are subject to increasing regulatory, legislative, political and societal change. Conversely, the requirement to reduce carbon emissions also means NatWest Group has a significant role to play in areas such as the provision of climate and sustainable funding and financing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our response\n\nAs part of the implementation of its climate ambitions, at NatWest Group's AGM in April 2022, ordinary shareholders passed an advisory 'Say on Climate' resolution. Through the bank's first climate resolution, the Board asked shareholders to support our strategic direction on climate change, our intention to develop a Climate transition plan and for annual progress reports to be published. 92.58% of votes cast were in favour of the resolution, indicating strong support for our climate strategy. We also became the first UK bank, and one of the largest banks globally to date, to have science-based targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets, which cover 79% of our lending activities by exposure as at 31 December 2019, underpin the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan, which is incorporated within our 2022 Climaterelated Disclosures Report. We provided \u00a324.5 billion (*) climate and sustainable funding and financing in 2022, bringing the cumulative contribution towards our target to provide \u00a3100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025, to \u00a332.6 billion. As at the end of 2022, we had reduced our direct own operations emissions by 46%, against a 2019 baseline, with a plan to achieve a 50% reduction by 2025. Achievement of our climate ambitions is dependent on timely UK Government policy and technology developments, as well as on our customers and society to respond. At the same time, as a purpose-led organisation, we aim to engage and support our customers' transition to a net-zero economy. Read more in the 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## Overview\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated market which continues to evolve in scope. Areas of current regulatory focus include: delivering good customer outcomes, in particular the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) new requirements for a Consumer Duty, which expands its rules and principles to force firms to provide better consumer protection; operational resilience, in light of the UK authorities' policy requirements; climate change, and the development of the regulatory framework for sustainable finance; fraud and financial crime, with a focus on protecting customers from ever more sophisticated scams; capital and liquidity management, including the UK's approach to the implementation of Basel III; the UK's future regulatory framework, following its exit from the European Union and the opportunities that this provides; digital currencies, with the development of both public (central bank digital currencies) and private (e.g. stablecoins) offerings which have the potential to materially change the digital payments landscape; improving diversity, equity and inclusion in financial services through policy developments focused on improved data collection and reporting, and use of targets for representation.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe constantly monitor regulatory change and work with our regulators to help shape those developments that materially impact the bank, lobbying when necessary either bilaterally or in partnership with one of our affiliated industry bodies. We implement new regulatory requirements where applicable and use our frequent engagement meetings with regulators to discuss key regulatory priorities.",

From budgeting and saving, to supporting our customers to make more sustainable choices, our mobile app combined with exceptional colleagues are helping us to deliver our goal to become a relationship bank in a digital world. We want to deepen relationships with our customers by supporting them at key moments in their lives, improving their financial health and resilience and supporting younger generations to plan for the future.

We have conducted c.0.7 million financial health checks in 2022, 76,000 more than in 2021, and have proactively spoken to 1.45 million customers to provide additional support through regular customer care campaigns. Our 'Know My Credit Score' tool and budgeting help in our mobile app assists our customers to act promptly and understand their credit options. We have created an online cost of living hub which shares resources and support provided by us and third parties, and which has attracted 346,000 visits. Our \u00a34 million of donations provides support through collaboration with organisations including Citizens Advice, The Trussell Trust, Step Change and PayPlan.\n\nOur ambition is to provide the best digital experience with access to the best people. We remain focused on improving the digital experience of our customers, with 88% of their needs currently met digitally. We've reached our highest ever levels for customer satisfaction, which reflects the increasing number of customers who use us as their main bank. Our AI virtual assistant, Cora, fully supported 48.4% of customer queries without handing over to a human and we've made it easier to book an appointment in our branches or through our video channel with over 330,000 video appointments held in 2022.\n\nOur digital platforms help to make banking safe and more convenient. Our digital account opening journey has significantly reduced the associated cost of fraud and improved the experience for our customers with record satisfaction levels. We've made payments simpler and safer with a new payment hub in our app, while biometrics now enable 46% of payments. Our 'Card reveal' feature makes it easy to access card details and complete online purchases and 'PIN reveal' allows our customers to view their PIN on their app, with over one million pin reveals displayed in the mobile app, supporting our customers with their sustainability transitions by significantly reducing the number of PIN reminder slips sent.\n\nWe know how important it can be to save for unexpected bills, so we have supported c.0.5 million customers to start saving in 2022. We have increased the interest rate for our digital regular savers and Round Ups make it easy to save little and often with over 1.25 million customers signed up since it was launched last year, saving a total of \u00a3138 million. We're helping future generations to create good habits through Rooster Money and saw c.89,000 new card openings to build financial resilience\n\nacross the family. Saving towards the future can be difficult so it is important to help our customers make their money work harder and grow over the longer term. Our digital investing platforms, NatWest Invest and Royal Bank Invest, allow customers to invest from \u00a350 into a choice of five funds depending on their approach to risk and time horizon. 31,000 new investment accounts were opened on the platform in 2022.\n\nWe want to help our customers to use credit responsibly and have regularly reviewed our affordability checks to prevent customers from over-stretching. Our overdraft cost calculator has been used over 3.5 million times since its June launch and our soft search for credit cards gives customers the eligibility information they need without impacting their credit score. We launched a 30-month 0% balance transfer card which can help customers pay off outstanding debt, and our buy-now-pay-later offering gives our customers choice and control around how they manage their money with safeguards in place to help customers to use the facility responsibly.\n\nDespite volatility, we remained in the mortgage market throughout the period with our full product selection and continued to provide a consistent service to help our customers to purchase their homes, growing our UK market flow share to 13% with total mortgage balances of \u00a3187.2 billion. We\n\n## Building money confidence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Teaching positive financial habits with Rooster Money\n\nWe believe it's vital for young people to feel confident and capable with money.\n\nEnabling financial capability early in life is an essential tool for developing good money management in adulthood. And as young people adopt technology at an earlier age, the need to build these skills in a digital environment becomes even more important.\n\nThat's why, in 2021, we decided to acquire Rooster Money and integrate it into our wider youth proposition. The pocket-money app and pre-paid debit card enable parents to help their children to feel financially capable by teaching budgeting skills and encouraging saving to develop positive habits.\n\nThe contactless card gives children aged six and over more independence, while staying safe with spending notifications, limits and freezes managed within the app. Rooster Money's chore and star capabilities can also help children with their understanding of money from the age of three. As well as reaffirming our purpose-led ambition to attract and support the financial needs of more young people and their families, we also believe the Rooster Money proposition makes sound commercial sense.\n\nsupported 232,000 customers to move to a new deal and allowed customers to remortgage six months before the expiry of their existing mortgage, to help our customers to secure a rate earlier in a rising rate environment. Our over payment process has been simplified and our higher LTV products continue to provide customers with the flexibility they need in a challenging environment. Our investment in digitising the mortgage journey has resulted in 19,600 applications digitally and allowed us to launch a market first purchase decision in principle and remortgage journey with price comparison websites.\n\nHow we use our money today could change the world tomorrow and help to make a greener planet. We've had over 531,000 visits to our climate change hub and 333,000 customers have used our carbon tracker to understand and reduce their carbon footprint. To provide sustainable growth in the future, our aim is to encourage our customers to make more sustainable choices through lifestyle changes and home energy efficiencies. We supported our customers with \u00a32.2 billion in Green Mortgages, offering a lower rate for purchasing or re-mortgaging an energy efficient home. Our cards are now made from 86% recycled plastic, which is expected to save 23 tonnes of plastic and 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe number of 18-year-olds in the UK is set to grow 20% by 2030 (1) and there is increasing competition to provide this cohort with a digital pocket money proposition in their younger years. We believe we will be able to take a bigger share of the bankable (but currently unbanked) youth market by leveraging our strong customer base, offering a solution to parents for banking young people all the way through childhood.\n\nIn the short term, this will help us to engage customers in other youth products (for instance, growing Junior ISA volumes), increase the wider engagement of current parent customers and attract new families to us.\n\nIn the longer term, these young customers will graduate into primary adult customers, driving value for the bank for decades to come.\n\nRISK\n\nAND\n\nCAPITAL\n\nMANAGEMENT",

From 18 July 2022, the Coutts Managed Funds and discretionary portfolios include a commitment that a minimum of 20% of assets by value in each fund or portfolio will be on a net-zero trajectory. As of the end of the year, \u00a36.5 billion of AUM are invested in funds that are on a net-zero trajectory (1) and are decarbonising at an average rate of 7% per annum.\n\nBuilding on existing Coutts mortgage products that offer discounted arrangement fees for purchasing a more energy-efficient home (EPC rating of A or B) or for making improvements to improve energy efficiency (EPC rating C and above) Coutts launched a pilot for its Greener Homes Service. Providing bespoke advice to help participating customers overcome the barriers to retrofitting, the service includes a free energy performance assessment, details of retrofit costs and benefits, and the option to implement recommended measures through a pre-vetted supply chain. 30 customers are participating in the initial pilot of the Greener Homes Service, with further enhancement planned. In 2022, Coutts completed \u00a3241 million in mortgages for properties rated EPC A or B.\n\nBusiness exit is an incredibly important moment for any entrepreneur. Drawing on the knowledge and insights of entrepreneurs who have been through the process, we've created a free programme to share 20-plus years of our research. In March, we launched a series of video masterclasses from industry experts available to all entrepreneurs, regardless of whether they are a client. In 2022, we have taken 45 owners and Financial Directors, representing ownership of more than \u00a3572 million of shareholder value, through our Business Exit Programme.\n\nContinuing the collaboration with Business Growth Fund, we have now raised over \u00a380 million through the UK Enterprise Fund (UKEF).

Branch customers now have the option to speak to a Digital Wealth Manager who can give them guidance on how to use our Automated Advice service. This involved training over 1,730 branch staff across 650+ branches in the UK.

Valued at US$197 billion in 2022, the global gaming market is now on track to surpass US$225 billion by 2025. (2)\n\nThe Coutts Interactive Entertainment Accelerator programme was designed to help UK entrepreneurs scale their businesses in this growing sector and take them to the next level.\n\nDelivered in partnership with NatWest Accelerator, this bank-wide initiative allowed entrepreneurs to access and learn from business and industry experts.

Alongside our extensive outreach programme, our Business Current Accounts remained available without a minimum charge, while we froze the standard published tariffs and committed to no increases to published fees for 12 months. Moreover, through our deep sector expertise and service offering, we tailored support for the most impacted sectors, including a \u00a31.25 billion lending package for the farming industry, as part of a range of supportive measures for our c.40,000 agricultural customer base, which is facing extreme impacts on supply costs and profit margins - this is in addition to other support measures, such as capital repayment holidays and increased overdraft limits.\n\nEstablishing the new segment enables us to build even longer and deeper relationships with our customers, by providing support at each stage of their journey. As the biggest bank for businesses in the UK and a committed champion of startups, we are removing barriers to enterprise, tackling inequality and supporting growth by helping entrepreneurs achieve their ambitions. In 2022, we supported over 53,000 (*) individuals or businesses through enterprise programmes, with over 269,000 (*) interventions delivered.

In 2022, the Commercial & Institutional segment provided \u00a320.3 billion in climate and sustainable funding and financing. Our role as a cornerstone lender in the first greenfield solar transaction in the UK since 2018 demonstrates our commitment to leadership in renewables sector project financing. The syndicated loan will enable our customer to fund the construction of up to 1GW of solar capacity across the UK and the Netherlands, enough to power over 300,000 households, while creating local employment opportunities. To ensure as many SMEs as possible can realise the bottom-line benefits from their carbon-reduction efforts and innovation, we reduced the lower threshold for our Green Loans offering for SMEs from \u00a350,000 to \u00a325,001, so more businesses can access funding to transition to more sustainable practices.

In 2022, digitally-initiated commercial service requests more than doubled compared to the previous year. In addition, 83% of our customers are actively using digital channels to interact with us. Improvements in our digital lending journey now enable business customers to utilise our self-serve digital channels to apply for up to \u00a350,000 of borrowing and receive an automated decision within minutes.

However, demonstrating this link is a challenge which requires clear and sustained messaging and engagement.\n\nWe'll continue to develop our customer climate hub, to bring customers engaging and educational resources on energy efficiency and climate change, as well as our carbon footprint tracking tool in collaboration with Cogo, which allows customers to see a rolling monthly view of their carbon footprint.\n\nAt our 2022 AGM, the resolution to re-elect Frank Dangeard as a director was passed with lower support than expected following a recommendation to vote against by a proxy adviser under their methodology on overboarding. We acknowledged the situation in our post-AGM announcement and re-confirmed the Board's view that Mr Dangeard has sufficient time to devote to NatWest Group. The Chairman also engaged with institutional shareholders to discuss their concerns.\n\n## Key ESG topics for our stakeholders\n\nWe re-evaluate our key ESG topics annually and refresh where appropriate to ensure that our list continues to be comprehensive, relevant and reflective of our stakeholder groups' perspectives. For this year's assessment we've taken into consideration the evolving landscape and engaged with a number of internal and external stakeholders. The findings guide our reporting and decision-making, ensuring we remain focused on the right issues. This year's review once again confirmed that, as a responsible business, our approach to a broader range of ESG topics is of great significance to our stakeholders.\n\nRead more about our assessment and approach to materiality in relation to our ESG disclosures in our 2022 ESG Disclosures Report.\n\nFor further information on how stakeholder considerations influenced the Board's discussions and decision-making, refer to our section 172(1) statement on pages 40 and 41, and our Corporate governance report on page 94.",

For 2022, they remained customers, investors, regulators, colleagues, communities and suppliers.\n\nExamples of how the Board has engaged with key stakeholders, including the impact on principal decisions, can be found in this statement and on pages 36 to 39 (stakeholder engagement) and pages 90 to 137 (Corporate governance report).\n\n## Supporting effective Board discussions and decision-making\n\nOur purpose continues to influence Board discussions and decision-making.\n\nOur Board and Committee terms of reference reinforce the importance of considering both our purpose and the matters set out in section 172. Our Board and Committee paper template includes a section for authors to explain how the proposal or update aligns with our purpose and a separate section for them to include an assessment of the relevant stakeholder impacts for the directors to consider.\n\nOur directors are mindful that it is not always possible to achieve an outcome which meets the expectations of all stakeholders who may be impacted. For decisions which are particularly challenging or complex, an optional page in our paper template provides directors with further information to support purposeful decision-making. This additional page uses the Blueprint for Better Business framework as a base and is aligned to our broader purpose framework.\n\n## Principal decisions\n\nPrincipal decisions are those decisions taken by the Board that are material or of strategic importance to the company, or are significant to NatWest Group's key stakeholders.\n\n## This statement describes three examples of principal decisions taken by the Board during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Likely long-term consequences.                                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employee interests.                                               |\n| Relationships with customers, suppliers and others.               |\n| The impact on community and environment.                          |\n| Maintaining a reputation for high standards of  business conduct. |\n| Acting fairly between members of the company.                     |\n\n## Overseeing our future strategy\n\nFactors considered:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nThe Board considered NatWest Group's future strategy over three sessions in March, June and October 2022, reviewing and confirming its support for a plan to amplify our strategy.\n\nIn March 2022, the Board considered insights arising from a comprehensive programme of stakeholder listening. Directors joined breakout groups to discuss key themes, collaborating with the executive management team and Junior Management Team members. In June 2022, the Board agreed key areas of focus and a vision for our purpose-led strategy, including exploring the opportunities for sustainable growth. Then, in October 2022, the Board reviewed and confirmed its support for a strategic plan consistent with the ambition discussed in June 2022, including the identification of three growth areas where we can amplify our strategy. Throughout the process there was strong engagement and constructive debate among directors and management.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their section 172 duties and how were stakeholders considered?\n\nStakeholder impacts were considered throughout. The process began with stakeholder listening, engaging on the trends affecting our customers' financial lives, as individual households and institutions, and as networks and communities. Participating stakeholder groups included customer segments, shareholders, colleagues, suppliers and external third parties such as politicians and non-government organisations. Views were also gathered on what banking services and products might be appropriate in future. Framing the discussion in the context of how these stakeholders viewed NatWest Group provided a strong foundation from which to amplify our strategy.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nBuilding on the outputs of our stakeholder listening, our purpose-led strategic approach considered where and how we could drive new growth by becoming more relevant, and more trusted, in supporting our customers' financial lives. Our purpose was the core governing objective in defining our three growth areas and supported the assessment of specific initiatives.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nIn October 2022 the Board confirmed its support for a plan to amplify our strategy and will oversee progress in 2023.\n\nFurther information on our strategy, including the three growth areas, can be found on pages 22 to 23.\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022, shareholders supported our 'Say on Climate' resolution with 92.58% of votes cast in favour. This included the intention to publish a climate transition plan for the company to demonstrate progress against our ambition to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, assets under management and operational value chain.\n\nFollowing this, management continued work on the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan and provided regular updates to the Board, Group Sustainable Banking Committee and Group Audit Committee. Board and Committee feedback was incorporated into the development process, including the way in which progress against the plan would be measured and reported. Key dependencies discussed included government policies, customer behaviour changes and new technology development.\n\nAn external perspective was provided to the Board by NatWest Group's independent climate change adviser, Lord Stern. Board decision-making was further informed by a training session with Dr Sarah Ivory of the University of Edinburgh, NatWest Group's learning partner on climate change transformation.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their section 172 duties and how were stakeholders considered?\n\nDirectors were mindful of their duties under section 172 during their review of the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan and wider related considerations. Support for third parties to deliver their climate ambitions, including customers and suppliers, was discussed. The Board also considered how we were supporting customers and colleagues to ensure their actions complemented our long-term strategic direction on climate change. The Board supported management's decision to recommend that all suppliers complete an external assessment to help the transition of our operational value chain to net zero and nearer-term own operational footprint targets. During their visit to Bristol in September 2022, the directors discussed with suppliers their experience of undertaking the assessment and its impact.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nCreating and implementing the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan is critical to fulfilling our purpose and being sustainable.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nIn February 2023, the Board approved the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan included in the Climate-related Disclosures Report. Progress will be tracked at executive and Board level.\n\n## Approving the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan Factors considered:\n\n## Appointing a new non-executive director\n\n## Factors considered:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nOn 30 September 2022, the Board approved the appointment of Roisin Donnelly as an independent non-executive director with effect from 1 October 2022. The appointment followed a rigorous search process led by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee (Group N&G) on behalf of the Board.\n\nTo support the Board's decision, a detailed paper described how Ms Donnelly had been identified as the preferred candidate. Directors considered how the role specification criteria had been met and how the appointment would enhance the Board's composition, including its diversity.\n\nFollowing discussion, the Board approved the appointment, noting that Ms Donnelly would bring extensive customer, digital, ESG, marketing and branding experience to the Boardroom.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their section 172 duties and how were stakeholders considered?\n\nIn identifying the skills, knowledge and experience required at Board level to support delivery of NatWest Group's purpose and strategic priorities, a long-term view was taken.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, the Board discussed how Ms Donnelly's strengths in consumer markets, data and digital transformation would enhance the Board. It would also help with supporting business transformation and growth.\n\nIn the context of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, directors considered detailed character references from Ms Donnelly's current and previous Boards prior to approval, and in order to support their assessment of Ms Donnelly's fitness, propriety and suitability. Directors also noted that Ms Donnelly had sufficient time to devote to the role and that the UK Corporate Governance Code criteria on director independence would be met.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nEnsuring a diverse Board with an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience is critical in delivering effective Board oversight of the business, which in turn supports our purpose.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nSince joining the Board, Ms Donnelly has embarked on a tailored induction programme, spending time with key stakeholders to deepen her knowledge of the business and the context in which it operates.\n\nFurther details on the search process leading to Ms Donnelly's appointment can be found in the Group N&G report on pages 106 and 107.",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder focus areas\n\nListening, engaging and partnering with our stakeholders is vital for the success of our business. It helps us to address our operational impacts and improve outcomes for customers, society and the environment. In the following sections we detail some of the notable ways we have continued to support our stakeholders' requirements during 2022.\n\n## Building strong financial foundations\n\nScaling our financial capability education\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImproving financial capability sits at the heart of the bank's purpose.\n\nWe want to provide the people, families and businesses we serve with the skills and the confidence to manage their money better and take control of their finances.\n\nAnd with financial wellbeing concerns rising due to the increases in the cost of living, this has never been more important. In addition to our flagship financial capability programme for young people, MoneySense, our Financial Foundations pilot programme aims to help develop good money practices and financial resilience for adults.\n\nInitially, the Financial Foundations programme centred around a series of free, interactive workshops facilitated by trained bank colleagues for small groups of young adults, job seekers and survivors of domestic abuse.\n\nHowever, the financial challenges of 2022 meant there was a much wider interest in the programme from new audiences. As well as local authorities, social housing groups and higher education teaching staff, we received enquiries from large corporate and commercial clients.\n\nA.S. Watson Group is one such example. It operates over 1,300 retail stores across the UK and Republic of Ireland including the Savers and Superdrug brands, which employ around 20,000 people across these locations.\n\nWe delivered the Financial Foundations workshops as a webinar to a range of their colleagues, covering topics such as budgeting, planning for the unexpected and managing debt. The response to the sessions was excellent, with the group's head of Payroll, Shared Services & Reward noting that they prompted 'reflection on money management, personal spending habits and other important topics for our colleagues in this climate'.\n\nFollowing the success of these workshops, and to meet the growing number of requests, the Sustainable Banking team is now developing a variety of delivery methods to allow us to reach these new audiences at scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\n## Listening and responding to our customers\n\nWe want to know what our customers think about us. It helps us better understand their needs and improve the products and services we offer.\n\nTo achieve this, we have in place a framework of independent customer feedback surveys that measure satisfaction across our business segments. In 2022, Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for Retail Banking improved by 9 points for NatWest and 12 points for Royal Bank of Scotland. NatWest Business Banking NPS declined by 3 points and improved by 7 points for Royal Bank of Scotland. In Commercial Banking NPS improved by 3 points for NatWest and remained unchanged for Royal Bank of Scotland. Refer to page 44 for the full breakdown of scores.\n\nThe insight from these surveys is reported at the most senior levels of the bank and plays a crucial role in how we address the evolving requirements of our customers. In 2022, we incorporated customer feedback into a range of innovative solutions.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the cost of living crisis during 2022, we have helped our customers better manage their finances with a range of new features. Our new credit score feature in our mobile app helps customers understand their credit score, supporting them to improve their financial health. Meanwhile, the new Round Ups feature in our mobile banking app helps our customers save their small change every time they use their debit card or contactless device. To help build customers' financial capability and make sure they're getting the most from our digital tools, we introduced new insights into the Spending newsfeed on the NatWest and Royal Bank apps including Know Your Credit Score, Travel Checklist and Energy Anniversary. We are also the first UK high street bank to launch a bill-splitting function - Split Bill - in our banking app using Open Banking, making it simple to split bills with friends and family.\n\nTo support more startups with digital solutions we collaborated with Business Data Group (BDG), a business formation service, to make it simpler for new businesses to find our startup support and services, including accessing and opening our Start-Up Account, more quickly and easily. Collaborating with Cogo, we also launched the pilot of an app to selected manufacturing and transport business banking customers to track their carbon footprint using their transaction data.\n\n## Making banking more accessible\n\nWe recognise that our customers' individual needs are all different. As such, we aim to make banking as accessible as possible for everyone, offering our customers the ability to choose from a variety of face-to-face, digital and remote options. Customers can now also take greater digital control of their finances through our mobile app, including the ability to open an account, check their credit score and apply for a mortgage.\n\nOur app is compatible with both Apple and Android accessibility features such as inverting colours and magnifiers, as well as biometric log-ins. We have also introduced dark and light modes for customers with visual impairments or dyslexia.\n\nOur AI virtual assistant, Cora, supports customers via the 'message us' feature in the app, and our contact centre colleagues are just a click away with the 'tap to call' function. When our customers want the reassurance of a face-to-face conversation remotely, our video banking service is available. We offer customers who require additional support a range of accessibility services, such as accessible statements in braille, large print and audio CD. BT's Relay UK service also supports customers with hearing impairments through a type-to-talk service, while accessible card readers, rubber signature stamps, braille card wallets and our talking ATM service are other key accessibility features.\n\n## Supporting our customers\n\nAt any time, a customer may find themselves either in a vulnerable situation or caring for a loved one experiencing a vulnerability. During 2022, we were aware that cost of living pressures had the potential to make this a reality for many of our customers. As such, we initiated proactive contacts to customers in 2022 to offer support and information on the cost of living. We also launched an online cost of living hub to share resources and tools, and to inform customers of the support that is available to them through third parties. And throughout the volatility in the mortgage market in 2022, we remained open for business, ready to serve our customers.\n\nWe continued to support our customers in other ways as well. In collaboration with SafeLives, we have reached more than 2,000 domestic and economic abuse survivors through a \u00a31 million Circle Fund donation. The Fund has supported frontline services to provide crisis intervention, increase safety and help support recovery, after a dramatic rise in cases of abuse over lockdown. Our support for young people continued with the launch of our new pocket money product, NatWest Rooster Money, which helps children build money confidence and develop positive money habits around saving and spending. We have built a smooth connection to Rooster Money via the main mobile app and there have been c.89,000 Rooster Money card openings in 2022.\n\n## Cost of living support\n\nAs part of our response to the cost of living crisis the bank took action on a range of fees and charges for personal customers in financial difficulty and those receiving support from its Financial Health & Support team, this included waiving fees on products where appropriate to support customers experiencing financial difficulty. We also delivered 5.1 million (*) financial capability interactions in 2022, including carrying out c.0.7 million financial health checks. Meanwhile, to provide certainty to SMEs, Business Current Accounts remained available without a minimum charge and we froze the standard published tariffs on these accounts for 12 months. We also announced a \u00a31.25 billion lending package to our c.40,000 farming customers within the agriculture sector.\n\n- (*) Within the scope of EY assurance. Refer to page 70.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evolving sustainable design for our branches\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe know that achieving our overall climate ambition means significantly reducing our direct own operations emissions. Making our branches more sustainable is a vital part of this.\n\nSince 2020, we have been on a journey to improve and embed sustainable practices across all our branch locations.\n\nThis has included improving the EPC ratings of our buildings for better energy efficiency, the reuse of furniture to minimise waste, and the\n\nuse of natural, biodegradable or recycled and recyclable materials. In addition, LED lighting is being deployed throughout all our branches as standard to further reduce energy consumption.\n\nIn 2021, we delivered our first sustainable hub in Bristol: a dynamic space providing a safe and relaxing environment, focused on accessibility and supporting vulnerable customers, and which achieved the SKA (1) Silver accreditation\n\nImportantly, this also provided valuable insights into the practices we can deploy elsewhere in other branches.\n\nSince then, we have completed a further four sustainable hubs, all of which have also achieved the SKA Silver accreditation and, importantly, evolved our learning each time.\n\nWe have recently completed refurbishments at our Milton Keynes branch and in our drive towards 'circularity' we continue to maximise the use of pre-loved furniture and recycled materials, as well as implementing technology such as heat pumps and building management systems to assist with reducing energy requirements. This includes daylight energy saving lighting systems and timing clocks for external signage and marketing digital displays.\n\nBut our ambition is to do more. We will continue to improve our design practices and use only the most sustainable suppliers and materials with an aim of achieving Gold SKA accreditation in early 2023.\n\n- (1)  The SKA assessment scheme, which has been developed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), assesses the environmental impact of refurbishments and fitouts.",

sizes and keep us in line with industry best practice. Due to this methodology change we have seen an uplift in NPS scores for all brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investors\n\nA key milestone was reached in March 2022 when we agreed an off-market purchase of 550 million shares from UK Government Investments, for a total of \u00a31.2 billion. This took its stake in NatWest Group below 50% for the first time since 2008. Further selling by the government as part of its ongoing trading programme has reduced its stake further throughout the year.\n\n## Private investors\n\nWe engaged with our private investors through our Annual General Meeting, virtual shareholder events, and our annual and strategic report communications.\n\nThe AGM was held in April 2022 and, for the first time in two years, we were able to invite shareholders to attend in person. We also held a live virtual shareholder event a week prior to the AGM where shareholders were invited to submit questions in advance of and during the virtual event. A General Meeting and Class Meeting of ordinary shareholders were also held in August 2022 to approve a special dividend and an associated share consolidation of ordinary shares.\n\nIn addition, we held a further virtual shareholder event in November 2022. At this event, we spoke about the initiatives NatWest Group is involved in to support its customers. We also published a shareholder update on the topic, which set out initiatives such as the package of support for customers, colleagues and communities to help with the rising cost of living.\n\nThe virtual shareholder events remain a key component of our stakeholder engagement programme and provide an opportunity for shareholders to hear from, and ask questions of, Board members and senior management on topics such as innovation, enterprise, sustainability and our financial performance. It is our intention to deliver further virtual events in 2023. Our shareholder updates and recordings of our virtual shareholder events can be found on our website at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nOur well-established programme of global institutional investor engagement saw management host 322 meetings with equity investors and 242 meetings with fixed income investors in 2022. The financial year began with a presentation on our annual results in February 2022, hosted by our Chairman, CEO and CFO. This live event took place virtually and included an interactive Q&A session to give research analysts and investors an opportunity to ask questions and engage with our management team. Further quarterly results presentations took place virtually alongside the release of our financial results in April, July and October 2022.\n\nOur CEO and CFO engaged regularly with UK Government Investments and our largest active institutional investors throughout the year to update them on our progress. As in-person contact resumed in 2022, we hosted a hybrid programme of in-person and virtual one-to-one and group meetings with institutional investors from around the world.\n\nMeetings with investors covered key topics such as progress against our financial targets, interest rate sensitivity, capital return policy, environmental, social and governance topics, regulation and the macroeconomic environment. Throughout the year as market movements and investor sentiment were influenced by the war in Ukraine, energy prices, inflation and the wider macroeconomic outlook, meetings became more focused on these areas and the health of the UK consumer and corporate environment.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues were regularly discussed at our one-to-one meetings and we also engaged with specialist socially responsible investors via meetings with ESG analysts from institutional investors, and increased interactions with sustainability rating agencies. We further enhanced our ESG reporting suite with an inaugural Non-financial Information Datasheet to allow investors and analysts to more easily find data on our key ESG metrics. Our climate reporting received external recognition, winning the Best Climate-related Reporting Award at the 2022 ESG Reporting Award and the Accounting for Sustainability Finance for the Future Award.\n\nOur ongoing Investor Relations programme also allows investors the opportunity to hear from the wider management team. In June 2022 we hosted a data round table, inviting investors and analysts to join a presentation and Q&A on our data strategy. Throughout the year, our business CEOs and CFOs attended industry conferences and hosted broker-organised meetings with groups of investors on their specific business areas, allowing investors the opportunity to hear about their strategic priorities and recent business performance.\n\n## Say on Climate\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022, shareholders supported our 'Say on Climate' resolution with 92.58% of votes cast in favour. This included the intention to publish a climate transition plan for the company to demonstrate progress against our ambition to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, assets under management and operational value chain.",

By supporting them in what they do and by ensuring that NatWest Group is a great place to work, we can champion their potential and collectively deliver our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Listening to our colleagues\n\nWe listen to our colleagues and use this insight to attract, engage and retain the best talent for the future. Our colleague listening strategy contributes to our deeper understanding of colleague sentiment and includes: our colleague opinion surveys including pulse surveys; a Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) that connects colleagues directly with our Board; the Colleague Experience Squad, a group of colleagues who volunteer to provide feedback on colleague products and services; and Workplace, our social media platform. We also track metrics and key performance indicators which we can benchmark with sector and high-performing comparisons.\n\nOver 48,000 colleagues (82%) across all countries and levels participated in our September 2022 Our View survey 1 . At 82% this response rate is one of the highest seen in the last 10 years. In the face of an unprecedented external environment, our results remain strong and show overall resilience. However, lead measures in culture, wellbeing and purpose fell marginally, while our inclusion measure remained stable and, despite the challenging backdrop, our measure on building capability improved. Across all comparable categories, NatWest Group sits an average of six percentage points above the Global Financial Services Norm (GFSN) and two percentage points above the Global High Performance Norm (GHPN).\n\nRegular interactions with our employee representatives such as trade unions, elected employee bodies and works councils are a vital means of transparency and engagement for us. We frequently use these sessions to discuss developments and updates on the progress of our strategic priorities.\n\n(1)  NatWest Group Our View results exclude Ulster Bank RoI.\n\nOur CAP was set up in 2018 to help promote colleague voices in the boardroom. In 2022, topics included remuneration (including executives and the wider workforce), our values, future skills and the work being done to support customers in vulnerable situations. We also remain committed to respecting our employees' rights of freedom of association across all our business.\n\n## For full details on CAP refer to the Corporate governance report and ESG Disclosures Report.\n\n## Performance and reward\n\nPerformance management at NatWest Group is a continuous approach aligned to our ambition to be a learning organisation and to enable all colleagues to thrive and reach their full potential. At the core of our performance management approach are regular performance and development conversations between line managers and their colleagues.\n\n## Refer to our ESG Disclosures Report for full details.\n\nWe continue to ensure employees are paid fairly for the work they do and are supported by simple and transparent pay structures in line with industry best practices. We keep our policies and processes under review to make sure we do so. In the UK, our rates of pay continue to exceed the Living Wage Foundation benchmarks and we make sure employees performing the same roles are paid fairly. We help colleagues to have an awareness of financial and economic factors affecting our performance through quarterly Results Explained communications and Workplace Live events with our Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer. We announced a range of support measures in response to the cost of living crisis. In September 2022, we provided a permanent uplift in salary to our lower-paid employees. This targeted action was complemented by a one-off cash payment in January 2023 to most of the workforce and further significant investment in fixed pay from April 2023.\n\nRefer to our Directors' remuneration report for full details on our remuneration policies, cost of living support and employee share plans.\n\n## Helping colleagues realise their potential\n\nWe're investing in our workforce to deliver long-term, sustainable performance by providing our colleagues with the capabilities and future skills they need to fulfil their potential, underpinned by our ambition to be a learning organisation.\n\nWe have a significant focus on supporting all colleagues to be ready for the future and have given colleagues two days per year dedicated to developing priority future skills aligned to our Critical People Capabilities. Our ambition is that half of our elective learning is focused on future skills by the end of 2023. Our technology is supporting this by providing personalised recommendations for learning, gigs, mentors and jobs, based on colleagues' skills and skills interests.\n\nWe're supporting our businesses to close the future skills gap, through reskilling programmes, predominantly in data and digital. In 2022, 167 colleagues were reskilled for a new future-focused role or have actively participated in a programme. Our Talent Academy continues to develop our highest potential colleagues, with over 3,300 colleagues participating in 2022. Our pipeline of future talent continues with over 1,135 joining the bank through our early career programmes as interns, graduates and apprentices, which focus on building future skills including through our new financial crime graduate programme and our award-winning internship programme.\n\nOur leadership and coaching faculty supports leaders and their teams. Our new leadership experience, Thrive, launched in 2022 to give our leaders opportunities to learn and grow to lead themselves and their people. Our succession planning is purpose-led with our framework spotting, developing and mobilising a diverse pool of our most promising talent, supported by our ExCo.\n\nRefer to our ESG Disclosures Report for full details on how we support colleagues to realise their potential.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues' wellbeing\n\nWe recognise that taking proactive action to support positive mental health and wellbeing plays a crucial part in achieving our purpose. We were delighted to collaborate with Just Ask A Question (JAAQ), a new mental health and wellbeing social media platform that provides information from trusted experts, academics and people with lived experience.\n\nIn addition to our mental health focus, we worked with Peppy Health, launching a brand new digital product on menopause providing colleagues and their partners with online support and access to specialist clinicians.\n\nTo support our colleagues' financial wellbeing we launched the new NatWest Group Benefits Hub in 2022. The online platform allows employees to manage their benefits, pension and to access NatWest Group offers and discounts.\n\nWe also have a new market-leading partner leave policy from January 2023.

We talked and listened to around 11,000 colleagues, customers, community stakeholders and suppliers to understand what they value personally and what they value from us. And together we created, tested and refined our values with them.\n\nOur refreshed values of being Inclusive, Curious, Robust, Sustainable and Ambitious, were launched to colleagues, customers and communities in February 2022 and now inspire and guide us in everything we do.\n\nThese values are helping us to live our purpose on our journey to work as One Bank: to transform we need to be ambitious but sustainable. To work together we must be inclusive and curious and consider broad perspectives, not just work in silos. And, in everything we do, we must bring a robust commitment, act with integrity and make good decisions.\n\nTransformation isn't just about implementing our strategy or updating our technology, it's about thinking and acting differently, and our values are guiding us to do that.\n\nWhat's more, we're proud to say that these are values that have been created by our people, for our people.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It enables us to work together to achieve great things with our colleagues, communities and customers. We will stand up for people who are excluded, remove barriers that stop people progressing in their careers and create a safe, happy and healthy environment for all. We want to give everyone who works here, and every customer who comes into contact with us, the chance to succeed and the support to thrive.\n\n## Our contribution towards an inclusive workplace\n\nThe One Bank Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Action Committee chaired by Jen Tippin, Chief People and Transformation Officer, and Marg Jobling, Chief Marketing Officer, continues to take a focused and impactful approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). Three workstreams have been developed to drive action and change.\n\n## For full details refer to the ESG Disclosures Report.\n\nOver 36,000 colleagues have enrolled in our learning module Choose to Challenge which educates participants on the importance of challenging non-inclusive behaviours. We have also encouraged colleagues to take other learning modules such as LGBT+ Awareness and Disability Smart, to continue to build a more inclusive workplace in NatWest Group.\n\nWe launched a revised and improved Recruitment YES Check to ensure DE&I is front of mind at every stage of the recruitment process. We also introduced Inclusive Interview Ambassadors who are trained in technical aspects of interviewing, along with inclusion and identifying bias, to help bring an objective lens to the recruitment decision-making process. In 2022, we increased our team of ambassadors to over 800 and introduced them in India.\n\nSponsorship plays a key role in breaking down barriers to help under-represented groups progress into senior leadership roles. We have created a best practice sponsorship guide, with a clear framework to encourage leaders to advance and retain diverse talent, by taking responsibility for supporting and advancing individuals across the organisation.\n\nWe highlighted DE&I globally during our Inclusion Week in September 2022. #ThePowerofNow was the theme and events were centred around this topic globally, which included a talk from Dr Grace Lordan, founder of The Inclusion Initiative, as part of our Leadership Thrive Lounge on Leading Inclusively.\n\nWe continuously support our eight employee-led networks, which have around 24,000 members globally. We have also refreshed our Inclusion Champion programme for our c.1,000 registered champions.\n\n## For full details refer to the ESG Disclosures Report and natwestgroup.com.\n\nWe celebrated Race Equality Week in February 2022, with the theme of #ActionsNotJustWords and Black History Month in October 2022, focused on Black Visibility is Power. During Black History Month, a number of events showcased how visibility of Black professionals is driving change, and we published our annual Banking on Racial Equality Taskforce update.\n\nFollowing its relaunch in 2021, our Ethnicity Advisory Council, comprising nominated external specialists from different industries, continued to meet regularly to provide critical challenge, guidance and direction on our strategy.\n\nFor the fifth time, NatWest Poland organised the LGBT+ DIAMONDS AWARDS to recognise individuals and organisations making a real change for LGBT+ colleagues in Poland. The hybrid event had strong engagement with 160 nominations and over 50 partnering companies. NatWest Group was also the headline sponsor of Trans Festival in August 2022, an event in London focused on what businesses can do to support the Trans community. We ranked 49 th (up from 83 rd in 2018) in Stonewall's UK Workplace Equality Index and were awarded Gold status for inclusion.\n\nWe are a signatory of HM Treasury's Women in Finance Charter and our Executive Sponsor for Gender, David Lindberg (CEO, Retail Banking), is part of the external Accountable Executive Taskforce for the Charter. In 2022, we introduced the returnship initiative, which targets the women's returners market, to build our pipeline using a specialist recruitment partner. Our women's engineering reskilling programme, delivered with Code First Girls, won the Champions of Change category at the Management Today DE&I Leadership Awards 2022.\n\nOur Global Accessibility Working Group helps us to be an accessible bank by design, enabling all colleagues and customers to thrive. The group has three focus areas: to ensure colleagues understand what accessibility means and the benefits of inclusive design; to inform colleagues with the knowledge and skills to design and build our policies and processes inclusively; and to ensure accessibility is in our existing methods and frameworks. NatWest Group renewed our leadership status in the UK Government Disability Confident Scheme and we are working with Lexxic, our external neurodiversity specialists, to develop a roadmap to enhance our performance on neurodiversity for colleagues.\n\nOur ambition is to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the same opportunity to progress their career, irrespective of their socio-economic background. In 2022, we created the One Bank Socio-Economic Working Group, to further our work in this area.\n\nFor full details refer to the ESG Disclosures Report.\n\n## 'Respect, listening and opening up opportunity are key to an inclusive culture.'\n\n## Alison Rose\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Our progress and targets\n\nColleague sentiment on inclusivity remained strong in 2022, maintaining a score of 93 percentage points. Although sentiment has remained consistent in all our colleague groups, our focus remains on where scores may vary for our minority colleagues. We ran a smaller pulse survey in June 2022, focused on championing belonging, in which 95 percentage points of colleagues agreed NatWest Group does a good job of highlighting the importance of DE&I.\n\n## 2022 Our View inclusion score\n\n## 93%\n\n## 2021: 93%\n\n+8 vs GHPN (Global High Performance Norm) +9 vs GFSN (Global Financial Services Norm)\n\nOur Board composition exceeds the FTSE Women Leaders Review (formerly the Hampton Alexander Review) target of a minimum of 40% (*) women's representation on the board by 2025, with a figure of 45% women's representation. We have women representation of 29% on our executive management team with a woman Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief People and Transformation Officer, and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary.\n\nWe have a target to have full gender balance in our CEO-3 and above global roles by 2030. At 31 December 2022, we had, on aggregate, 40% women in our top three layers (*) , an increase of 2% since 31 December 2021. This represents an increase of 11% since targets were introduced in 2015. (**)\n\nThe mean gender pay gap for NatWest Bank, our largest reporting entity, is 28.7% (median: 31.6%) and the mean gender bonus gap is 30.4% (median: 17.5%). If we include recognition vouchers in our calculation, the bonus gap increases to 52.5% (median 90.2%). This means every colleague who received a small recognition award - for example \u00a310 - is included in the calculations, whether or not they received a bonus. Most colleagues in our more junior jobs only receive fixed pay - a change made to provide more certainty over earnings. We currently have a higher proportion of women in these roles. We believe the figures excluding recognition vouchers are more accurate reflections of our gender bonus gap.\n\n## For our full pay gap report refer to natwestgroup.com.\n\nIntroduced in 2018, our ethnicity target is to have 14% of colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds in CEO-4 and above positions in the UK by 2025. At 31 December 2022, of 82% of colleagues who disclosed their ethnicity, we have an aggregate 11% of colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds in our CEO-4 and above positions (*) . This represents a 3% increase since targets were introduced and remains consistent from 2021. Overall, of those who disclose their ethnicity, 19% of colleagues in the UK identify as being from an ethnic minority background.\n\nIn line with our commitment to transparency under the UK Government's Race at Work Charter, we have voluntarily disclosed our aggregated ethnicity pay gap for NatWest Group UK. The mean ethnicity pay gap for NatWest Group is 7.2% (median: 10.3%). The mean ethnicity bonus gap for NatWest Group, excluding recognition vouchers, is 21.8% (median: 16.9%). This year we have broken down our ethnicity pay gaps to compare Asian, Black, mixed/multiple and other ethnic minority colleague's average hourly pay to that of White colleagues for NatWest Group in Great Britain. This highlighted a wider pay gap between Black and White colleagues than the average ethnicity pay gap. The target set in 2021 to increase the number of Black colleagues in CEO-5 and above UK roles is intended, alongside other initiatives, to address underrepresentation in this area.\n\n## For our full pay gap report refer to natwestgroup.com.\n\nIn 2020 we launched the Racial Equality Taskforce to listen, learn and better understand barriers faced by colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds. The Taskforce set out 10 commitments in the Banking on Racial Equality Report, including a UK target to have Black colleagues occupying 3% of UK roles (CEO-5 and above) by 2025. At 31 December 2022, we have 1.5% of colleagues who identify as Black in CEO-5 and above roles in the UK, which remains consistent from 2021. Overall, of those who share their ethnicity, 3% of our colleagues in the UK identify as Black.\n\n## For our Banking on Racial Equality Report refer to natwestgroup.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor a full breakdown of our colleague data, including our gender and ethnicity profiles by level, Refer to our Non-financial information datasheet at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Companies Act 2006, section 414C (8)(c) disclosure\n\n|                                             | Male #   | Female #   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Directors of the company                    | 6        | 5          |\n| Executive employees                         | 69       | 26         |\n| Directors of subsidiaries                   | 182      | 64         |\n| Permanent employees   (active and inactive) | 31,500   | 30,600     |\n\nThere were 358 senior managers (in accordance with the definition contained within the relevant Companies Act legislation), which comprises our executive population and individuals who are directors of our subsidiaries.\n\n- UK Corporate Governance Code Provision 23: As at 31 December 2022, the gender balance of senior management and their direct reports was 33% female and 67% male.

Based on the management structures at the start of 2022, we had 41% women in our CEO-3 and above global roles as at 31 December 2022, an increase of 3% since 31 December 2021.

Our direct community investment in 2022 amounted to \u00a313.6 million (*) compared with \u00a37.3 million in 2021, as measured using the Business for Societal Impact benchmarking standard. This includes the funding we make available to support colleague giving and the direct costs of delivering our community programmes.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to promote our Do Good Feel Good campaign to give our colleagues opportunities to support the good causes they care about through volunteering their time and fundraising. Across all our fundraising and volunteering programmes, our colleagues gave back \u00a33.8 million and c.76,000 worktime volunteering hours, providing their skills and expertise to support a range of causes.\n\nOur popular challenge events in September 2022 offered colleagues across the UK free access to fundraising events which included walking, running, bungee jumping and abseiling. In addition, we matched all colleague fundraising throughout the month of September. Through this campaign, our colleagues raised \u00a3583,276 for charitable causes. Our 2021 Do Good Feel Good challenge events won Best Scheme to Encourage Staff Fundraising at The Better Society Awards in May 2022.\n\nTo celebrate Giving Tuesday, a global day of giving held on 29 November 2022, our colleagues donated \u00a3200,000 to charities through payroll giving. We also matched customer reward donations, raising \u00a3150,000. In recognition of the cost of living crisis, we also held three auctions of rare and collectable banknotes, donating the proceeds to The Trussell Trust, a charity which supports a network of foodbanks across the UK and which has seen demands on its services increase exponentially during 2022.\n\n## Community highlights\n\nc.76,000\n\nhours volunteered by our colleagues\n\nc.72,000\n\ntrees planted\n\n\u00a312m\n\ndonated to DEC appeals\n\n\u00a313.6m\n\nin direct community investment (*)\n\n- (1)  The Foundation's company registration number (CIN) is: U45200MH2007NPL167933\n- (2)  Charity Registration No: 802643\n- (3)  Charity Registration No: 1079626\n\nDuring 2022, our colleagues and customers donated to three appeals launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to support the humanitarian relief efforts in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Pakistan. This led to a donation of \u00a312 million to the DEC, including a \u00a32.7 million donation from NatWest Group. As a result, the DEC and NatWest Group won Gold for the most effective one-off campaign and Silver for the most innovative collaboration at the 2022 Corporate Engagement Awards.\n\nThrough our customer giving channels, including our mobile app, Reward Account and website, we facilitated customer donations amounting to \u00a37.6 million. Our mobile app has proved to be a successful channel for generating additional income for the charity sector and raised over \u00a34.6 million in 2022. In 2022, we introduced three new charities to the list of nominated charities our customers can donate to through their Reward Accounts. The three new charities are linked to our purpose and are helping to support people affected by the cost of living crisis.\n\nElsewhere Tyl, our card payment provider for businesses, donated \u00a3274,785 to charity. For every card payment, Tyl donates to charities and community projects around the country.\n\n## Delivering impact in our communities\n\nNatWest Group has three independent, well-established charities, which continue to support specific activities in line with our purpose, including The NatWest India Foundation (1) , the Coutts Foundation (2) and NatWest Social & Community Capital (3) .\n\nNatWest Social & Community Capital was established in 1999 and is supported by the bank. Its mission is to enable social enterprises, charities and community businesses to make a positive impact on communities across the UK through flexible loan finance.\n\nThe charity has a specific focus on organisations delivering employability, education and training for those furthest from the labour market, services for the most disadvantaged and community regeneration, and works with social ventures unable to access mainstream funding. In addition to lending, NatWest Social & Community Capital provides business support and expertise to its clients and has access to a pool of volunteers they can turn to for practical advice.\n\nNatWest Social & Community Capital was recognised as Nationwide Social Lender of the Year 2022 at the UK Enterprise Awards. It was also shortlisted for Social Investment Deal of the Year at the 2022 Social Enterprise UK Awards for a funding deal for social-led business, Northumbria Youth Action, which enabled the company to continue trading and develop young people's skills to help them enter employment.\n\n## Celebrating 15 years' working with The Conservation Volunteers\n\nIn November 2022, we were delighted to celebrate 15 years of working in partnership with The Conservation Volunteers, enabling our colleagues to give their time, energy and skills to support vital conservation projects across the UK. Together we have created new woodland areas, built new green parks and restored derelict land to community use. The impact of this work will be felt for years to come.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to provide colleagues opportunities to participate in our tree planting programme, helping them to make a positive contribution to tackling climate change, while improving natural environments, enjoying the benefits of being outdoors and working together as a team. In 2022, our colleagues planted c.72,000 trees, with 2,890 planted during a special event at our headquarters at Gogarburn, Edinburgh. This event was attended by our Coutts Scotland colleagues to celebrate Coutts' collaboration with The Queen's Green Canopy, an initiative inviting people and communities to plant a tree to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and to benefit the environment.\n\n## Banking on Racial Equality\n\nOur Banking on Racial Equality report, published in October 2020, set out 10 commitments to our customers, colleagues and communities from ethnic minority backgrounds and the actions - new and existing - that would help us meet those commitments.\n\nOn the second anniversary of the report in 2022, we published an update on our progress and identified areas where we still need to improve. To help build a more inclusive culture, we have introduced mandatory training for all colleagues and an ethnicity ally programme.\n\nFor the first time, and with oversight from the Board and Group Executive Committee, we have taken a bank-wide approach to assessing the health and diversity of succession planning at CEO-1 and CEO-2 levels for c.200 value-creating and specialist jobs, matching talent with the potential, aspirations and skills required to thrive in these roles.\n\nDuring 2022, we published 'Time to Change: A Blueprint for Advancing the UK's Ethnic Minority Businesses' with the Centre for Research in Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship at Aston University.\n\nHowever, there is much more we still need to do. By regularly tracking and disclosing our progress against our commitments, we can identify areas where more action is needed to deliver long-term change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How NatWest Group was able to help\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine, colleagues from right across the bank did what they could to help.\n\nDonations from NatWest Group colleagues and customers to the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal exceeded \u00a310 million. This included \u00a32.5 million matching from the bank, over \u00a32.3 million in Reward donations (including Gift Aid) and \u00a3284,000 (including Gift Aid) donated by colleagues through our SponsorMe page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGogarburn House, in the grounds of our head office in Edinburgh, was made available to the Scottish Government and Edinburgh City Council to use as a welcome centre for people displaced from Ukraine, and greeted over 10,000 people during the year since opening in April 2022. Importantly, we set out information on our customer websites (in Ukrainian and Russian) to help refugees arriving in the UK from Ukraine who were in need of bank accounts.\n\nWe also pledged \u00a3100,000 to support 500 Ukrainian students to continue their studies at Polish universities and polytechnics.\n\nMany of our colleagues felt the need to help directly. For Anna Majdak, based in our Warsaw office in Poland, this meant travelling to the border with Ukraine to directly offer her support.\n\nTogether with her husband and friends she set up a stall offering clothes and food to those crossing into Poland. They also transported people to the registration centre four kilometres from the crossing.\n\n'The first trip was a natural, spontaneous reaction', Anna recalls. 'What we saw there showed how much our help was needed and was in fact essential.'\n\n'We made a collection available so people could donate money for fuel and the purchase of necessary items. After a week at the border, our stall was fully equipped including a grill to provide hot food.'\n\nMany of the refugees Anna helped were children. 'There were many that crossed the border alone,' she says. 'They were able to wait with us being warmed up with blankets in our cars, until family members were able to pick them up.'\n\nElsewhere, our colleagues opened their homes to families fleeing the conflict, helped Ukrainians secure access to medical facilities and provided language classes.",

It details what we expect from our suppliers and outlines our commitments and the outcomes we aim to achieve by working together.\n\nWorking alongside the Group Chief People and Transformation Officer - the new Accountable Executive of our Supplier Charter - we have completed our annual review of the charter. The Supplier Charter continues to help us become a more sustainable business, delivering better outcomes for our customers, colleagues, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nCentral to its aims, we worked with EcoVadis, a leading provider of evidence-based assessments of sustainability performance. EcoVadis is helping us to understand and measure the performance of NatWest Group and our suppliers against core ESG pillars, enabling us to identify social, environmental, and ethical improvements.\n\nIn 2022, we made tangible progress, with over 531 suppliers scoring an average of 55.4% against the Global EcoVadis average of 44.8%. EcoVadis also conducted a sustainability assessment of NatWest Group, where we scored 62%, which is higher than the global EcoVadis average of 49% for the financial services sector.\n\n## Supporting our suppliers to net zero\n\nWe have an ambition to halve emissions from our operational value chain by 2030, against a 2019 baseline, with a minimum of a 90% reduction by 2050. We are focused on how we start to work with our suppliers and customers on understanding and reporting their own emissions and build the capability to measure and report these together. Our suppliers' data should help us to measure and monitor our own indirect climate impact which will enable us all to take the right steps towards net zero.\n\nWe are in the process of scoping out a multi-year programme to work with our supply chain to reduce carbon emissions. During Q4 2022, we undertook data analysis to understand the capability of our suppliers, where they are on the journey to net zero, and what help they might need to progress.\n\n## Prompt payment\n\nWe continue to pay our suppliers promptly for the services they provide to us. Our standard payment terms are 30 days, however, we have continued to maintain immediate payment on goods and services received, which supports our suppliers and the cost of living crisis. This goes significantly beyond our commitment undertaken as a signatory to the government's Prompt Payment Code, which requires payment to be made in 60 days.\n\nGood Business Pays is a campaign to end late or slow payments to suppliers. For the second year running, NatWest Group was recognised for fast payment throughout the company, winning the Fast Payer Award for a consecutive year, placing us in the top seven companies in 2022.\n\nNatWest Group | 2022 Annual Report and Accounts\n\n## Respecting human rights\n\nAt NatWest Group, we understand that businesses have an important role to play in promoting respect for human rights.\n\nWe seek to promote and respect human rights through the continued application of policies and practices covering our colleagues, customers and suppliers. Our approach to respecting human rights takes into account a range of international standards and principles including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We reviewed and updated our Human Rights Position Statement in 2022.\n\nTackling modern slavery is integral to our approach to human rights. We publish an annual modern slavery statement outlining the actions and steps we take to identify and address the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking within our own operations and wider value chain.\n\nIn 2022, we engaged with various stakeholders, including charities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and campaign groups on human rights to help grow our knowledge and understanding of the issues. We continued our membership of the Thun Group and the UN Global Compact's UK Modern Slavery Working Group and we report annually against the Principles for Responsible Banking, the Equator Principles and UN Global Compact.\n\nFurther information on our approach to human rights, including our annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, can be found at natwestgroup.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulators\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated market which continues to evolve. As such, we understand the need to have an ongoing, constructive and open dialogue with all relevant regulatory bodies.\n\n## Ongoing dialogue\n\nDuring 2022, this included bilateral responses to material consultations or other requests for comment and input from various government, regulatory and standard-setting bodies. Key consultation responses included the FCA's Consumer Duty proposals and the Payment Systems Regulator's proposals on Authorised Push Payment (APP) scams.\n\nWe formally engage with our regulators, at senior executive and Board level, as well as via individual non-executive directors, through continuous assessment and proactive engagement meetings. Most notably, during 2022, we kept our regulators fully informed of contingencies and impacts on our operations as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis.\n\n## Watch the story online\n\nThe QR code above directs to a case study video on our 2022 Annual Report webpage.

A key part\n\nof this is providing financing structures for businesses that are developing sustainable energy.\n\nOne such business is electric vehicle fleet and battery storage specialist . Established in 2017, currently works with the majority of major bus operators in the UK, as well as local authority-owned bus companies, to electrify their fleets and minimise the lifetime costs of their electric vehicles (EV) and charging infrastructure. The company also provides battery storage solutions to grid operators, accelerating the uptake of renewables.\n\nBy 2025, aims to have a fleet of at least 3,000 EV buses, and 1GW of battery storage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo support this ambition, the company has established a funding platform with an initial volume of \u00a3241 million, which will enable it to service and finance up to 430 new e-buses in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\nHaving worked with NatWest Group on an innovative financing facility in 2021, turned to our team again to advise on a multi-source debt structure to help accelerate the expansion of the EV fleet sector.\n\nOur One Bank team, comprising colleagues from Private Placements, Specialist Asset Financing, Risk Solutions, ESG Advisory and Climate & ESG Capital Markets, collectively delivered a bespoke funding package. This incorporated green loans and private placements that adhered to the Loan Market Association's Green Loan Principles attracting institutional investors and bank lenders.\n\nWe believe this financing will have a real-world impact for accelerating the UK's drive to electrify its public road transport system.\n\nCombined with 's technical expertise, the funding enables the company to offer end-to-end services to the bus operators including the design, installation, financing and operation of electrical charging infrastructure and buses in the depot.\n\nThis is a clear example of our purpose in action: building relationships with businesses such as , championing its potential and empowering it to deliver on its sustainability ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

(1)\n\nWe plan to reduce emissions for our operational value chain by 50%, against a 2019 baseline.\n\n## How we are helping to address the climate challenge\n\n## Supporting customer transition to net zero\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a target to provide \u00a3100 billion climate and sustainable funding and financing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025. As part of this we aim to provide at least \u00a310 billion in lending for EPC A and B rated residential properties between 1 January 2023 and the end of 2025.\n\nWe have an ambition to support our UK mortgage customers to increase their residential energy efficiency and incentivise purchasing of the most energy efficient homes, with an ambition that 50% of our mortgage portfolio has an EPC rating of C or above by 2030.\n\n## Helping to end the most harmful activities\n\nWe plan to phase out of coal for UK and non-UK customers who have UK coal production, coal fired generation and coal related infrastructure by 1 October 2024, with a full global phase out by 1 January 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Powerful partnerships and collaborations\n\nWe plan to collaborate cross industry and create products and services to enable customers to track their carbon impact.\n\nFor details on our approach to Nature and Biodiversity refer to the 2022 NatWest Group plc Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Disclosures Report.\n\nNotes:\n\n- (1)  Refer to pages 38 to 39 of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative's Initial Target Disclosure Report (May 2022).\n\n## Climate transition plan and dependencies\n\nAchievement of our Climate transition plan is dependent on timely, appropriate government policy, technology developments, as well as on our customers and society to respond. At the same time, as a purpose-led organisation, we aim to engage and support our customers' transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nRefer to section 3 of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Climaterelated Disclosures Report for further details.\n\nFor further detail on our climate ambitions and SBTi targets refer to sections 1.3 and 3.3 of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n## Getting our own house in order\n\nEach year, we plan to include targets\n\nfor executive remuneration that\n\nreflect our latest climate ambitions.\n\nWe plan to continue the integration of the financial and non-financial risks arising from climate change into our enterprise-wide risk management framework (EWRMF).\n\nWe have a target to reduce our direct own operations emissions by 50% by 2025, against a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe plan to use only renewable electricity in our direct own global operations by 2025 (RE100) and improve our energy productivity 40% by 2025 against a 2015 baseline.\n\nThe table below outlines progress during 2022 - which supports our ambition to be a leading bank in the UK helping to address the climate challenge. Aligned with our ambition to set sector specific targets, during 2022 we published 2030 targets validated by the SBTi as science based. These targets included our own operational footprint as well as 79% of our 2019 lending book.

We have come a long way since activists protested against our financing of oil, gas and coal in 2010. In 2011, we launched our Environmental, Social & Ethical (ESE) Risk Framework, which required enhanced due diligence for certain lending and loan underwriting customer relationships, transactions, activities and projects. We recognise that through our financing activity NatWest Group may contribute to climate change. As the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan illustrates, we are committed to playing our part in addressing the climate challenge, but we cannot transform the real economy on our own. Ultimately, success will be determined by society's willingness to adapt, supported by consistent, long-term government policy and continuing technical innovation.\n\nFounding members of Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and member of Powering Past Coal Alliance.

In addition, cross-bank climate-related forums continue to provide strategic insight and expertise, supporting collaboration and ensuring a One Bank approach to climate governance.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to build knowledge and further embed operating models and business processes across the organisation to support the oversight and management of climate-related risks and opportunities within NatWest Group's overall business strategy and risk appetite.\n\nNatWest Group plc 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4\n\n## Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on NatWest Group's businesses, strategy and financial planning\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities identified over the short, medium and long term\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's climate ambition, announced in February 2020, recognises various short, medium and long-term (1) climate-related risks and opportunities to embed climate in our business and culture, as well as support our customers in their transition to net zero.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to integrate climate-related decision-making in business activities.\n\n## NatWest Group plc 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 5.1\n\nThe impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses, strategy and financial planning\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n- \u00b7 We developed the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan. This plan focuses on the delivery of our 2030 decarbonisation ambitions and will inform further work on our journey to net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, assets under management and our operational value chain.\n- \u00b7 We have enhanced the financial planning process to incorporate actions included within the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan and also used the financial forecasts to consider impacts on our Climate transition plan.\n- \u00b7 We continued to harness climate-related opportunities including providing climate and sustainable funding and financing and a range of green loan products and services.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n- \u00b7 We will continue to work on aligning the financial planning and transition planning processes.\n- \u00b7 We will further enhance carbon planning, measurement and tracking capability to support the ongoing development of our Climate transition plan.\n\n## NatWest Group plc 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2,3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.2. 4.2a, 4.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7\n\nThe resilience of our strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n- \u00b7 We ran internal scenario analysis and completed round two of the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise, as well as developing internal scenario analysis tools and core strategic climate risk modelling capabilities to embed within our existing risk management processes.\n- \u00b7 This work allowed us to assess our exposure to climate-related risk across our lending book and provided insights which we continue to incorporate within our climate strategy and to inform work on the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\n- \u00b7 One of the key lessons from this work is that while climate-related risks could potentially amplify other risk drivers, for example resulting in effects such as the erosion of competitiveness, profitability, or reputational damage, overall NatWest Group is resilient to these risks, within the context of the scenarios tested, and we will continue to monitor and manage this through our enterprise-wide risk management framework (EWRMF).\n- \u00b7 A priority area of focus for NatWest Group in 2022 has been the continued enhancement of how we incorporate climate risk into our capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and strategic planning process. This ensures that we have sufficient capital for the most material source of climate risk over the capital planning horizon.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to enhance scenario modelling and analytic capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Address significant challenges related to the availability of granular, reliable and verifiable customer data.\n- \u00b7 Respond to developing regulatory requirements on the approach to climate-related risk within the regulatory capital regime.\n\n## NatWest Group plc 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report sections 4.2a, 5.5\n\n- (1)  Our climate transition planning uses different time frames than those used in financial reporting. Accordingly, the references to 'short', 'medium' and 'long-term' in climate reporting are not indicative of the meaning of similar terms used in in certain of our other disclosures, including our annual, periodic and interim reports.",

        "page_content": "## Own operational footprint\n\nDuring 2022 (1) , we reduced our direct own operations (2) emissions by 46%, against our 2019 baseline, and increased our renewable electricity consumption to 98% globally.\n\nIn 2021, we disclosed an initial view of our upstream (3) emissions, and for 2022 we are disclosing both our upstream and our downstream (4) emissions to report on our full operational value chain (5) emissions for the first time, covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (all relevant categories 1-14, with category 15 financed emissions covered in section 5.5 of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Climaterelated Disclosures Report).\n\nOur 2022 total market-based operational emissions of 73,927 tCO2e covers Scopes 1, 2 and our direct own operations upstream Scope 3. This includes emission reductions from the use of green electricity covering 98% of our consumption through green tariffs and renewable electricity certificates, but in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol it does not include emissions reduction from the use of carbon credits.\n\nWe purchased and retired 120,000 carbon removal credits, assured under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), and Triple Gold certified to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance Standards (CCBA) to invest beyond our value chain, and provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for people and nature (6) . By investing beyond our value chain, these carbon credits mitigate direct operational emissions of 73,927 tCO2e in 2022, while we continue to decarbonise in line with SBTi. Further detail of our decarbonisation plans can be found in the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan in section 3.7 of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Climate-related Disclosures Report and on our website at natwestgroup.com.\n\nOur operational emission reductions are linked to remuneration. For further information, refer to the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 138.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nWe have used a spend-based approach (7) to calculate our supplier emissions. In late 2022, we established a (multi-year) Supplier Decarbonisation Programme to support delivery of the 2030 and 2050 carbon reduction ambitions related to our operational value chain. This will involve collaborating with our suppliers to understand their capability, data, where they are on the journey to net zero, and what help they might need to progress.\n\nWe are also working with a third party to evaluate our supply chain using evidence-based assessments of sustainability performance enabling us to understand our wider impact and to identify where improvements can be made, and risks mitigated.\n\nAs part of increasing the sustainability of our cash and coin operations, we have engaged our suppliers to reduce the\n\namount of single-use plastic coming in and going out of our cash centres and to improve the accuracy of data for our waste streams.\n\nFor our properties, the suppliers we work with must have environment and quality management accreditations and products used in fitouts should meet all Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors SKA criteria as standard.\n\n## Energy\n\nFollowing the return to the office after the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, we focused on the practice of using energy more efficiently and effectively in our operations and reviewed our processes to reduce consumption.\n\n- \u00b7 Building energy optimisation: our building plant equipment is continuously reviewed to maximise energy efficiency. Data analytics are used to proactively identify anomalous consumption, ensuring our buildings run more efficiently.\n- \u00b7 Energy audits: there have been audits carried out in most of our buildings this year to identify where we can improve energy efficiency and reduce consumption and this work will continue in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Data centres: we have consolidated our data centres to allow for more efficient IT architecture using fewer resources. The work carried out ensures they run more efficiently, with lighting upgrades and optimisation of the data hall environmental controls already seeing a significant reduction in water and power usage.\n- \u00b7 Renewable electricity: in 2021, we committed to a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (cPPA), bringing additional renewable generation capacity online to facilitate the decarbonisation of the UK grid. We are continuing to work towards this with additional cPPAs, and once constructed they are expected to generate 59% of NatWest Group's electricity demand in the UK by 2024.\n- \u00b7 Leased buildings: for our leased buildings in India, we are working with the landlords to review the scope for identifying energy-saving opportunities, assessing end of life for equipment, and creating an energy efficient replacement plan where possible.\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement: we launched a bank-wide energy campaign in the second half of 2022 to help educate and engage our colleagues by sharing tips on how to reduce consumption at home and in the office through a series of activities, raising the importance of energy saving actions. This is an ongoing campaign which we will continue to work on in 2023.\n- (1)  Our own operational footprint reporting year runs from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022.\n- (2)  NatWest Group defines direct own operations as our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (paper, water, waste, business travel, commuting and work from home) emissions. It therefore excludes upstream and downstream emissions from our value chain.\n- (3)  Upstream emissions relate to the Scope 3 Categories 1-8 under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n- (4)  Downstream emissions relates to the Scope 3 Categories 9-15 under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n## Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR)\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                        | 2022                       | 2022                                       | 2021                       | 2021                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions                                                                                                                                         | UK and   offshore (1) area | Global total  (excluding UK  and offshore) | UK and   offshore (1) area | Global total  (excluding UK   and offshore) |\n| Emissions from the combustion of fuel and operation of any facility   (Scope 1 (2)  Direct) CO2e (tonnes) (*)                                                          | 14,877                     | 1,363                                      | 17,560                     | 1,650                                       |\n| Emissions from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling  by the company for its own use (Scope 2 (3)  Indirect) location-based  CO2e emissions (tonnes) (*) | 47,546                     | 15,430                                     | 56,461                     | 18,159                                      |\n| Total gross Scope 1 & Scope 2 (location-based) emissions CO2e (tonnes) (*)                                                                                             | 62,423                     | 16,793                                     | 74,021                     | 19,809                                      |\n| Energy consumption used to calculate above emissions (kWh)                                                                                                             | 298,262,392                | 35,070,567                                 | 329,317,585                | 40,484,981                                  |\n| Intensity ratio: Location-based CO2e emissions per FTE   (Scope 1 & 2) (tonnes/FTE)                                                                                    | 1.6                        | 1.0                                        | 1.8                        | 1.1                                         |\n| Scope 3 (4)  CO2e emissions from direct operations (5)  (tonnes) (*)                                                                                                   | 39,559                     | 15,743                                     | 36,197                     | 8,967                                       |\n| Total gross Scope 1, 2 & 3 direct own operations (location-based) emissions  CO2e (tonnes) (*)                                                                         | 101,982                    | 32,536                                     | 110,218                    | 28,776                                      |\n| Intensity ratio: Location-based CO2e emissions per FTE   (Scope 1, 2 & direct operations Scope 3) (tonnes/FTE)                                                         | 2.5                        | 2.0                                        | 2.7                        | 1.7                                         |\n| Scope 2 (6)  (Indirect) market-based CO2e emissions (tonnes) (*)                                                                                                       | 13                         | 2,372                                      | 8                          | 2,186                                       |\n\n## Emissions methodology and basis of preparation\n\nBoundary: this statement has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the Companies (Directors' Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 which implement the government's policy on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting. Our reporting year runs from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. The emissions reporting boundary is defined as all entities and facilities either owned or under our operational control.\n\nCalculation: emissions have been calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and associated guidance and include all greenhouse gases, reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and global warming potential values. When converting data to carbon emissions, we use Emission Factors from UK Government Emissions Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2021, CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (International Energy Agency, 2021) or relevant local authorities as required. NatWest Group uses a third-party software system, to capture and record our environmental impact and ensure that control framework and assurance requirements are met. All data is aggregated at a regional level to reflect the total regional consumption. The regional consumption results are then collated to reflect the total NatWest Group footprint. CO2e values are attributed to these sources via an automatic conversion module in the third-party system. For more information, please see the own operational footprint page at natwestgroup.com.",

        "page_content": "## Risk overview\n\nEffective risk management ensures that NatWest Group delivers its long-term strategy and fulfils its purpose.\n\n## Our approach to risk management\n\nThe enterprise-wide risk management framework (EWRMF) sets out our approach to managing risk across NatWest Group and provides a common risk language and framework to facilitate effective risk management. The framework applies to all subsidiary legal entities, business segments and functions and links each component of the framework to help deliver NatWest Group's strategy in a safe and sustainable way.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nNatWest Group's multi-year programme to enhance risk management capability at every level of the organisation continued in 2022, with an ongoing emphasis on risk culture. We refreshed our approach to risk culture under a new banner of intelligent risk-taking, intensifying focus on robust risk management behaviours and practices.\n\nEvolving our risk culture, in line with our purpose-led strategy and our values across all three lines of defence, enables us to support better customer outcomes, develop a stronger and more sustainable business, and deliver an improved cost base. During 2022, five key outcomes to deliver on the intelligent risk-taking approach were also identified. These outcomes focused on behaviours, leadership, risk practices, decisionmaking, and roles and responsibilities.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nNatWest Group's governance structure facilitates sound risk management decision-making, in line with standards of good corporate governance. The Board reviews and approves the EWRMF and monitors performance against risk appetite. In addition, the key risk committees have the following roles and responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board Risk Committee (BRC) is responsible for providing oversight of current and potential future risk exposures, risk profile, risk appetite and risk culture. The BRC also oversees the effectiveness of the EWRMF across NatWest Group, and reviews the performance of NatWest Group relative to risk appetite and risk policy.\n- \u00b7 The Group Executive Risk Committee (ERC) reviews, challenges and debates all material risk and control matters across NatWest Group. It supports the CEO and other accountable individuals in discharging their risk management accountabilities. It considers NatWest Group's risk profile relative to current strategy and oversees implementation of the risk management framework.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nIn line with industry best practice and sound risk governance principles, NatWest Group adopts a three lines of defence model of risk governance. Everyone has a responsibility for the intelligent management of risk in day-to-day activities. This includes actively demonstrating risk practices and behaviours that are consistent with NatWest Group's desired risk culture.\n\nAs the second line of defence, the Risk function has a clear mandate to undertake proactive risk oversight and monitoring of all risk management activities. The Risk function designs and maintains the EWRMF. The Chief Risk Officer leads the Risk function and plays an integral role in advising the Board on NatWest Group's risk profile. This includes continuous monitoring activities to confirm that NatWest Group engages in sustainable risk-taking activities in pursuit of strategic objectives.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe risk appetite framework is a component of the EWRMF and establishes the extent of permissible risk-taking to support business outcomes and delivery of the strategy. The EWRMF sets out the requirements on how risk appetite is implemented through risk policies and standards and translated into operational procedures. This consistent approach is followed for all principal risks, frameworks, tools and techniques to support efficient and effective consolidation and interpretation.\n\n## Risk directory and principal risks\n\nTo ensure common language and a consistent approach across NatWest Group, the risk directory defines and documents all principal risks that NatWest Group may face, categorised into financial and non-financial risks. The risk directory is an important component of the EWRMF, underpinning the linkage between strategy, risk appetite, risk reporting and governance.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC)\n\nNatWest Group is committed to ensuring it acts responsibly and ethically, both when pursuing its own business opportunities and when awarding business. Consequently, it has embedded appropriate policies, procedures and controls so that its employees, and any other parties it does business with, understand these obligations and abide by them whenever they act for NatWest Group. ABC training is mandatory for all staff on an annual basis, with targeted training appropriate for certain roles. NatWest Group considers ABC risk in its business processes including, but not limited to, corporate donations, charitable sponsorships, political activities and commercial sponsorships. Where appropriate, ABC contract clauses are required in written agreements.\n\n## Enterprise-wide risk management framework\n\n| Risk culture                                    | Risk governance                                 | Three lines of defence                          | Risk appetite                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Common risk language, architecture and approach | Common risk language, architecture and approach | Common risk language, architecture and approach | Common risk language, architecture and approach |\n| Risk directory and principal risks              | Risk directory and principal risks              | Risk directory and principal risks              | Risk directory and principal risks              |\n| Financial risks                                 | Financial risks                                 |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Credit risk                                     | Credit risk                                     | Non-financial risks                             | Non-financial risks                             |\n| Non-traded market risk                          | Non-traded market risk                          | Financial crime risk                            | Financial crime risk                            |\n| Capital adequacy                                | Capital adequacy                                | Operational risk                                | Operational risk                                |\n| Liquidity and funding                           | Liquidity and funding                           | Regulatory compliance risk                      | Regulatory compliance risk                      |\n| Earnings stability                              | Earnings stability                              | Model risk                                      | Model risk                                      |\n| Pension risk                                    | Pension risk                                    | Reputational risk                               | Reputational risk                               |\n| Traded market risk                              | Traded market risk                              | Traded market risk                              | Traded market risk                              |\n| Climate risk                                    | Climate risk                                    |                                                 |                                                 |\n\n## Top and emerging threats\n\nTop and emerging threats are a component of the EWRMF and identify and manage threats that could have a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or deliver NatWest Group's strategy. They are specific scenarios that usually combine elements of several principal risks and require a coordinated management response. Top and emerging threats are subject to regular review by senior governance forums including the Board, ERC and BRC.\n\nHorizon-scanning is an important activity, enabling NatWest Group to identify, assess and mitigate top and emerging threats including via strategic planning. A range of methods are used including internal working groups, scenario analysis and consulting with external experts to ensure an external perspective is incorporated. In 2022, there was increased focus on assessing and understanding how different individual risks and threats are correlated with each other, including via scenario analysis. This approach helps to integrate strategic risk considerations into business processes and planning and strategy.\n\n## Additional areas of risk focus\n\nOperational risk: A payment review was initiated in late 2022, to assess control enhancements in response to manual payment risk.\n\nModel risk: Models are increasingly used as a key basis for informing important business decisions. It is therefore necessary to understand the potential for adverse consequences from model errors and the potential for inappropriate use of modelled outputs. Ensuring models used by NatWest Group are designed effectively - and that model assumptions and techniques remain fit for purpose - continued to be a key risk management focus in 2022. This included a programme of ongoing work to upgrade a number of models to improve performance and compliance with new regulatory requirements.\n\nCompliance and conduct: Further progress was made on the compliance agenda during 2022. The first line of defence ring-fencing hub, established to provide an aggregated view of ring-fencing compliance and risk management, continued to work across business areas, functions and legal entities to support completion of the attestation of compliance with the PRA rules, as at the end of December 2022. From a conduct risk perspective, the focus on consumer protection continued during 2022, given cost of living challenges and their impact on customers in vulnerable situations, as well as the FCA's increased expectations under Consumer Duty. The establishment of the Consumer Duty One Bank programme will ensure continued focus on delivering the required 'paradigm shift' in the levels of consumer protection.",

The outlook for the UK and global economy  remains uncertain including due to falling economic activity, high inflation, rising interest rates,  elevated energy prices, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                               | Climate change                                | Climate-related risks represent a source of systemic risk in the global financial system.  Financial and non-financial risks from climate change can arise through physical and transition  risks. In addition, physical and transition risks can trigger further losses, stemming directly  or indirectly from legal claims, litigation and conduct liability (referred to as liability risk).   As a result, NatWest Group and its customers, suppliers and counterparties face significant  climate-related risks. Further progress was made in 2022 in managing climate-related risks,  including progress with embedding climate risk into NatWest Group's risk framework, financial |\n|                                               | Cyber threats                                 | NatWest Group experiences a constant threat from cyberattacks across the entire NatWest  Group and against NatWest Group's supply chain.

The budget and business planning processes are based on a five-year horizon. However, a three-year period is considered more suitable given levels of uncertainty increase as the time horizon extends.\n\nIn assessing NatWest Group's viability over the three-year time frame, the Board has considered a wide range of information including:\n\n## Strategic and financial outlook\n\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's business and strategic plans.\n- \u00b7 Current capital position and projections over the relevant period.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity and funding profile and projections over the relevant period.\n- \u00b7 Internal scenarios and stress tests, which consider the material risks and uncertainties facing NatWest Group.\n\n## Risk management and risk profile\n\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's enterprise-wide risk management framework (EWRMF) including the processes by which risks are identified and mitigated.\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's risk profile including any breaches of risk appetite and top and emerging threats that could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to operate.\n\n## Regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 Mandatory regulatory requirements including activity related to the completion of the Bank of England annual cyclical stress (ACS) test, the 2022 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and the 2022 Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP).\n\n## Operating environment\n\n- \u00b7 Consideration of the wider operating environment for NatWest Group including legal, regulatory and competitive factors.\n\n## Assessment\n\nNatWest Group's business and strategic plans, which are reviewed and evaluated on an annual basis at minimum, provide long-term direction and assess resilience to a range of risks across the planning horizon. These plans include multi-year forecasts assessing NatWest Group's expected financial position throughout the planning period.\n\nA suite of economic scenarios supports NatWest Group's financial planning processes. Stress testing is a key risk and financial management tool and is also integrated with financial planning processes. It is used to quantify and evaluate the potential impact of material risks on the financial strength of NatWest Group, including its liquidity and capital position.\n\nGiven elevated levels of uncertainty in 2022, a broad range of economic scenarios was designed to capture uncertainties and risks faced by NatWest Group. The scenarios were continuously refined and reviewed. In the second half of 2022, this included benchmarking against external forecasts and regulatory stress tests. These scenarios explored principal risks and uncertainties including:\n\n- \u00b7 Elevated geopolitical risks including Russia and Ukraine and the impact of high and volatile energy prices.\n- \u00b7 Deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economy.\n- \u00b7 High and sustained levels of inflation and higher-thananticipated UK interest rates.\n- \u00b7 A sharp slowdown in the UK housing market including large falls in UK house prices, reduced mortgage lending and an increase in mortgage servicing costs.\n- \u00b7 Climate-related risks including those related to a disorderly climate transition.\n\nThese internal scenarios were used to examine going concern capital requirements on a forward-looking basis by assessing the resilience of capital adequacy and leverage ratios. The assessment included assumptions about regulatory and accounting factors (such as IFRS 9). They also incorporated key assumptions on balance sheet and P&L drivers, such as impairments, to demonstrate that NatWest Group maintains sufficient capital. Applying the scenarios to NatWest Group's capital, liquidity and funding positions did not result in a breach of any regulatory thresholds.\n\nReverse stress testing is also carried out in order to identify circumstances that may lead to specific, defined outcomes such as business failure. Reverse stress testing allows potential vulnerabilities in the business model to be examined more fully. During 2022, reverse stress testing considered the impact of sustained income challenges and increased impairments in a recession. The analysis concluded that a significant drop in UK GDP (-15% to -20%), coupled with high unemployment (13% to 16%), a collapse in house prices (-44% to -48%) and a dramatic reduction in asset prices (commercial real estate values falling by up to 78%) is required for NatWest Group to breach its defined thresholds, which are currently deemed to be implausible scenarios.\n\nConsideration was also given to the operational resilience of NatWest Group across a range of operational risk scenarios including conduct, financial crime, climate and a cyberattack. While NatWest Group has not been subject to a material cyberattack and operates a multi-layered system of defences, there is a possibility that a cyberattack could have a severe effect on operations. The evolving threat is continually monitored with a focus on managing the impact of any attack and sustaining availability of services for NatWest Group's customers. As cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group continues to invest in additional capability designed to defend against emerging threats.\n\nRisks facing NatWest Group are identified and assessed through NatWest Group's EWRMF which is outlined in the Risk overview section. The Board reviews and approves the EWRMF and monitors performance against risk appetite.\n\nDespite elevated economic and political uncertainty, NatWest Group's risk profile remained stable in 2022. Risk appetite is a key consideration in assessing the risk profile and the Board monitors performance against risk appetite including in relation to credit risk, liquidity and funding, financial crime, conduct and operational risk. In 2022, there were no material breaches in risk appetite that were viewed as a threat to the viability of NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's top and emerging threats process also highlights threat scenarios that could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to operate or deliver its strategy. In 2022, the top and emerging threats were subject to regular review by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. This included horizon scanning activity, to enable early identification and mitigation of emerging strategic threats. Top and emerging threats are also a significant consideration in internal scenario planning as well as the ICAAP and ILAAP.\n\nNatWest Group is impacted in the longer term by a wide range of macroeconomic, political, regulatory, technological, social and environmental developments. The evolving operating environment presents opportunities and risks which NatWest Group continue to evaluate including via top and emerging threats.\n\nThe 2022 Annual Report and Accounts were considered as part of the assessment. This includes review of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 64 to 67 and highlights the possible impact of legal, regulatory and competitive factors on NatWest Group. The detailed disclosure of financial performance of NatWest Group was considered as part of the assessment. This included:\n\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's robust capital position; CET1 ratio of 14.2%. The current capital position provides significant headroom above both NatWest Group's minimum requirements and its maximum distributable amount threshold requirements.\n- \u00b7 The sustainable profitability and capital generation of the business.\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group's strong liquidity and funding position with a robust liquidity coverage ratio of 145%, \u00a352 billion of excess over the regulatory minimum of 100% and a net stable funding ratio of 145%.\n\nNatWest Group participates in stress tests run by regulatory authorities to test industry-wide vulnerabilities under crystallising global and domestic systemic risks. The Bank of England returned to the annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress-test framework in 2022 and published the scenario in September 2022. The ACS scenario was considered when calibrating the internal scenarios and therefore informed the Board's assessment of viability.\n\nThe 2022 ACS was aimed at testing the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, large falls in asset prices and higher global interest rates, and a separate stress of misconduct costs. The Bank of England will publish results of the ACS in summer 2023.\n\nNatWest Group also took part in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) conducted in late 2021 and early 2022, with the results published by the Bank of England in May 2022. Insight from the analysis carried out to support participation in the CBES supported further embedding of climate risk into NatWest Group's business model, operations and risk framework in line with regulatory expectations.\n\nBased on the factors outlined above, the current financial forecasts including the strength of its capital and liquidity positions, the management of NatWest Group's principal risks, including mitigating actions, the Board has a reasonable expectation that NatWest Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities over the three-year period of the assessment.",

Go-forward income, excluding notable items, was \u00a313.1 billion, exceeding our income guidance for the year, and we achieved our cost reduction target of around 3%. A net impairment charge of 9 basis points was in line with guidance and, whilst default levels remain low, we continue to monitor the evolving economic outlook. This strong operating performance was net of a \u00a31.0 billion attributable loss from our continued withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nTotal income increased by 26.1% to \u00a313,156 million compared with 2021. Excluding notable items, income was \u00a32,877 million, or 28.3%, higher than 2021 driven by volume growth, increased transactional related fees, higher trading income and favourable yield curve movements. Bank NIM of 2.85% was 55 basis points higher than 2021.\n\nTotal operating expenses were \u00a371 million lower than 2021. Other operating expenses, for the Go-forward group, were \u00a3201 million, or 2.9%, lower than 2021, in line with our cost reduction target of around 3%. The decrease in the year principally reflects property exits, continued focus on customer journeys and strategic efficiency initiatives.\n\nA net impairment charge of \u00a3337 million principally reflects the latest macro-economics, including updated scenarios and their associated weighting. Underlying book performance remains strong, with credit conditions remaining benign and levels of default remaining low. Compared with 2021, our ECL provisions have reduced by \u00a30.4 billion to \u00a33.4 billion, and our ECL coverage ratio has decreased from 1.03% to 0.91%.\n\nThe tax charge for the year includes a \u00a3267 million credit in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses, reflecting an improvement in the outlook when compared with the position at the end of 2021. In addition, the charge also includes a credit of \u00a3135 million in respect of an inflationary uplift in the value of UK Government Index Linked Gilt assets that is not subject to corporation tax.\n\nNet lending increased by \u00a37.3 billion, or 2.0%, in 2022 primarily reflecting \u00a314.4 billion of mortgage lending growth in Retail Banking and \u00a35.7 billion of growth in Commercial & Institutional, partially offset by a \u00a314.6 billion reduction in Central items & other, which included a \u00a36.4 billion decrease as we continued our exit from the Republic of Ireland. Retail Banking gross new mortgage lending for the year was \u00a341.4 billion compared with \u00a336.0 billion in 2021. Within Commercial & Institutional, growth was largely within Corporate & Institutions whilst UK Government Scheme lending reduced by \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nCustomer deposits reduced by \u00a329.5 billion in the year to \u00a3450.3 billion principally reflecting a \u00a314.2 billion reduction in Commercial & Institutional, due to an overall market liquidity contraction in the second half of the year and reduction in Corporate and Institutions, particularly non-operational accounts in Financial Institutions and professional services with relatively low margin and funding value, and a \u00a312.2 billion reduction due to our withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nTNAV per share reduced by 8 pence in the year to 264 pence principally reflecting movements in cash flow hedging reserves of 34 pence per share, dividend payments and other reserve movements partially offset by the attributable profit.\n\n## Capital and leverage\n\nThe CET1 ratio remains robust at 14.2%, or 14.0% excluding IFRS 9 transitional relief. The 170 basis point reduction compared with 1 January 2022 primarily reflected distributions and linked pension accruals of c.310 basis points. Compared with the 1 January 2022 position, RWAs reduced by \u00a30.2 billion as lending growth and model changes were offset by a \u00a35.7 billion reduction in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nWe reached agreement with our pension trustees to restructure the previous agreement to make dividend linked contributions and we will no longer pay \u00a3471 million in 2023. We have agreed to create a trust structure to hold those assets and that gives the pension fund rights to assets in the value of \u00a3471 million in the event a future funding requirement arises based on pre-agreed triggers. These assets will remain on the Group balance sheet in the meantime. We continue to hold the same deduction against capital.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nLCR reduced to 145% during the year driven by a decrease in the liquidity portfolio, primarily reflecting lending growth and reduced customer deposits along with shareholder distributions, and a relatively lower reduction in net outflows.\n\n|                                                                            | Year ended   | Year ended   | Year ended   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                            | 2022         | 2021 (1)     | Variance     |\n| Continuing operations                                                      |              |              |              |\n| Total income                                                               | \u00a313,156m     | \u00a310,429m     | 26.1%        |\n| Total income excluding notable items (2)                                   | \u00a313,061m     | \u00a310,184m     | 28.3%        |\n| Operating expenses                                                         | (\u00a37,687m)    | (\u00a37,758m)    | (0.9%)       |\n| Profit before impairment (losses)/releases                                 | \u00a35,469m      | \u00a32,671m      | 104.8%       |\n| Operating profit before tax                                                | \u00a35,132m      | \u00a33,844m      | 33.5%        |\n| Go-forward group (3)                                                       |              |              |              |\n| Total income excluding notable items (4)                                   | \u00a313,063m     | \u00a310,074m     | 29.7%        |\n| Other operating expenses (4)                                               | (\u00a36,648m)    | (\u00a36,849m)    | (2.9%)       |\n| Performance key metrics and ratios                                         |              |              |              |\n| Bank net interest margin (4,5)                                             | 2.85%        | 2.30%        | 55bps        |\n| Bank average interest earning assets (4,5)                                 | \u00a3345bn       | \u00a3327bn       | 5.5%         |\n| Cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) (4)                       | 55.5%        | 69.9%        | (14.4%)      |\n| Loan impairment rate (4)                                                   | 9bps         | (32bps)      | 41bps        |\n| Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders                               | \u00a33,340m      | \u00a32,950m      | 13.2%        |\n| Total earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders - basic (6) | 33.8p        | 27.3p        | 6.5p         |\n| Return on tangible equity (4)                                              | 12.3%        | 9.4%         | 2.9%         |\n| Lending and deposits                                                       |              |              |              |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost                                        | \u00a3366.3bn     | \u00a3359.0bn     | 2.0%         |\n| Customer deposits                                                          | \u00a3450.3bn     | \u00a3479.8bn     | (6.1%)       |\n| Capital, funding and liquidity                                             |              |              |              |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio (7)                                      | 14.2%        | 18.2%        | (400bps)     |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (7)                                            | \u00a3176.1bn     | \u00a3157.0bn     | \u00a319.1bn      |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)                                             | 145%         | 172%         | (27%)        |\n| Total wholesale funding                                                    | \u00a374.4bn      | \u00a376.7bn      | (\u00a32.3bn)     |\n| Tangible net asset value (TNAV) per ordinary share (8)                     | 264p         | 272p         | (8p)         |\n\nThree legally binding agreements for the sale of the UBIDAC business have been announced as part of the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland: the transfer of performing commercial loans to Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), the sale of performing non-tracker mortgages, performing micro-SME loans, UBIDAC's asset finance business and 25 of its branch locations to Permanent TSB p.l.c Group Holdings p.l.c (PTSB) and an agreement with AIB for the sale of performing tracker and linked mortgages. The business activities relating to these sales that meet the requirements of IFRS 5 are presented as a discontinued operation and as a disposal group on 31 December 2022.

Operating expenses in the Go-forward group, excluding litigation and conduct costs of \u00a3385 million (2021 - \u00a3466 million), were \u00a36,648 million (2021 - \u00a36,849 million). The decrease of \u00a3201 million, or 2.9%, was in line with our cost reduction target of around 3% and principally reflects property exits, continued focus on customer journeys and strategic efficiency initiatives. This has been supported by ongoing strategic investment in key areas, including Data, Technology and Financial Crime.\n- \uf02d Litigation and conduct costs of \u00a3385 million represent the net impact of a number of remediation and litigation matters concluding, including customer due diligence costs paid during the year. Refer to Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on other litigation and conduct matters.\n\n| Impairments - Continuing operations   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 (1) \u00a3m   | Variance \u00a3m   | Variance \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Loans - amortised cost and FVOCI      | 377,153   | 369,827       | 7,326         | 2.0%          |\n| ECL provisions                        | 3,434     | 3,806         | (372)         | (9.8%)        |\n| ECL provisions coverage ratio         | 0.91%     | 1.03%         | (0.12%)       | (11.7%)       |\n| Impairment losses/(releases)          |           |               |               |               |\n| ECL charge/(release) (2)              | 337       | (1,173)       | 1,510         | (128.7%)      |\n| Amounts written off                   | 482       | 876           | (394)         | (45.0%)       |\n\n- (1) Comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain operations as discontinued operations as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n- (2) The table above summarises loans and related credit impairment measured on an IFRS 9 basis. Refer to Credit Risk - Banking activities in the Risk and capital management section for further details.\n\n## 2022 compared with 2021\n\n- \uf02d A net impairment charge of \u00a3337 million principally reflects the latest macro-economics, including updated scenarios and their associated weighting, with more weight being placed on the downside scenario. Underlying book performance remains strong, with credit conditions remaining benign, with levels of default remaining low. Compared with 2021, our ECL provisions have reduced by \u00a30.4 billion to \u00a33.4 billion, and our ECL coverage ratio has decreased from 1.03% to 0.91%. The element of our economic uncertainty post model adjustments (PMA) that relates to COVID-19 risks has been reduced, which, when combined with revisions to our scenario weightings, has allowed us to reduce the amount we hold as economic uncertainty PMA to \u00a30.4 billion, or 10.3% of total impairment provisions.\n\n|                             | 2022    | 2021 (1)   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|------------|\n| Tax - Continuing operations | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m         |\n| Tax charge                  | (1,275) | (996)      |\n| UK corporation tax rate     | 19.0%   | 19.0%      |\n| Effective tax rate          | 24.8%   | 25.9%      |\n\n- (1) Comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain operations as discontinued operations as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2022 compared with 2021\n\n- \uf02d A tax charge of \u00a31,275 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 arises rather than the expected charge of \u00a3975 million based on the corporation tax rate of 19%. The higher tax charge reflects the UK banking surcharge, no tax relief for RoI tax losses, and other non-deductible items. These factors have been partially offset by tax credits in respect of the carrying value of loss DTAs and the RPI uplift on indexed linked gilts. Further details can be found in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n75",

This was primarily driven by decreases in cash and balances at central banks, other financial assets, trading assets and derivative assets partially offset by an increase in loans to customers.\n- \uf02d Cash and balances at central banks decreased by \u00a332.9 billion mainly due to net business segment funding outflows driven by an overall market liquidity contraction, \u00a328.0 billion, movements in FX swaps \u00a38.0 billion and higher levels of debt market activity \u00a34.0 billion partly offset by liquidity management measures, \u00a38.0 billion.\n- \uf02d Other financial assets decreased by \u00a315.3 billion mainly as a result of net Government and Supranational bond trading of \u00a313.5 billion and lower mark-to-market valuations of \u00a31.6 billion on account of higher interest rates.\n- \uf02d Trading assets and trading liabilities reduced by \u00a313.6 billion and \u00a311.8 billion respectively, reflecting the lower trading activity in response to the volatility in key currency rates.\n- \uf02d Derivative assets decreased by \u00a36.6 billion, 6%, to \u00a399.5bn and liabilities decreased by \u00a36.8 billion, 7%, to \u00a394.0 billion. These movements were driven by a decrease in interest rate trading books on account of lower mark-to-market valuations in main currencies partially offset by an increase in exchange rate assets trading book.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n76\n\n- \uf02d Total loans to customers increased by \u00a37.4 billion to \u00a3366.3 billion, primarily reflecting \u00a314.4 billion growth in Retail Banking mortgage business and a \u00a35.7 billion increase in Commercial & Institutional partially offset by a \u00a314.6 billion reduction in Central items & other, which included a \u00a36.4 billion decrease as we continued our exit from the Republic of Ireland.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a329.5 billion principally reflecting a reduction of \u00a314.2 billion in Commercial & Institutional, due to an overall market liquidity contraction in the second half of the year and a \u00a312.2 billion reduction as a result of the withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n- \uf02d Bank deposits decreased by \u00a35.8 billion mainly due to lower repo activity due to market conditions.\n- \uf02d Other financial liabilities, which includes customer deposits at fair value through profit and loss and debt securities in issue, decreased by \u00a30.2 billion, to \u00a349.1 billion.\n- \uf02d Subordinated liabilities have decreased by \u00a32.2 billion, 26%, to \u00a36.3 billion due to redemptions partially offset by new issuances.\n- \uf02d Other liabilities decreased by \u00a30.5 billion, 8%, to \u00a35.3 billion mainly due to a decrease in financial guarantees and accrued lease liabilities.\n- \uf02d Owners' equity decreased by \u00a35.3 billion, 13%, to \u00a336.5 billion, driven by share repurchase, ordinary and paid-in equity dividends paid, partially offset by the attributable profit for the year.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nFinancial review\n\ncontinued\n\n## Segmental summary income statements\n\nTwo changes to reportable segments have been made;\n\nOn 27 January 2022, NatWest Group announced that a new business segment, Commercial & Institutional, would be created, bringing together the Commercial, NatWest Markets and RBSI businesses to form a single business segment, with common management and objectives, to best support our customers across the full non-personal customer lifecycle.\n\nFollowing good progress with respect to the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland, announced in February 2021, Ulster Bank RoI continuing operations are now included in Central items & other.\n\nComparatives have been re-presented.

This was partly offset by a 4.4% headcount reduction as a result of the continued digitalisation, automation and improvement of end-to-end customer journeys.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n79\n\n- \uf02d Impairment losses of \u00a3229 million in 2022 primarily reflect continued low level of stage 3 defaults as well as updated economic outlook scenarios partly offset by provision releases in stage 2. Provision coverage of 0.81% remains strong.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a315.4 billion, or 8.5%, in 2022 mainly reflecting continued mortgage growth of \u00a314.4 billion, with gross new mortgage lending of \u00a341.4 billion representing flow share of around 13%. Cards balances increased by \u00a30.6 billion and personal advances increased by \u00a30.5 billion in 2022 reflecting continued strong customer demand.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a30.5 billion, or 0.3%, in 2022 driven by higher outflows in H2 2022 as customers started to spend following relaxation of Covid-related restrictions and competition for deposit balances increased. Personal savings balances decreased by \u00a30.9 billion partly offset by personal current accounts balance growth of \u00a30.4 billion in 2022.\n- \uf02d RWAs increased by \u00a32.6 billion, or 5.0% versus 1 January 2022 reflecting lending growth and a further increase of 1st January 2022 mortgage regulatory changes of \u00a31.0 billion, partly offset by quality improvements.

At the end of 2022, \u00a36.5 billion of AUM are invested in funds that are on net zero trajectory and are decarbonising at an average rate of 7% per annum.\n- \uf02d Total income of \u00a31,056 million was \u00a3240 million, or 29.4%, higher than 2021 driven by higher deposit and lending balances and improved deposit returns supported by interest rate rises. This represents a particularly strong performance given that Q4 2021 reflected the \u00a354 million consideration from the sale of Adam & Company Investment Management Ltd.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 144 basis points higher than 2021 reflecting higher deposit returns and lending growth. Mortgage book margin was 163 basis points in the year.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a387 million, or 16.6%, higher than 2021 due to continued investment in people and technology to enhance AUMA growth propositions and increased investment in financial crime prevention.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n80\n\n- \uf02d Impairment releases of \u00a32 million in 2022 primarily reflect continued low level of stage 3 defaults and release of post model adjustments, partly offset by a revision of the economic outlook scenario assumptions.\n- \uf02d AUM net new money was \u00a32.0 billion during 2022, which represented 5.6% of opening AUMA balances on an annualised basis, demonstrating a strong performance given volatile investment market conditions. Digital net new money was \u00a30.3 billion, which represented 20.6% of opening Digital AUMA balances. AUMAs decreased by \u00a32.2 billion, or 6.2%, in 2022 primarily reflecting adverse investment market movements of \u00a34.0 billion.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a31.9 billion, or 4.8%, largely driven by strong savings growth, particularly during H1 2022.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a30.8 billion, or 4.3%, in 2022 due to above market mortgage growth of 8%, whilst RWAs decreased by \u00a30.1 billion, or 0.9% driven by capital optimisation initiatives.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nFinancial review\n\ncontinued\n\n## Segment performance continued\n\n## Commercial & Institutional\n\n|                                                  | 2022    | 2021    | Variance   | Variance   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Income statement                                 | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m         | %          |\n| Net interest income                              | 4,171   | 2,974   | 1,197      | 40.2%      |\n| Non-interest income                              | 2,242   | 1,864   | 378        | 20.3%      |\n| Total income                                     | 6,413   | 4,838   | 1,575      | 32.6%      |\n| Other operating expenses                         | (3,563) | (3,646) | 83         | (2.3%)     |\n| Litigation and conduct costs                     | (181)   | (111)   | (70)       | 63.1%      |\n| Operating expenses                               | (3,744) | (3,757) | 13         | (0.3%)     |\n| Impairment (losses)/releases                     | (122)   | 1,160   | (1,282)    | (110.5%)   |\n| Operating profit                                 | 2,547   | 2,241   | 306        | 13.7%      |\n| Performance ratios (1)                           |         |         |            |            |\n| Return on equity                                 | 12.2%   | 10.9%   | 1.3%       |            |\n| Net interest margin                              | 3.31%   | 2.46%   | 0.9%       |            |\n| Cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) | 55.6%   | 75.4%   | (19.8%)    |            |\n| Loan impairment rate                             | 9bps    | (92bps) | 101bps     |            |\n\n- (1) Refer to the Non-IFRS financial measures section for details of basis of preparation and reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures and performance metrics.\n\n|                                                        | 2022   | 2021   | Variance   | Variance   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Capital and balance sheet                              | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn        | %          |\n| Loans to customers (amortised cost)                    |        |        |            |            |\n| - Business Banking                                     | 6.1    | 8.0    | (1.9)      | (23.8%)    |\n| - Commercial Mid-market                                | 71.7   | 72.5   | (0.8)      | (1.1%)     |\n| - Corporate & Institutions                             | 53.7   | 45.4   | 8.3        | 18.3%      |\n| Total loans to customers (amortised cost)              | 131.5  | 125.9  | 5.6        | 4.4%       |\n| Loan impairment provisions                             | (1.6)  | (1.7)  | 0.1        | (5.9%)     |\n| Net loans to customers (amortised cost)                | 129.9  | 124.2  | 5.7        | 4.6%       |\n| Total assets                                           | 404.8  | 425.9  | (21.1)     | (5.0%)     |\n| Funded assets                                          | 306.3  | 321.3  | (15.0)     | (4.7%)     |\n| Customer deposits                                      | 203.3  | 217.5  | (14.2)     | (6.5%)     |\n| Loan:deposit ratio (excl. repos and reverse repos) (1) | 64%    | 57%    | 7.0%       |            |\n| Risk-weighted assets                                   | 103.2  | 98.1   | 5.1        | 5.2%       |\n\n## 2022 compared with 2021\n\n- \uf02d During 2022, Commercial & Institutional delivered a strong performance with a return on equity of 12.2% and an operating profit of \u00a32,547 million.\n- \uf02d Commercial & Institutional provided \u00a320.3 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing in 2022.\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a31,575 million, or 32.6%, higher than 2021 reflecting higher deposit returns from an improved interest rate environment, net loan growth, improved card payment fees and higher markets income.

We also resumed regional stakeholder visits, with a trip to Bristol to meet customers, colleagues, community organisations and suppliers. We heard stakeholders' perspectives first hand and discussed how we can best support them in these challenging times.\n\nDuring a period of significant change in the external environment, the Board was kept regularly informed by management on the impacts of geopolitical and economic developments on the bank and its customers. Reports from our Group CEO and business CEOs included spotlights on the cost-of-living crisis and the continuing situation in Ukraine, and we discussed the actions the bank was taking in response.\n\nStrategy and climate were also high on the Board's agenda. Directors were closely involved in our plans to amplify our purpose-led strategy as described more fully in the Strategic report on pages 40 to 41. Following strong shareholder support for our 'Say on Climate' AGM resolution, the Board continued its close oversight of progress towards our climate ambitions ahead of publication of the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\n\nOn the governance front we conducted an internal Board and Committee evaluation, and further information on the actions we agreed can be found on pages 104 to 105.\n\nThe following pages describe additional 2022 governance highlights, including details of Board and Committee membership changes. Details of the Board's operation and principal areas of focus during 2022 are set out on pages 91 and 94 respectively.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Board members for their contribution, commitment and dedication throughout the year.\n\n## Howard Davies\n\nChairman of the Board 16 February 2023\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nAll directors are committed to observing high standards of corporate governance, integrity and professionalism. Throughout 2022, NatWest Group plc applied the Principles and complied with all of the Provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) with the following exceptions:\n\nProvision 17 - that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions, and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n\nProvision 33 - that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nThe Board considers these are matters that should be reserved for the Board.\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code can be found in this report under the Code's five main section headings:\n\n1 Board leadership and company purpose (page 96)\n\n2 Division of responsibilities (page 100)\n\n3 Composition, succession and evaluation (page 102)\n\n4 Audit, risk and internal control (page 105)\n\n5 Remuneration (page 105)\n\nOur full 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code compliance statement is available on page 168.\n\n## Board and Committee meetings\n\nThere were eight scheduled Board meetings during 2022.\n\nAs well as scheduled meetings, additional ad hoc meetings of the Board and some of its Committees were held throughout the year to receive updates and deal with time-critical matters. There were three additional Board meetings held in 2022 compared to eight additional meetings held in 2021.\n\nWhen directors are unable to attend meetings convened at short notice, they receive the papers and have the opportunity to provide their feedback in advance.\n\nThere were also three strategy sessions with executive management in 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the Chairman and the nonexecutive directors met at least once without executive directors present.\n\n## Board and Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2022\n\n|                      |           |        | Group Audit  Committee (GAC)   | Group Audit  Committee (GAC)   | Group Board Risk  Committee (BRC)   | Group Board Risk  Committee (BRC)   | Group Nominations  and Governance  Committee (N&G)   | Group Nominations  and Governance  Committee (N&G)   | Group Performance  and Remuneration  Committee (RemCo)   | Group Performance  and Remuneration  Committee (RemCo)   | Group Sustainable  Banking Committee  (SBC)   | Group Sustainable  Banking Committee  (SBC)   | Technology and  Innovation  Committee (TIC)   | Technology and  Innovation  Committee (TIC)   |\n|----------------------|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Director             | Scheduled | Ad hoc | Scheduled                      | Ad hoc                         | Scheduled                           | Ad hoc                              | Scheduled                                            | Ad hoc                                               | Scheduled                                                | Ad hoc                                                   | Scheduled                                     | Ad hoc                                        | Scheduled                                     | Ad hoc                                        |\n| Howard Davies        | 8/8       | 3/3    | -

Business reviews from the CEOs of our Retail Banking, Private Banking and Commercial & Institutional businesses included updates on progress against strategy and spotlights on current topics including the cost of living, Ukraine, climate, unsecured lending growth in retail, and mortgages.\n\nIn addition to our business CEOs, a number of other senior executives attended Board meetings throughout the year to present reports to the Board. This provided the Board with an opportunity to engage directly with management on key issues and supported succession planning. The Board also welcomed external presenters and advisers to Board meetings, who provided useful insights and perspectives.\n\nThe Board and Group Executive Committee (ExCo) operating rhythm continues to support a proactive and transparent agenda planning and paper preparation process. This process includes the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 A pre-Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO, Group CFO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary to ensure the Board and executive management are aligned on Board agendas.\n- \u00b7 A post-Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary to discuss what went well or could be improved after each meeting.\n- \u00b7 A look ahead paper at each ExCo and Board meeting setting out key items that will be discussed at the next meeting.\n\nAn overview of the Board's principal areas of focus during 2022, is set out on page 94.",

A common board structure is operated such that the directors of NWH Ltd are also directors of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc) and National Westminster Bank Plc (NWB Plc). Known collectively as the NWH Sub Group, the boards of these three entities meet concurrently.\n\nAn integral part of NatWest Group's governance arrangements is the appointment of three double independent non-executive directors (DINEDs) to the Boards, and Board Committees, of the NWH Sub Group. They are Francesca Barnes, Graham Beale, and Ian Cormack. Abridged biographies for the DINEDs are presented below with more detailed biographies available at natwestgroup.com (NatWest Holdings Limited section).\n\nThe DINEDs are independent in two respects: (i) independent of management as non-executives; and (ii) independent of the rest of NatWest Group by virtue of their NWH Sub Group-only directorships. They attend NatWest Group plc Board and relevant Board Committee meetings as observers.\n\n## Graham Beale\n\nNWH Sub Group - Senior Independent Director and double independent non-executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Date of appointment:\n\n1 May 2018\n\nAs a chartered accountant, Graham brings extensive financial knowledge to the Board alongside his executive management experience, predominantly in retail banking. This enables Graham to provide comprehensive input to Board discussions.\n\nGraham served as Chief Executive Officer of Nationwide Building Society, the UK's largest mutual institution and the world's largest building society from 2007 to 2016.\n\nIn a non-executive capacity, Graham has been a member of the boards of VISA Europe Limited and the British Bankers' Association. He was also Chair and member of the Financial Conduct Authority Practitioners Panel and Chair and a member of the board of the Building Societies Association.\n\n## Francesca Barnes\n\nOur DINEDs play a critical role in NatWest Group's ring-fencing governance structure, and are responsible for exercising appropriate oversight of the independence and effectiveness of the NWH Sub Group's governance arrangements, including the ability of each Board to take decisions independently. When our Commercial & Institutional business was stood up during 2022, the DINEDs considered and provided input on the changes proposed specifically from a ring-fenced bank perspective, ahead of NatWest Group plc and NWH Ltd Board discussions.\n\nThe governance arrangements for the Boards and Board Committees of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group have been designed to enable NatWest Group plc to exercise appropriate oversight and to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, the NWH Sub Group is able to take decisions independently of the wider Group.\n\nThe Group Nominations and Governance Committee monitors the governance arrangements of NatWest Group plc and its subsidiaries and approves appointments to the Boards of principal and material regulated subsidiaries, as described in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee report on page 106.\n\n## Ian Cormack\n\nNWH Sub Group - Double independent non-executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Date of appointment:\n\n1 May 2018\n\nFrancesca brings a wealth of banking and private equity experience to the Board gained through an extensive executive career. Francesca's experience provides considerable knowledge in important areas such as customer experience, risk and stakeholder management.\n\nFrancesca started at Chase Manhattan Bank and went on to hold a number of senior roles within UBS Investment Bank including Global Head of Private Equity; Head of Strategy and Development; Global Loan Portfolio Manager and Chair of the UBSIB Development Board.\n\nFrancesca is currently the Senior Independent Director of HarbourVest Global Private Equity Limited and previously served on the Board of Coutts & Co (2012-2021), a NatWest Group subsidiary.\n\nNWH Sub Group - Double independent non-executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Date of appointment:\n\n1 May 2018\n\nIan's extensive financial services career provides him with significant experience in commercial and investment banking, with particular focus on customer and risk management. This knowledge combined with Ian's understanding of financial infrastructures, strategy and transformation provides invaluable input into Board discussions.\n\nIan spent 30 years with Citibank/Citigroup where he held a number of senior positions, including UK Country Head (CCO), Head of European Training and Co-Head of the Global Financial Institutions Business.\n\nIan is the Senior Independent Director of Just Group plc and has previously held non-executive positions with Phoenix Group Holdings plc, Hastings Group Holdings plc, Bloomsbury Publishing plc and Broadstone Acquisition Corporation Inc.",

        "page_content": "## 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThroughout the year the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code, except in relation to Provisions 17 and 33, as described on page 90 and explained more fully in our statement of compliance on page 168.\n\nIn addition, the Board has delegated two particular aspects of the Code's provisions to Board Committees, with regular updates provided to the Board as appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for reviewing and monitoring NatWest Group's whistleblowing process.\n- \u00b7 The Group Sustainable Banking Committee has delegated responsibility for reviewing key workforce policies and practices (not related to pay) to ensure they are consistent with NatWest Group's values and support long-term sustainable success.\n\nFor further information please refer to the remainder of this report and the relevant Board Committee reports on the following pages.\n\nFurther information on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code is set out here under the Code's five main section headings.\n\n## 1. Board leadership and company purpose\n\n## Role of the Board\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the company, driving both shareholder value and contribution to wider society. The Board's role is to provide leadership of the company within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The Board establishes NatWest Group's purpose, values and strategy and leads the development of NatWest Group's culture. The Board sets the strategic aims of the company and its subsidiaries, ensures that the necessary resources are in place for NatWest Group to meet its objectives, is responsible for the raising and allocation of capital, and reviews business and financial performance. It ensures that the company's obligations to its shareholders and other key stakeholders are understood and met.\n\nThe Board terms of reference include a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board's decision and are reviewed at least annually. They are available at natwestgroup.com. An internal review confirmed the Board had fulfilled its remit as set out in its terms of reference during 2022.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established a number of Board Committees with particular responsibilities. Further details on Board Committee activities during the year can be found in the Board Committee reports. Board Committee terms of reference are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Purpose\n\nIn February 2020 following an extensive period of stakeholder engagement, the Board approved NatWest Group's purpose. Our focus on purpose has strengthened the Board's consideration of the interests of all of our stakeholders and papers presented to the Board set out how they support our purpose. Examples of how purpose has guided Board decisions\n\nand discussions can be found in our section 172 statement on pages 40 to 41.\n\nIn April 2022 the Board received an assessment of progress on embedding purpose and updates on each of the focus areas of enterprise, climate and financial capability/learning. Directors considered the outputs of a colleague opinion survey which had demonstrated good progress on embedding our purpose and values.\n\nThe Board received a further purpose update in December 2022. This included an overview of our evolution to becoming a purpose-led bank, an assessment of progress on embedding our purpose, achievements to date, external perceptions of our progress and future priorities. The directors received a further update on the three focus areas and considered a broader stakeholder overview aligned to the Blueprint for Better Business framework.\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn response to an action arising from the 2021 Board evaluation, a new operating rhythm was introduced for Board engagement and oversight of strategy during 2022. This included more frequent strategy sessions with executive management and interactive sessions informed by stakeholder views, as described below.\n\n## Board oversight and engagement on strategy in 2022\n\n| March Listening  and  reflecting   | The Board considered insights into evolving  customer needs and future trends from a  comprehensive programme of stakeholder  listening.

It uses an integrated  suite of qualitative, quantitative, internal and external data sources to support NatWest Group  in assessing the effectiveness and impact of its culture journey (120 measures in total). These  include customer insights and data (e.g. Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and Competition & Markets  Authority (CMA) survey results), colleague engagement insights (e.g. CAP feedback), Our View  colleague survey insights, risk culture data, audit and behavioural risk data, supplier and  environmental measures, and a range of externally benchmarked ESG data.           |\n|                                                                          | Board culture measurement reports were considered in July and December. These used the  Blueprint for Better Business framework to report progress, highlighting both positive trends and  areas for improvement. In July the Board discussed the report in detail with management and  sought further information across several themes including colleague sentiment amid cost-of- living impacts and financial wellbeing. The December report noted that although there had been  some downward pressure on a number of metrics since the July report - particularly colleague  sentiment and customer measures where the cost-of-living crisis and general economic  conditions were undoubtedly having an impact - the overall picture was relatively stable. |\n| Board business insights packs                                            | Metrics to demonstrate how NatWest Group is delivering for colleagues (including building                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\nThe activities described above have supported the Board in meeting the Code requirement to satisfy itself that the company's purpose, values, strategy and culture are aligned.",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn February 2022, the Board approved its annual objectives and confirmed the Board's key stakeholder groups - customers, investors, regulators, colleagues, communities and suppliers. The Board's agenda and engagement plans were structured to enhance the Board's understanding of stakeholders' views and interests. This in turn has informed Board discussions and decision-making.\n\nThe Chairman also provided regular updates to the Board on meetings with regulators, key stakeholders and other relevant bodies including clients, financial institutions, advisers, and government and media representatives.\n\nThe stakeholder engagement section of the Strategic report on pages 36 to 39 includes some high level examples of how the Board engaged directly with stakeholders, and our section 172 statement on pages 40 to 41 describes how stakeholder interests have been considered in Board discussions and decision-making, including principal decisions.\n\nIn addition to the examples highlighted in the Strategic report, the Board engaged with the views and interests of stakeholders in a variety of other ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Customers : the Group CEO and business CEOs regularly updated the Board on customer engagement activity and sentiment, including CMA and NPS results. An update on customer complaint volumes and key themes arising provided a useful indicator of external sentiment, highlighting key trends in customer complaints and areas of focus for improvement activity.\n- \u00b7 Investors : in addition to engaging directly with institutional investors through quarterly results presentations and 1:1 meetings, the Board also considered investor feedback reports and updates from the Group CFO on external market perspectives, including share price performance and trading activity, which allowed the Board to monitor investor activity. Directors engaged with private shareholders and responded to questions they raised through our virtual shareholder events and at our Annual General Meeting. The Board also held roundtable discussions with three institutional investors, enabling a valuable two-way dialogue on a range of topics including the investors' views of NatWest Group and wider global and economic trends. The Chair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee met with institutional shareholders, UK Government Investments, proxy advisers and the UK regulators to discuss remuneration matters, including wider workforce pay proposals and executive directors' remuneration policy and updated the Board on those discussions. Further details of remuneration engagement can be found in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 138 to 167.\n\n- \u00b7 Regulators : in addition to having PRA and FCA representatives join Board meetings to present the findings of their Periodic Summary Meeting and Firm Evaluation Letter respectively, the Board also reviewed regulatory correspondence and proposed responses. This enabled directors to understand the key matters raised and how management were addressing them. Reports from the Group CEO, Group CFO and business CEOs kept the Board informed on key topics being discussed by management with regulators, enhancing the Board's understanding of regulatory priorities.\n- \u00b7 Colleagues : the Board continued to engage with colleagues through our multi-channel colleague listening approach, further details of which are set out on page 99 under 'Workforce engagement'.\n- \u00b7 Communities : During our regional Board visit to Bristol, the Board met with community groups involved with young people, climate change and supporting ethnic minority businesses, and gained useful insights into the bank's work with those groups. Directors also continued to develop their climate knowledge and expertise, through our annual climate training session and detailed consideration of our Climate transition plan.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers : the Board received regular management updates on key supplier and partnership relationships and initiatives being undertaken with them. Directors also met with suppliers during their visit to Bristol and participated in a dedicated training session on how we are embedding diversity in our supply chain.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nDuring 2022, and in response to one of the actions arising from the 2021 Board evaluation exercise, we reviewed our colleague listening and talent engagement strategy at ExCo and Board levels, including the role of the Colleague Advisory Panel, to ensure it remained fit for purpose.\n\nThe Board agreed to continue its multi-channel approach to colleague engagement at Board level, as described below:\n\n## Our multi-channel colleague listening approach\n\nA number of listening and reporting tools help in promoting colleague voice in the boardroom. This multi-channel approach aims to provide representation from across the bank and guards against the risks of relying on a single source to gather views.\n\n## Colleague surveys and behavioural audits\n\nThe Board and Group Sustainable Banking Committee receive the results of the Our View colleague surveys which provide insight at all levels and aspects of colleague experience.\n\nAnother valuable Board-level source is Behavioural Audit reports from Internal Audit covering sub-culture findings.\n\n## Colleague Advisory Panel\n\nProvides a means by which 'colleague voice' can be strengthened and promoted within the Boardroom.\n\nBoard members engage directly with colleagues on strategic topics. A key outputs report supports discussion at the next scheduled Board meeting.\n\n## Board talent sessions and other direct engagement\n\nDirectors meet with potential executivelevel successors and explore strategic issues with them.\n\nAt 'Meet the Board' events colleagues meet the Chairman, Group CEO and non-executive directors to discuss topical issues.\n\nOther examples of direct engagement include Board Committee visits to Risk and Audit teams, the Chairman meeting with each new graduate intake and internal guest presenters at Board and Committee meetings.\n\n## Board and Committee paper templates\n\nColleagues is one of a number of stakeholder groups included within our governance paper templates.\n\nOur reporting guidance encourages paper authors and sponsors to consider colleague views or impact when presenting reports to our Board and its Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management reporting and activities\n\nBoard-level reporting from the Group CEO and the executive management team includes insights on colleague engagement, wellbeing and development.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "## Our Colleague Advisory Panel\n\nNatWest Group's Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) was set up in 2018 to help promote colleague voices in the boardroom and supports our compliance with Code requirements in relation to Board engagement with the workforce.\n\nThrough the CAP, colleagues can engage directly with the Board on topics which are important to them, thereby strengthening the voice of colleagues in the Boardroom. The CAP is made up of 28 colleagues who are self-nominated or part of an employee representative body. In September 2022 Mike Rogers succeeded Lena Wilson as CAP Chair, and the panel's membership was refreshed. New members received training on the role of the CAP and their responsibilities as members. Although members were randomly selected, we cross-checked to ensure the panel was in the main reflective of the bank's population covering a variety of business areas, organisational levels and locations, working patterns and employee-led networks.\n\nThe CAP met with representatives from the Board twice in 2022 to discuss issues including remuneration (executive pay and the wider workforce), our values, customers in vulnerable situations and future skills. The CAP continues to be highly regarded by those who attend and has proven to be an effective way of establishing two-way dialogue between colleagues and Board members. The Board discusses colleague feedback received from the CAP and the CAP Chair provides feedback on this discussion to the Panel to ensure a continuous feedback loop.\n\n## Further details on NatWest Group's approach to investing in and rewarding its workforce can be found on pages 46 to 47 of the Strategic report.\n\nThe effectiveness of Board stakeholder engagement mechanisms continues to be considered during the annual Board evaluation.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe directors' conflicts of interest policy sets out procedures to ensure that the Board's management of conflicts of interest and its powers for authorising certain conflicts are operating effectively.\n\nEach director is required to notify the Board of any actual or potential situational or transactional conflict of interest and to update the Board with any changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding such conflicts.\n\nSituational conflicts can be authorised by the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the company's Articles of Association. The Board considers each request for authorisation on a case-by-case basis and has the power to impose conditions or limitations on any authorisation granted as part of the process. Details of all directors' conflicts of interest are recorded in a register which is maintained by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and reviewed annually by the Board.\n\n## 2. Division of responsibilities\n\nThe Board has 11 directors comprising the Chairman, two executive directors and eight independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Senior Independent Director.\n\nDirector biographies and details of the Board Committees of which they are members can be found on pages 86 to 89.\n\n## Non-executive director independence\n\nThe Board considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment and that all current non-executive directors are independent for the purposes of the Code.\n\nRobert Gillespie stepped down from the Board on 15 December 2022, having served a full term of nine years. In order that Robert's resignation could coincide with the December Board meeting, he was on the Board for a total of nine years and 14 days. In that respect alone, Mr Gillespie did not meet the independence criteria set out in the Code. Notwithstanding Mr Gillespie's length of service, the Board has determined that Mr Gillespie continued to be independent in character and judgement, offering a strong contribution to Board discussions and debate until he stepped down on 15 December 2022.\n\nOn a similar basis, in February 2023, the Board confirmed that Morten Friis should continue to serve on the Board and be considered as an independent non-executive director until he steps down on 31 July 2023, notwithstanding that he will have served nine years and four months on the Board by that point.\n\n## Chairman and Group CEO\n\nThe role of Chairman is distinct and separate from that of the Group CEO and there is a clear division of responsibilities, with the Chairman leading the Board and the Group CEO managing the business day to day.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThroughout 2022, Mark Seligman, as Senior Independent Director, acted as a sounding board for the Chairman, and as an intermediary for other directors when necessary. He was also available to shareholders to discuss any concerns they may have had, as appropriate.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nAlong with the Chairman and executive directors, the non-executive directors are responsible for ensuring the Board fulfils its responsibilities under its terms of reference.\n\nThe non-executive directors combine broad business and commercial experience with independent and objective judgment. They provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, and specialist advice to the executive directors and the executive management team and hold management to account.\n\nThe balance between non-executive and executive directors enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership across NatWest Group's business activities and ensures no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board's decision-making.\n\nThe Chairman and non-executive directors meet at least once every year without the executive directors present.\n\nDetails of the key responsibilities of the Chairman, Group CEO, Senior Independent Director and non-executive directors are available at natwestgroup.com. In 2022 the Chairman and non-executive directors' role profiles were refreshed and updated to ensure they continue to accurately reflect their role and responsibilities and are in line with best practice.\n\nThe performance of the Chairman and non-executive directors is evaluated annually and further details of the process undertaken can be found on page 105.\n\n## Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary works closely with the Chairman to ensure effective and efficient functioning of the Board and appropriate alignment and information flows between the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board and individual directors on all governance matters, and also facilitates Board induction and directors' professional development.\n\n## Executive management\n\nThe executive management team supports the Group CEO in managing NatWest Group's businesses. The team reviews, challenges and debates relevant items and supports the Group CEO in forming recommendations to the Board. Matters include strategy, financials, capital, risk and operational issues affecting NatWest Group as well as monitoring the implementation of cultural change and executive succession planning. The executive management team actively promotes NatWest Group's culture, values and purpose. Biographies of the executive management team can be found at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Time commitment and external appointments\n\nIt is anticipated that non-executive directors will allocate sufficient time to the company to discharge their responsibilities effectively and will devote such time as is necessary to fulfil their role.\n\nThe Code emphasises the importance of ensuring directors have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. Prior to appointment, significant commitments require to be disclosed with an indication of the time involved. After appointment, external appointments require prior Board approval, with the reasons for permitting significant appointments explained in the Annual Report and Accounts. Board papers relating to proposed additional external appointments of directors include details of the individual's full portfolio for review and consideration. They also include a reminder of applicable Code and Capital Requirements Directive provisions, and relevant proxy adviser and investor guidance.\n\nIn April 2022 Katie Murray joined the Board of Phoenix Group Holdings plc (Phoenix) as a non-executive director. This appointment, and Katie's subsequent appointment as Chair of the Phoenix Group Audit Committee, were both approved by the Board in advance. In reaching its decisions the Board considered both potential conflicts and time commitment and was satisfied that Ms Murray would be able to continue to meet her commitments to NatWest Group.\n\nAt the April 2022 AGM, the resolution to re-elect Frank Dangeard as a director was passed with a lower level of support than expected, particularly from independent shareholders. A proxy adviser had recommended a vote against Mr Dangeard's re-election due to 'over-boarding' under their methodology, although no regulatory limits had been breached. Acknowledging the significant vote against Mr Dangeard's re-election, we explained the situation in our post AGM announcement and re-confirmed the Board's view that Mr Dangeard has sufficient time to undertake his duties with NatWest Group. The Chairman also engaged directly with institutional shareholders, listening and responding to their concerns. Mr Dangeard has since stepped down as Chair of Spear Investments I B.V., where he remains a non-executive director, which will represent a reduction in the number of public company mandates he holds under any voting guidelines where Chair roles are counted as additional commitments.\n\nIn November 2022, the Board approved Roisin Donnelly's appointment as a non-executive director of The Sage Group plc, effective February 2023. The Board considered potential conflicts and the time commitment associated with the additional directorship and, noting that Ms Donnelly expected shortly to resign from the board of HomeServe plc, it was satisfied that Ms Donnelly would continue to have sufficient time to continue to meet her responsibilities to NatWest Group. Ms Donnelly stepped down from HomeServe plc in January 2023.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the commitments of the Chairman and directors and is satisfied that they are able to allocate sufficient time to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.\n\n## Information\n\nAll directors receive accurate, timely and clear information on all relevant matters and have access to the advice and services of the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. In addition, all directors are able, if necessary, to obtain independent professional advice at the company's expense.\n\nOur Board and Committee paper template includes a section for authors to explain how the proposal or update aligns with our purpose and a separate section for them to include an assessment of the relevant stakeholder impacts for the directors to consider. This aligns with the directors' duties under section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 and further details of how the directors have complied with their section 172(1) duties can be found on pages 40 to 41 of the Strategic report.",

This additional page uses the Blueprint for Better Business framework as a base and is aligned to our broader purpose framework.\n\n## Induction and professional development\n\nEach new director receives a formal induction on joining the Board, which is co-ordinated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual concerned. This includes visits to NatWest Group's major businesses and functions, and meetings with directors and senior management. Meetings with external auditors, counsel and stakeholders are also arranged as appropriate.\n\nRoisin Donnelly joined the Board on 1 October 2022 and the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary worked closely with Ms Donnelly to devise a comprehensive induction programme which was tailored to her needs and flexible to respond to areas of focus which emerged as the programme progressed. Priorities included early engagement with key stakeholders, upskilling on the financial services industry and regulation, and developing an understanding of NatWest Group's structure, strategic priorities and business operations.\n\nAll new non-executive directors receive a copy of the NatWest Group non-executive director handbook. The handbook operates as a consolidated governance support manual for directors of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group, providing both new and current directors with a single source of information relevant to their role. It covers a range of topics including NatWest Group's corporate structure; the Board and Board Committee operating model; Board policies and processes; and a range of technical guidance on relevant matters including directors' duties, conflicts of interest, and the UK Senior Managers and Certification Regime. The handbook contains links to a wider library of reference materials via our online resources portal.\n\nDirectors' training and development is co-ordinated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary.\n\nDirectors have access to a wide range of briefing and training sessions and other professional development opportunities. Internal training relevant to the business of NatWest Group is also provided. Directors undertake the training they consider necessary to assist them in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The non-executive directors discuss their training and professional development with the Chairman at least annually.\n\nDuring 2022 our Board training covered supply chain diversity, digital currencies, regulatory updates, the Takeover Code, capital, financial crime, inside information, climate, ring-fencing rules and a cyber risk 'war game'.\n\nIn addition, directors broadened their knowledge and understanding of the risks facing NatWest Group by participating in a Board dinner discussion with executive management on principal and emerging risks. A number of directors also accepted an invitation to the full Board to join meetings of the Technology and Innovation Committee which covered areas of broader interest, including a session on data strategy.\n\n## 3. Composition, succession and evaluation Composition\n\nThe Board is structured to ensure that the directors provide NatWest Group plc with the appropriate combination of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity, as well as independence.\n\nIn December 2022 the Group Nominations and Governance Committee reviewed, and the Board approved, an updated version of our Board skills matrix, a summary view of which is set out on page 93.\n\nThe Board skills matrix reflects directors' self-assessment of the skills and experience they bring to Board discussions, in line with pre-determined criteria aligned to current and future strategic priorities.\n\nBoard Committees also comprise directors with a variety of skills and experience so that no undue reliance is placed on any one individual.\n\nThe boardroom inclusion policy aims to promote diversity and inclusion in the composition of the Boards of directors of NatWest Group plc, NWH Ltd, NWB Plc and RBS plc and in the nominations and appointments process. This policy reflects NatWest Group's values, its inclusion guidelines and relevant legal or voluntary code requirements.\n\nThe policy includes measurable objectives which exist to ensure that the Boards, and any Committees they delegate nominations responsibilities to, follow an inclusive process when making decisions on nominations and appointments. The policy includes targets which aspire to meet those set out in the UK Listing Rules along with the recommendations of the FTSE Women Leaders Review and the Parker Review. The policy also acknowledges NatWest Group's ambition to have gender balance in our global top three levels (CEO-3 and above) by 2030.\n\nThroughout 2022 the Board met the recommendation of the Parker Review with at least one director from an ethnic minority background and it intends to continue to meet that recommendation.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 45% of the Board were female, which exceeded the FTSE Women Leaders Review target of 40% female representation by the end of 2025; and\n- \u00b7 with a female Group CEO and Group CFO, we also met the FTSE Women Leaders Review recommendation that companies should have at least one woman in the Chair or Senior Independent Director roles on the Board and/or one woman in the Chief Executive Officer or Finance Director role by the end of 2025.\n\nA copy of the boardroom inclusion policy is available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Succession\n\nAs set out in its terms of reference the Board is responsible for ensuring adequate succession planning for the Board and senior management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience within NatWest Group and on the Board.\n\nIn June 2022 the Board received an update on executive talent and succession planning which enabled directors to monitor the internal talent pipeline and provide feedback. This update included analysis of the diversity of the talent pool, with a view towards continuing to improve diversity over the longer term.\n\nIn October 2022 the Board held a talent engagement session with potential ExCo successors. This session helped our non-executive directors gain insights into the breadth of the talent pool, getting to know the individuals through a focused discussion on our values and how they are embedding across the bank.\n\nBoard succession planning has also been an important area of focus in 2022.\n\nThe Group Nominations and Governance Committee supports the Board on Board succession planning, including making recommendations to the Board on Board appointments and Board Committee membership.\n\nIn June 2022 (following review and recommendation by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee), the Board approved succession plans for the roles of Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs, covering orderly transition plans for the short and medium term, and contingency arrangements which could be implemented in case of an emergency. These succession plans are reviewed by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee and approved by the Board at least once a year.\n\nOn 24 September 2022, the Board approved Lena Wilson's appointment as Chair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee, succeeding Robert Gillespie who had confirmed his intention to resign as a director on 15 December 2022.\n\nOn 1 October 2022, Roisin Donnelly was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director. And on 16 December 2022, we announced that Stuart Lewis will join the Board as an independent non-executive director on 1 April 2023. Subject to regulatory approval, Mr Lewis will succeed Morten Friis as Chair of the Group Board Risk Committee on 1 August 2023.\n\nOn 16 December 2022 we announced that Mr Friis had confirmed his intention to resign as a non-executive director on 31 July 2023, and on 31 January 2023 we announced that Mike Rogers would be stepping down from the Board on 25 April 2023.\n\nFurther information on the role of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee and its activities during 2022 can be found in the Committee Chair's report on pages 106 to 107.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Code, all directors will stand for election or re-election by shareholders at the company's AGM, with the exception of Mr Rogers, who has confirmed his intention to resign on 25 April 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors also requires approval by a majority of independent shareholders.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Code, an evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman and individual directors takes place annually. The evaluation is externally facilitated every three years, with internal evaluations in the intervening years.\n\nAn internal evaluation was conducted in 2022 by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, following the externally facilitated evaluation led by Independent Board Evaluation in 2021. Further details on how the 2022 evaluation was conducted and the outcomes and actions arising from that process are set out in this section.",

Directors engaged fully with the evaluation exercise and commented positively in relation to many aspects of the Board's operations.\n\nThe evaluation findings noted that overall sentiment was good and there was a real sense of the Board and executive management working well together to drive the business forward. Purpose was strong and was evident in decision-making and the revised approach to strategy had worked well. Setting Board objectives in 2022 was considered helpful in directing focus and there had been good oversight of priorities and outcomes.\n\nOverall, the directors felt the Board's size was about right and succession planning had been handled well. The culture of the Board had continued to develop positively, although the dynamic could be further improved. The balance of responsibilities between the Board and Committees was appropriate, but Committee reporting to the Board could be sharper.\n\nDirector feedback on the Board calendar, time commitment and stakeholder visits were all positive. Directors reiterated that agendas should ensure key issues are prioritised and that papers should not be too long. Board training was considered good and directors appreciated the strong support from the corporate governance team.\n\nIn December 2022 the Board agreed a detailed action plan in response to the recommendations set out in the internal Board evaluation report, which included the following:\n\n| Theme                                       |     | 2023 actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose and  strategy                       | \u00b7 \u00b7 | Include an annual review of purpose embedding at the Board.

Explore opportunities for the Board to meet in/visit regional hubs. |\n\nImplementation of the 2022 Board evaluation action plan will be overseen by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee during 2023.\n\n## 2022 Board Committee evaluations - outcomes and actions\n\nDetails of the outcomes of the 2022 Board Committee evaluations can be found in the relevant Committee Chair reports. Progress against these actions will be tracked at Committee level during 2023.\n\n## 2022 Individual director and Chairman effectiveness reviews\n\nThe Chairman met each director individually to discuss their own performance and continuing professional development and establish whether each director continues to contribute effectively to the company's long-term sustainable success. The Chairman also shared peer feedback provided by directors during the evaluation. Separately, the Senior Independent Director, together with the Senior Independent Director of the ring-fenced bank, sought feedback on the Chairman's performance from the non-executive directors, executive directors and other key internal and external stakeholders and discussed it with the Chairman. This included peer feedback provided by directors during the evaluation.\n\n## 4. Audit, risk & internal control\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions set out in this section of the Code can be found throughout the Annual Report and Accounts. The following sections are of particular relevance:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group Audit Committee report (page 108) which describes the completion of an external audit tender and sets out the process undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of both the Internal Audit function and the external auditors and the principal findings thereof. It also explains the approach taken to ensuring the integrity of financial and narrative statements and confirms that it supports the Board in the\n\nassessment of NatWest Group's disclosures to be fair, balanced and understandable;\n\n- \u00b7 the viability statement (page 68) which details how the Board has assessed the future prospects of NatWest Group plc and the ways in which risks are considered and managed in order to achieve its strategic objectives;\n- \u00b7 the Compliance report (page 168), which explains the internal control framework in place and how the Board monitors and reviews the company's risk management and internal control systems; and\n- \u00b7 the Group Board Risk Committee report (page 117) which explains how the Board oversees the principal and emerging risks facing NatWest Group and how management addresses these.\n\nThe Board regularly assesses the company's emerging and principal risks in a variety of ways including through consideration of the risk management report. Details of the company's principal risks, procedures in place to identify Top and Emerging Threats, and how these are being managed or mitigated, can be found on pages 64 to 67 (Risk overview) and pages 176 to 283 (Risk and Capital Management).\n\n## 5. Remuneration\n\nThe Directors' remuneration report on pages 138 to 167 provides information on the activities of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee, the decisions taken on remuneration during the year and why the Committee believes these are the right outcomes in the circumstances. The report also details how the remuneration policy for executive directors supports the delivery of the company's strategic goals and purpose, with significant delivery in shares to provide long-term alignment with shareholders. Information is also included on wider workforce remuneration including our approach to providing fair pay.",

In addition, the Committee monitors NatWest Group's governance arrangements to ensure that the best corporate governance standards and practices are upheld and considers developments relating to banking reform and analogous issues affecting NatWest Group. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any consequential amendments to NatWest Group's operating model.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually, approved by the Board and are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Principal activity during 2022\n\nThe Committee supports the Chair in keeping the composition of the Board and its Committees under regular review. The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board a skills matrix which is used to map the skills and experience of individual directors and ensure that the Board's collective skill-set remains appropriately balanced and aligned to current and future strategic priorities. The matrix is also used to identify any gaps and opportunities to enhance the collective balance of skills through additional recruitment to the Board.\n\nFollowing the Committee's review of the skills matrix and noting the tenure of a number of non-executive directors, the Committee supported implementation of the Board's succession plans by overseeing the search for two new non-executive directors during 2022.\n\nA subset of the Board's membership selected Audeliss to support a comprehensive candidate search with diversity and inclusion considerations at the forefront of the search criteria. The Committee held a number of discussions on potential candidates as the search progressed, assessing the credentials of each candidate against the qualities and capabilities set out in the role specification agreed by the Committee. Following a formal, rigorous and transparent process the Committee recommended two candidates to the Board for appointment.\n\nOn 1 October 2022 Roisin Donnelly was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director. On 16 December 2022 NatWest Group announced that Morten Friis intends to stand down from the Board with effect from the close of business on 31 July 2023, shortly after reaching the ninth anniversary of his appointment. At the same time, it was announced that Stuart Lewis would join the Board as a non-executive director and member of the Group Board Risk Committee on 1 April 2023. Subject to regulatory approval, Stuart will be appointed as Chair of the Group Board Risk Committee on 1 August 2023. Both Roisin and Stuart bring extensive skills and experience to their roles and the Board looks forward to benefitting from their valuable and important contributions.\n\nDuring 2022 the Committee also reviewed the contribution of a number of serving Board members under the board appointment policy which sees non-executive directors appointed for an initial three-year term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Following assessment by the Committee, they may then be appointed for a further threeyear term. Non-executive directors may continue to serve beyond six years, subject to a maximum tenure of nine years. The tenures of the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out on page 93.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the structure, size and composition of the NatWest Group plc Board, the Committee has also continued to oversee work aimed at further enhancing NatWest Group's subsidiary governance framework. A number of our material regulated subsidiaries made appointments to their boards during 2022, which the Committee has overseen. Spencer Stuart and Green Park have both been engaged during the year to support NatWest Group's subsidiary board search activity. The firms are members of the retained executive search panel of suppliers (managed by NatWest Executive Search). Spencer Stuart also provide leadership advisory and senior executive search and assessment services to the People & Transformation function within NatWest Group.\n\nDuring the year the Committee continued to monitor NatWest Group's governance arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate by reference to best practices in corporate governance (having regard to relevant legislation, guidelines, industry practice and developments affecting NatWest Group in the markets where it operates).\n\nDuring 2022 the Committee considered a number of external policy developments and the impacts on NatWest Group's corporate governance framework, including changes to the Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules introduced following the FCA's review of diversity and inclusion on company boards and executive committees.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nThroughout the majority of 2022 the Committee comprised the Chairman of the Board and four independent non-executive directors. Lena Wilson joined the Committee on 24 September 2022, when she succeeded Robert Gillespie as Chair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee. Robert remained a member of the Committee until he stood down from the Board on 15 December 2022. Graham Beale also observes meetings of the Committee in his capacity as Senior Independent Director of NWH Ltd and member of the NWH Ltd Nominations Committee. The Committee holds a minimum of four meetings per year and meets on an ad hoc basis as required. In 2022, there were four meetings. Individual attendance by directors at these meetings is shown in the table on page 91.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe 2022 review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees was conducted internally in 2022 by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. The Committee has considered and discussed the outcomes of the evaluation and accepts the findings, more information on which can be found on page 104. Overall, the review concluded that the Committee's responsibilities had been discharged effectively with no material recommendations being identified for action. The Committee will continue to ensure that the full Board is appropriately sighted on the work of the Committee, including Board succession planning that will continue to be a key priority for the Committee during 2023.\n\nThe outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress during the year.\n\n## Boardroom inclusion policy\n\nAs noted on pages 93 and 102, the Board operates a boardroom inclusion policy which reflects NatWest Group's values, its inclusion guidelines and relevant legal or voluntary code requirements. The policy currently applies to the most senior NatWest Group boards: NatWest Group plc, NWH Ltd, NWB Plc and RBS plc. A copy of the boardroom inclusion policy is available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Objectives and targets\n\nThe boardroom inclusion policy's objectives ensure that the Board, and any Committee to which it delegates nomination responsibilities, follows an inclusive process when making nomination decisions. That includes ensuring that the nomination process is based on the principles of fairness, respect and inclusion, that all nominations and appointments are made on the basis of individual competence, skills and expertise measured against identified objective criteria and that searches for Board candidates are conducted with due regard to the benefits of diversity and inclusion.\n\nPage 168 confirms NatWest Group's approach to Provision 17 of the Code which sees oversight of succession plans for senior management positions and the development of a diverse pipeline for succession reserved as a matter for the full Board. Pages 48 to 49 contain more information on how NatWest Group is creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, including (in relation to Provision 23 of the Code) the gender balance of senior management and their direct reports.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nThroughout 2022 the Board met the recommendation of the Parker Review with at least one member of the Board being of an ethnic minority background and it intends to continue to meet that recommendation.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the Board exceeded the FTSE Women Leaders Review target of 40% female Board representation by the end of 2025, with 45% of the Board being female.\n\nDiversity and inclusion progress, including information about the appointment process, will continue to be reported in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee's report in the NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity on the Board, and how the Board operates together as a unit, is reviewed annually as part of the Board evaluation. Where appropriate, findings from the evaluation will be considered in the search, nomination and appointment process.\n\n## Howard Davies\n\nChair of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee 16 February 2023",

It has been another busy year and I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their contributions, in particular Robert Gillespie who stood down from the Committee at the end of the year. The Committee also appreciated the views of Graham Beale and Ian Cormack, who are non-executive directors and Audit Committee members of NatWest Holdings and attend GAC meetings in an observational capacity.\n\nThe Committee's primary purpose is to oversee and challenge management's approach to the preparation of financial results and relevant non-financial disclosures. This includes considering existing and new accounting policies, scrutinising standards of internal control and their efficacy and reviewing the disclosures each quarter prior to release. More detail on the remit of the Committee can be found in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\nInterrogating the quarterly releases of financial and relevant non-financial information continued to be a priority for the GAC in 2022. This included consideration of relevant reports from management on the judgements applied during the preparation of the information and legal and regulatory developments.\n\nConsideration was also given to management's assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting and how those controls might be developed and also applied to other areas of NatWest Group's activities. The Committee also received reports from the internal audit function on the internal control environment and the external auditors on internal controls over financial reporting and key accounting and judgemental matters.\n\nAs the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic continued during 2022, it was evident that new macroeconomic challenges were emerging, including the rising cost of living and supply chain issues. As such the Committee agreed with management that post model adjustments to expected credit losses would be required throughout the year although the composition evolved during that time.\n\nA major focus of the Committee and management in 2022 was the tender for the external audit. Detailed consideration was given to the timing of this process, and it was determined appropriate to accelerate it to ensure a competitive process and provide management with clarity for potential consultancy engagements. Following consideration of the responses received, and presentations from the responding firms to management and to the Committee, the appointment of PwC as auditors of NatWest Group from 2026 was recommended to the Board. Further details can be found on page 109. The Committee has been satisfied with the performance of the current auditors, EY, throughout the firm's tenure.\n\nI have continued to fulfil the role of whistleblowers' champion for NatWest Group, receiving regular updates on the efficacy of the whistleblowing framework, themes in reports made by colleagues via the systems and monitoring the outcomes of the most pertinent cases. The Committee continued to hold responsibility for oversight of the independence, autonomy and effectiveness of NatWest Group's whistleblowing policies and procedures. It is pleasing that colleague awareness of how to raise concerns remained high in 2022. A refreshed communications campaign during the year linked to NatWest Group's new values and purpose further helped to embed a culture where colleagues feel able to raise any concerns via the whistleblowing framework.\n\n## Membership\n\nFull biographical details of the members of the Committee during 2022 are set out on pages 86 to 89. The members are all independent non-executive directors who also sit on other Board committees in addition to the GAC (as set out in their biographies). This common membership helps facilitate effective governance across all finance, risk and remuneration matters and ensures that agendas are aligned, and duplication of responsibilities is avoided.\n\nMembers of the GAC are selected with a view to the expertise and experience of the Committee as a whole and with proper regard to the key issues and challenges facing NatWest Group. As NatWest Group plc is a listed company on the London and New York stock exchanges it has certain obligations as to the expertise and qualifications of the Group Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that all GAC members have recent and relevant financial experience and are independent as defined in the SEC rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'Exchange Act') and related guidance. The Board has further determined that Patrick Flynn, Mark Seligman and, during his tenure as a member of the Committee, Robert Gillespie are all 'financial experts' for the purposes of compliance with the Exchange Act Rules and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and that they have competence in accounting and/or auditing as required under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\n## Meetings and visits\n\nFive scheduled meetings of the Committee were held in 2022, four of which took place immediately prior to the release of the financial results each quarter. One ad hoc meeting was also held, to consider management's preliminary assessment of half-year out-turn on expected credit losses at H1 2022. During the year all members attended the meetings, the majority of which were held in person. All meetings were also attended, in an observational capacity, by the two non-executive directors of NatWest Holdings who are members of that entity's Audit Committee.\n\nIn conjunction with the Group and NWH Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the NWH Audit Committee, the GAC undertook its annual programme of visits to control functions. Constructive and insightful discussions were held with members of management from the Risk, Internal Audit and Finance teams.\n\n## Performance evaluations\n\nIn 2022 the annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees, including the GAC, was conducted internally by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. It was determined that the GAC had continued to operate effectively during 2022, meeting its statutory duties. The outcomes of the evaluation were considered by the Committee and subsequently reported to the Board. The key area for focus related to improved discipline on the papers presented to the Committee. The GAC will monitor progress during 2023. The Committee is satisfied it fulfilled its terms of reference throughout the year.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor the performance of the external auditor and the Internal Audit function in 2022. Formal assessments were undertaken at the end of the year via an internal process and the Committee reviewed summaries of the feedback provided by relevant stakeholders. Progress made to address the recommendations of the previous year's evaluations was welcomed.\n\n## Patrick Flynn\n\nChair of the Group Audit Committee 16 February 2023\n\n## External audit tender\n\nOur objective was to run a competitive audit tender through a process that is fair and transparent for those firms participating with minimal disruption to NWG during this period.\n\n- \u00b7 April 2022 - discussed the benefits and disadvantages of accelerating the timescales for the external audit tender, which would be required to be undertaken by 2024 at the latest. Further information was requested on the potential participants, the impact on existing and planned consultancy work, and the proposed selection criteria used in a tender.\n- \u00b7 June 2022 - it was agreed that the audit tender process should be accelerated to ensure the best availability of firms able to respond. The market was informed of the decision to commence the process, in line with regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 June 2022 - the process commenced with firms invited to participate in the tender; three statements of intent were received from firms with one firm unable to provide a team which would meet NatWest Group's requirements.\n- \u00b7 July/August 2022 - management supported the supplier evaluation, capability and independence assessments, interviews held with key members of management, and deep dives into specific areas of capability.\n- \u00b7 Mid-September 2022 - management panel sessions held.\n- \u00b7 End of September 2022 - final presentations by firms to GAC members. The Committee then deliberated on its recommendation to the Board\n- \u00b7 October 2022 - Key factors in assessing firms included: the understanding of NatWest Group; the quality of the engagement team; the capability of the firm, with a focus on data and digitisation capabilities; the quality of the audit approach; the availability to the engagement team of suitable global resources to meet NatWest Group's requirements; independence; and value add. Having considered the scoring criteria, key factors, input and observations from the Committee and from the presentations themselves, the Committee recommended to the Board that PwC be appointed as NatWest Group's External Auditor for the financial period ending 31 December 2026, subject to shareholder approval.",

        "page_content": "## Financial and non-financial reporting\n\nThe GAC considered a number of accounting judgements and reporting issues in the preparation of NatWest Group's financial results throughout 2022. The Committee reviewed the quarterly, interim and full year results announcements, the annual reporting suite of documents and other principal financial and non-financial releases for recommendation to the Board for approval. This included the disclosures required by the TCFD and the ESG Disclosures Report. Consideration was given to the controls surrounding the preparation of these releases.\n\n| Matter                   | Role of Committee and context  of discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | How the Committee addressed the matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Expected  credit losses  | To review and challenge  management's judgements in  relation to credit impairments  and the underlying assumptions,  methodologies and models  applied, and any post-model  adjustments required. To  also consider the impact of  macro-economic risks on  the credit environment | The GAC focused on the key assumptions, methodologies and post-model  adjustments applied to provisions under IFRS 9. While economic  uncertainty persisted in 2022, the causes pivoted from the post-pandemic  recovery to rising inflation and cost of living. As the macro-economic  environment developed during the year it was clear that it would not  be possible to adopt a net release of IFRS 9 provisions in the year. The  provisions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic were replaced by those  of a similar quantum for economic uncertainty. This was considered to  be the most appropriate course of action given the uncertainty, and an  environment of rising interest rates not experienced in recent times. |\n| Treatment  of goodwill   | To consider the treatment of  goodwill throughout the year  and ensure the carrying value  was appropriate and suitable  disclosures were made.                                                                                                                                     | The Committee supported management's view that it was not necessary  to undertake an out of cycle reassessment of goodwill during 2022.  Following discussion and challenge, the Committee was satisfied that  goodwill remained recoverable throughout the year, and that appropriate  disclosures were included in the financial releases. Goodwill was retired  as a significant accounting judgement at the end of 2022 as a result  of improved projections which result in an impairment being  considered unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Valuation  methodologies | To consider valuation  methodologies, assumptions  and judgements made  by management.                                                                                                                                                                                              | The GAC considered valuation methodologies and assumptions for financial  instruments carried at fair value and scrutinised judgements made by  management on a quarterly basis throughout 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n| Matter                                                            | Role of Committee and context  of discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | How the Committee addressed the matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provisions and  disclosures                                       | To consider the level of  provisions for regulatory,  litigation and conduct issues  throughout the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The Committee reviewed the levels of provisions during the year  for regulatory, litigation and conduct matters, and was satisfied these  were appropriate.

The Committee considered whether the annual,  interim and quarterly disclosures met the UK Corporate Governance Code  requirements to be 'fair, balanced and understandable'. It concluded each  time that the releases satisfied the necessary criteria. The external auditor  also considered the fair, balanced and understandable statement as part  of the year-end processes and supported NatWest Group's position. |\n| Climate-related  Disclosures  Report and ESG  Disclosures  Report | To review the principal non- financial disclosures made by  NatWest Group and to ensure  appropriate controls are in place  to support the preparation of the  information. These disclosures  include the annual Climate- related Disclosures Report and  the ESG Disclosures Report.                                                                                                           | The Committee remained focused on the controls which support the  non-financial disclosures to ensure that they remained appropriate and  robust. The GAC noted that the controls were aligned with the controls  in place for financial disclosures. The GAC discussed and provided feedback on both the Climate related  disclosures report, which incorporated climate transition plan information,  and the ESG Disclosures Report for 2022. A significant area of discussion  related to NatWest Group's dependency on external factors in order to  achieve its Climate ambition and how this aligned to best practice disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                               |",

Simultaneously the impact classification  matrix was revised in line with current risk appetite. The reliance on  manual processes and controls was a significant cause of events in 2022,  which the Committee noted with concern. The work to introduce greater  automation into the bank's key processes is ongoing and the Committee  encouraged this to be completed promptly.

In carrying out this important role, the Committee helps to ensure that NatWest Group is purpose-led in its decision-making, building long-term value in the business. More detail on the remit of the Committee can also be found in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and available at natwestgroup.com.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee ensured its time was prioritised to focus on oversight of NatWest Group's principal and emerging risks. Financial crime has remained a key area of focus and the Committee has been pleased to see significant progress towards a return to appetite. Other areas of focus have included model risk remediation activity; oversight of implementation of risk management framework improvements, particularly the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) roll-out; oversight of the effectiveness review of the Risk function, which included the evolution of the risk management strategy; and a wide range of operational risk matters.

Emerging priorities during the year included Consumer Duty requirements, data, cloud hosting risk and payments technology and architecture. Additionally with the volatile geopolitical and economic environment, BRC devoted significant time to the impact of the external economic environment on NatWest Group's risk profile. It is expected that these will continue to be areas of focus in 2023 as NatWest Group drives towards return to appetite in a number of areas, implements changes to meet regulatory expectations, and continues to respond to the external economic environment and cost of living pressures.\n\nFurther information on key topics considered during the year and areas of focus and challenge by the Committee is provided on the following pages.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their continued commitment, support and challenge during what has been an unpredictable and eventful year, and throughout my tenure as BRC Chair.\n\n## Morten Friis\n\nChair of the Group Board Risk Committee 16 February 2023\n\n## Membership\n\nBRC comprises four independent non-executive directors. The details of the members and their skills and experience are set out on pages 86 to 89. Robert Gillespie stepped down as a member of the Committee when he stepped down from the Board on 15 December 2022. I would like to thank Robert for his long-standing commitment and contribution to the Committee.\n\nPatrick Flynn is chair of the Group Audit Committee of which I am also a member. Lena Wilson is chair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee (RemCo). This common membership helps to ensure effective governance across the committees.\n\nRegular attendees at BRC meetings include: the Group Chairman, Group CEO, Group CFO, Group CRO, Group Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, Group Chief Audit Executive, and the External Auditor. External advice is sought by the Committee where appropriate.\n\nFrancesca Barnes joined NWH Ltd's BRC in September 2022.

Six of the eight meetings were held in person, with the remaining two meetings held virtually during the year. Details of meeting attendance can be found on page 91.\n\nOutside formal meetings, the Committee met with the Risk Leadership Team and held additional sessions to consider improvements to the risk management report and the development of the risk management strategy. Dinners were arranged to discuss the Retail strategy from a risk perspective and to consider the operation of the Committee. Members of the Group and the NWH Ltd BRCs also undertook a programme of visits to the Risk, Internal Audit and Finance functions, in conjunction with members of the Group and the NWH Ltd Audit Committees.\n\n## Performance Evaluation\n\nThroughout the year the Committee acted in accordance with its terms of reference. The annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees, including BRC, was conducted internally in 2022. The PRA also conducted a review of the BRC.\n\nThe Committee held a dedicated session to discuss its performance. The session was structured around a number of themes: focus and priorities; reporting and operating rhythm; committee effectiveness and culture and dynamics. The Committee agreed that it was operating effectively and believed it discussed all principal and emerging risks and challenged management appropriately. The Committee suggested that there needed to be continued focus on prioritising agendas to try to reduce the volume of papers and to allow sufficient time for discussion. Continued improvement in the quality of papers and timeliness of data presented to the Committee was also desired. These will be areas of focus for 2023.\n\n## Principal areas of Board Risk Committee focus in 2022\n\nThe table below describes the Board Risk Committee's principal areas of focus in 2022, alongside key outcomes and stakeholders considered.\n\n| Theme           | Principal areas of Board Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial crime | Committee focus  Oversight of the management  and return to appetite of  financial crime risk, which  continues to be a principal  risk for NatWest Group.

A spotlight on conduct  and regulatory compliance | The Committee supported the Board in overseeing management's  progress in addressing Consumer Duty requirements through detailed  review of the implementation plan prior to approval by the Board. It was  acknowledged that timelines were challenging and there was significant  work to do during 2023. To ensure progress was being monitored, the  Committee requested a detailed milestone plan to implementation which it  was agreed it would track closely. The Committee also sought assurance  from management on appropriate funding and resource.

It received  regular updates on NatWest  Group's operational risk profile  and risk appetite, with a  particular focus on operational  resilience, manual controls and  information and cybersecurity. The annual spotlight on  operational risk considered  improvements made to the  operational risk framework  and oversight of change risk. The Committee considered  the operational resilience  self-assessment (*)  in detail prior  to approval by the Board, with  Given the number of operational risk related incidents and regulatory  focus, the Committee requested additional detailed updates on operational  risk performance and trends. The information and cybersecurity spotlight included consideration of any  increased threat from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally,  BRC received updates on the results of a full scan of NatWest Group's  data centres and remediation activity carried out on Log4J vulnerabilities. The Committee requested a further update in respect of end of life  systems and received assurance from management on the risk posed  to NatWest Group, the sufficiency of investment, and how it compared  to peers. Manual controls are a key area of concern for the Committee and the  Committee requested an update on the management of manual controls  and actions to reduce the number of manual controls was provided.  The Committee will continue to receive information on the elimination  of manual controls and drive to automation and requested that updates  be included in every risk management report. |",

Changes to the Risk Data Aggregation &  Reporting Framework were reviewed and approved by the Committee  under Board delegated authority. The Committee continues to have concerns on the timeliness and  accuracy of some data and requested sight of plans to improve the  risk reporting processes, particularly through the Risk and Finance Data  Transformation Programme. The Committee asked to see regular updates  on progress against programme milestones. An update on the programme  was discussed at a joint BRC/GAC visit to Finance in December 2022 and  will continue to be an area of focus. |\n| Outsourcing  and third  party risk  management | BRC maintained oversight of  NatWest Group's outsourcing  and third party risk management  to facilitate oversight of the  identification and management  of third-party related risks.

Further spotlights\n\nwere considered in respect of\n\ntraded and non-traded\n\nmarket risk.\n\nOutcomes\n\nCredit and market risk - These updates provided insight into the sources of the risk, including asset quality, risk management approach and risk appetite, controls as well as testing and monitoring activity undertaken. The Committee challenged whether the level of the BRC's oversight of traded market risk was appropriate and whether capabilities were comparable to peers. This resulted in traded market risk stress limits being revised and external insight from EY being provided. The Committee also questioned management on the measures being put in place to support customers in difficulties due to the cost of living crisis, including problem debt preparedness and monitoring for signs of stress. The Committee received regular status updates and assurances from management that a pro-active approach was being taken across NatWest Group and that there were sufficient resource levels in the customer services teams.\n\nICAAPs, ILAAPs and Budget and Risk Appetite Stress Tests (*) - The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the scenarios to be used during 2023 for the budget process, IFRS9 management and for the monitoring of the risk profile relative to the approved Risk Appetite. BRC considered the budget and budget stress test as well as the ILAAP and ICAAP for the NatWest Group and recommended them to Board for approval. It supported Risk and Internal Audit improvement recommendations which will be incorporated in 2023 submissions.\n\nCapital distributions - The Committee provided detailed review of proposals to increase capital distributions to shareholders prior to approval by the Board, including an in-market buy-back and payment of a special dividend with consolidation features, following the improved projected capital position of NatWest Group. The Committee reviewed and recommended initial proposals for year-end capital distributions to the Board ahead of final approval in February 2023.\n\nThe Committee challenged management on the appropriateness of reducing the level of capital held above regulatory supervisory levels, the manner in which capital would be deployed over the plan, and the level of anticipated future capital distribution. The Committee recommended the Capital Management Enhancement Plan to the Board for approval and had oversight of its delivery which would be required to support 2022 year-end capital distributions.\n\nClimate risk - The Committee considered the Climate Biennial Stress Test Results Round 2 (*) (CBES 2) in detail prior to Board approval. Following the embedding of climate risk into the existing EWRMF, BRC received a spotlight on climate risk which considered the status of franchises and functions against maturity plans and embedding of the Climate Risk framework together with feedback from the PRA on CBES2. The continued challenge to achieving NatWest Group's climate ambition and maintaining its position versus peers was discussed.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS",

BRC also monitors and  challenges the development  of plans which would allow  NatWest Group to be dealt  with effectively in the event  of financial failure. | Stress testing scenario -  Stress testing scenarios used to monitor and  measure risk profile have been kept under close review by the Committee  given the significant changes to the external environment and the  importance of capturing the range of outcomes NatWest Group needs  to be prepared for. Management responded quickly to the impact of the  Russia/Ukraine conflict providing the Committee with updated scenarios to  reflect the range of potential risk and uncertainties posed. BRC considered  the stress scenarios to be used for monitoring a moderate, severe and  extreme stress, including for the 2023 Bank of England Annual Cyclical  Scenario (ACS) Stress Test and recommended the same to the Board  for approval. Bank of England stress tests  -- BRC challenged and scrutinised the  outputs of the 2022 Bank of England Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS)  Stress Test (*)  and recommended it to the Board.

This included playing an important role in overseeing progress and performance against NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy on behalf of the Board. This year our agendas and discussions have reflected the challenging external environment, both economic and regulatory, and how it is impacting our stakeholders as well as our sustainable business model.\n\nIn response to feedback arising from the 2021 performance evaluation and working together with the management team, we have worked to drive action and effect change in the areas within our remit.\n\n## 2022 Highlights\n\nWe held several spotlight sessions throughout the year, covering the pillars of our purpose (climate, learning and enterprise), as well as customer, people and culture, and conduct and ethics. The views of internal and external stakeholders were sought wherever possible and meeting time was prioritised towards meaningful debate and discussion.\n\n## Membership, Meetings and Escalation\n\nThere were no changes to the Committee's membership during 2022. Membership of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee continued to comprise three non-executive directors as members, with two non-executive directors from NatWest Group's ring-fenced bank Board observing, along with management attendees. More details of membership and attendance of the Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance report.\n\n'This year our agendas and discussions have reflected the challenging external environment and how it is impacting our stakeholders as well as our sustainable business model.'\n\nThe Committee continues to hold five meetings per annum and reports to the Board on the Committee's activities after each meeting, escalating matters for the Board's attention as appropriate. An ad hoc meeting was scheduled in 2022 to revisit Climate transition plan progress including management actions raised ahead of consideration by the Board. The Committee operates under delegated authority from the Board and its terms of reference are available on natwestgroup.com. These are reviewed annually and approved by the Board.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior committees was conducted internally in 2022. It was determined that the Committee continued to operate effectively and have in-depth discussion on areas of critical importance to the purpose and long-term sustainability of NatWest Group. It was suggested that the structure of meetings be re-visited to receive more frequent updates on key matters, including emerging issues and not be duplicative with other forums. The Committee is keen for its discussions to be useful for management whilst driving further action.\n\nIn 2023 the Committee will look to ensure the areas considered by the Committee continue to add value to the Board and management, with well structured, forward-looking, customerfocused and strategic discussions. Challenging views and a diverse range of insights will continue to be sought to support the 2023 meetings.\n\nThe Committee operated within its terms of reference during the year. In July, the Committee's terms of reference were broadened to incorporate environmental (including biodiversity, forests and water) oversight to help promote the topic within the Board-level governance framework and this will be an area of focus in 2023.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Committee has continued to effectively support the Board in overseeing progress on the embedding of purpose, which will drive NatWest Group as a sustainable business generating long-term value for stakeholders. We have continued to benefit from a broad range of internal and external stakeholder perspectives, to better understand how NatWest Group's actions are supporting our customers, colleagues and society.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to the Committee's activities during 2022 and throughout my tenure as Committee Chair, including my fellow directors, attendees, and presenters, for their commitment and dedication.\n\n## Mike Rogers\n\nChair of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee 16 February 2023\n\n## Below are the key discussion points and outcomes for 2022.\n\n| Theme                                         | Principal areas of Committee focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate  and broader  environmental  progress | The Committee discussed climate  change action and progress across the  broader environmental agenda.

TIC is responsible for supporting the Board by overseeing, monitoring, and challenging the actions being taken by management in relation to technology and innovation. In doing so, the Committee also gives due consideration to NatWest Group's purpose throughout discussions. Authority is delegated to TIC by the Board and a regular report of the Committee's activities is provided to the Board. The terms of reference are available on natwestgroup.com. These are reviewed annually and approved by the NWG Board.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee has played an important role in helping to support and challenge management plans to develop sustainable relationships with our customers through technology and innovation. Below is a summary of the themes and principal areas of focus of the Committee during the year.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nThe Committee is comprised of three non-executive director members, Frank Dangeard, Patrick Flynn, and me. More details of membership and attendance at meetings can be found on pages 86 to 89 of the Governance Report. As agreed, as part of the 2021 Committee evaluation, an invitation to each TIC meeting was extended to all Board members and a number of Board Directors have attended meetings during the year.\n\n'The Committee has played an important role in helping to support and challenge management plans to develop sustainable relationships with our customers through technology and innovation.'\n\nThe Committee is supported by management and the Group CEO, Group CFO, Group Chief Information Officer (previously the Chief Administration Officer), Group CRO, Director of Strategy & Corporate Development and Chief Technology Officer are all standing attendees. External insights were provided through the updates provided by management and through attendance by external guests.\n\nThe Committee held four scheduled meetings during 2021. One meeting was convened virtually with three meetings held in person.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe 2022 review of the Committee's effectiveness was undertaken internally. Key findings included a reduction in the number of meetings to three longer meetings each year from 2023; the opportunity for management to make greater use of the Committee as a sounding board; and consideration of how the expertise of the Technology Advisory Board could be leveraged more. It was agreed that these actions would be addressed during 2023. The Committee continued to act in accordance with its terms of reference throughout the year.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI am delighted to chair this Committee as it continues to support the Board in an area core to the Group's purpose to champion potential, helping people, families, and businesses to thrive.\n\nThe Committee's primary focus is on management plans to leverage changes to future technology, the innovation landscape and its impact on NatWest Group's purpose to ensure we remain relevant for the future and improve service provided to the customers, colleagues and communities which we serve.\n\nI want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee members and attendees for their continued commitment during 2022.\n\n## Yasmin Jetha\n\nChair of the Technology & Innovation Committee 16 February 2023\n\n## Theme\n\n## Principal areas of Committee focus\n\n## Outcomes\n\nDigitisation of NatWest Group to deliver enhanced customer value\n\nThe Committee has considered how the modernisation of our technology is helping us better address customer needs, and improve the health and resilience of our estate.\n\nTo support this area of focus the Committee received an update on modernising technology and progress made by NatWest Group. In particular on resolving legacy and complexity issues in respect of the architecture, allowing increased agility and responsiveness to customer and colleague needs. This included the use of predictive modelling of customer lifetime value.\n\nThe Committee also discussed the evolution of open finance from a response to a regulatory requirement to focus on new products, services and revenue streams which leverage the modern architectural patterns used within NatWest Group.\n\nA spotlight on the use of the cloud, including how NatWest Group leveraged a variety of hosting environments; and how this would drive competitive advantage was considered.\n\nFinally, an update on the data strategy was provided.\n\n## Modernisation of the technology estate:\n\nThe Committee was keen to understand how NatWest Group was positioned versus peers. The Committee queried how challenges resulting from internal processes slowing progress on delivery for customers and colleagues would be addressed and encouraged strong linkage to important business services and customer journeys to ensure customer centricity of design for new architecture. A spotlight on a new depository services platform within C&I, which would help protect investors and oversee fund managers, was provided.\n\nOpen finance: Management explained the approach to driving increased commercialisation of open finance and the Committee discussed the potential size of the opportunity together with how initiatives could be used across the organisation.\n\nLeveraging cloud: The Committee discussed NatWest Group's position versus peer banks, with reference to a Gartner research paper, and how this aligned with regulatory views on NatWest Group's position. Consideration was given to the potential impact of the entry of large cloud service providers into financial services.\n\nData Strategy: The update considered potential disruption to NatWest Group's income streams from big technology companies. It also considered the purpose-led approach to the implementation of the data strategy with firm guardrails established to ensure that public trust was not eroded.",

This included an update on the Ventures  portfolio with deep dives on Mettle (our  digital banking proposition for small  businesses to combine their current  account with invoicing, payments and  bookkeeping capabilities) and Take  Payments formerly Tyl (merchant | Ventures:  Key areas of discussion included the progress made  on the growth ambitions for Take Payments and the launch of the  cloud based platform for Mettle. Lessons learned including the level  of talent attracted, support from the franchises and funding were  considered. Use of NatWest branding for new innovation activity  was discussed noting that this was in line with the decision to  merge innovation with main business activity. Partnership update:  considered how partnerships were being  developed, were focused on genuine customer need, and were  carried out on a One Bank basis. The culture of partnership  working was considered and the Committee sought confirmation |\n\n| Theme        | Principal areas of Committee focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future Ready | The Committee sought to understand  the role NatWest Group can play in the  value chain and future financial services  to stay relevant to customers. This included discussion of the use  of technology by the Security team  and potential future opportunities to  monetise NatWest Group's services;  NatWest Group's approach to digital  assets; and the evolving future  landscape and technology trends. | Security, Trust & Protection:  The Committee considered how  NatWest Group's position as trusted data custodian could help  support customers from a security perspective, particularly  customer identity attribute sharing and opportunities to help reduce  levels of fraud across the industry. The challenges in progressing  initiatives, including the value of industry-wide solutions and legal  and regulatory hurdles was discussed. This is an area that will  continue to be kept under consideration and investment in future. Digital Assets : The outcome of pilot activity undertaken to test  NatWest Group's appetite to offer digital currencies to a range of  customer groups was discussed and the reduced attractiveness  of digital currencies following external market developments was  noted. The potential broader future use of digital assets and digital  ledger technology would continue to be kept under review given  the potential impact in future periods. |",

I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to Robert for his considerable contribution to remuneration practices at NatWest Group. Robert steered the committee with great skill and determination through a period of significant transition for the organisation. I have been a member of the committee since April 2020 which has helped to facilitate a smooth handover in our responsibilities.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues with the cost of living\n\nI want to begin by acknowledging that, very understandably, the cost-of-living crisis has been a great concern for many of our customers and colleagues. As a committee, we have discussed the impact of this situation at length and the ways in which we can help colleagues through this difficult and unsettling time. Our colleagues are at the heart of our purpose and our aim has been to respond in a sensitive and transparent way, as we have done throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs part of the process, we dedicated time to understand the concerns of individuals across the organisation. I have been particularly close to this in the role I held as Chair of the Colleague Advisory Panel. This has given me a deep understanding of our wider workforce practices and how colleagues feel about working for NatWest Group. Our approach to remuneration is that colleagues must be paid fairly for the role they perform and in ways that support our values and culture.\n\n## Support for colleagues over the last 12 months\n\n## April 2022\n\n## - scheduled annual salary review\n\n- \u00b7 3.6% average increase across our global workforce, our largest investment in pay for over five years.\n- \u00b7 Majority of our most junior UK colleagues received at least 4% with 38% receiving 5% or more.\n\n## September 2022\n\n## - additional targeted action\n\n- \u00b7 c.22,000 of our lowest-paid colleagues globally received a further permanent pay rise.\n- \u00b7 UK colleagues earning \u00a332,000 or less received a 4% salary increase and we increased our salary ranges by 4%. This resulted in an average increase of \u00a31,000 for impacted colleagues.\n- \u00b7 Our investment in fixed pay in April and September 2022 combined was \u00a3115 million per annum, an increase of 85% on 2021.\n\n## December 2022\n\n## - further support announced\n\n- \u00b7 A one-off cash payment in January 2023 to approximately 60,000 colleagues, worth \u00a31,000 for UK colleagues.\n- \u00b7 From April 2023, nearly 90% of our junior UK colleagues (A and B grades) covered by our negotiated pay approach will receive a salary increase of at least 7%, and almost two thirds will receive 8% or more, on top of the \u00a31,000 payment in January.\n- \u00b7 Broad parts of the UK workforce, including A to C grade colleagues, will receive salary increases of at least \u00a32,000 and salary ranges have also been improved by 6% or more since September 2022.\n\nThis support is in addition to the significant investment in colleagues' learning, development and wellbeing.\n\nFollowing an extensive data-led review of pay across the organisation, a permanent uplift to base pay of 4% was agreed to support our lower paid colleagues from September 2022. This targeted action was made in consultation with our employee representative bodies and welcomed by many, and was intended to help those colleagues most likely to be affected by the sudden spike in inflation. However, I know that cost-of-living pressures have intensified since then and are being felt broadly across the workforce.\n\nWe have sought to build on this action as part of our year-end pay decisions for 2022. In the next stage of our support, we made a one-off cash payment to around 60,000 colleagues (more than 95% of the workforce) in January 2023. We also announced significant salary increases to take place from April 2023 for a broad range of colleagues.\n\nIf we look at the year-on-year position, a junior colleague in the UK will typically have received salary uplifts of 4% in both April and September 2022, a one-off payment of \u00a31,000 in January 2023, with a further salary increase of c.7% to come in April 2023. In total this equates to a c.15% salary increase for most A and B grade colleagues. I believe this is a clear demonstration of our determination to invest in colleagues' pay. The lowest starting salary will also rise to \u00a322,000 on a full-time basis, an increase of 16% since April 2022.\n\nNatWest Group has been an accredited Living Wage employer in the UK since 2014 and sets pay levels above the real living wage (RLW) rates. We take a similar approach across our major hubs outside the UK. Following the early announcement of the new RLW rates in 2022, we agreed to immediately increase pay for our colleagues and relevant suppliers ahead of the May 2023 deadline.\n\nIn these current extraordinary circumstances, we know that it is impossible to entirely insulate colleagues from inflationary pressures. However, we believe the actions we have taken will deliver a significantly improved and competitive level of pay in all our markets. We engaged again with our employee representative bodies and I am delighted that the latest proposal was supported by their members in the ballot.\n\nOur decisions aim to balance the current economic context and managing our long-term cost base with business performance and our need to pay fairly and retain critical market skills. It was important that we recognised the squeeze in living standards and the dedication of colleagues in delivering strong performance during a turbulent year.\n\n## Other support for the wider workforce\n\nFinancial wellbeing is vitally important and colleagues are supported with access to pension and protection products, shopping discounts, support with budgeting and help with managing debt. Over 20,000 colleagues contribute to Sharesave each month. Sharesave is available to 97% of colleagues, with participants across the UK, Ireland, India and Poland, and is particularly popular with our more junior colleagues. It provides an opportunity for colleagues to benefit from increases in the NatWest Group share price with limited risk, encouraging financial capability and aligning their interests with shareholders.\n\nAnother way that we champion the potential of colleagues is by providing extensive development opportunities and dedicated learning days. During 2022 we extended this to give each colleague two days to learn new skills for the future. There is also a comprehensive wellbeing programme, supporting a range of mental health and financial health initiatives.\n\nI am also very proud of our new Partner Leave policies, promoting a shared approach to caring and helping growing families to thrive. The policies introduce the same pay and leave entitlements as local Maternity and Adoption Leave policies for eligible fathers and partners to share the caring responsibilities.\n\n## Pay gap reporting\n\nWe are making good progress in building a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace and the committee reviews gender and ethnicity pay gap metrics as part of the process. This is the fifth year that we have published ethnicity pay gap information on a voluntary basis. For the first time, we have disaggregated our ethnicity pay gaps to compare Black, Asian, mixed and multiple and minority ethnic average hourly pay to that of White colleagues.\n\nWe are confident that our colleagues are paid fairly and policies and processes are kept under review to make sure this continues to be the case. You can find full details of our pay gap reporting in the Strategic report and at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## How we assess performance\n\nOur purpose-led strategic priorities are communicated to all colleagues. The performance goals and measures agreed for the executive directors flow through to the executive management team, adjusted as appropriate to reflect individual areas of responsibility. The remuneration construct agreed for executive directors also applies to members of the NatWest Group and NWH Executive Committees.\n\nThis alignment at senior level is continued with performance goals and measures cascading further through the organisation, providing consistency in approach across the workforce. Performance against these goals and targets is directly linked to performance ratings and variable pay decisions at an individual level, and the business-level assessments are reflected in performance adjustments to the bonus pool.\n\n## Performance highlights for 2022\n\nIn a difficult macroeconomic environment, NatWest Group has demonstrated resilience and performed strongly in 2022. Income has grown, reflecting increased lending in key areas and the impact of base rate increases. In assessing the performance of the executive directors, we made a downward adjustment for the material changes in the base rate against our assumptions for the year. The adjustment was made so that management did not benefit from the element of performance that we deemed to be outside their control. Our capital distribution plan has continued to deliver good value for shareholders and we are well placed to invest for growth and provide the support our customers need.",

The bonus pool was determined in the context of strong financial and capital performance, with the distribution of \u00a35.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. The committee agreed a 2022 bonus pool of \u00a3367.5 million for those colleagues who are eligible to receive an award.\n\nThis is around 23% higher than the 2021 bonus pool, with the increase largely the result of strong performance, an increase in the number of bonus-eligible colleagues and the fact that last year's bonus pool was materially reduced to reflect the fine imposed by the FCA on National Westminster Bank Plc in 2021 for past breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.\n\n## Remuneration policy for executive directors\n\nWe obtained approval for a new directors' remuneration policy (the Policy) at our 2022 AGM. The Board was delighted with the strong level of support from shareholders, with around 93% of votes in favour. The final form of the Policy reflected feedback received from shareholders including a preference to reduce committee discretion in assessing performance.\n\nOur previous Policy differed in a number of ways to traditional practice, with no annual bonus and a unique long-term incentive construct that delivered significantly reduced quantum compared to peers. As disclosed in last year's report, we considered shareholder guidelines that normally expect an appropriate discount, of at least 50%, to be applied when introducing restricted share plan (RSP) awards compared to a traditional LTIP. The committee was satisfied that the move to the RSP is aligned with the spirit of the guidelines as it delivers more than a 50% reduction when the RSP is compared to traditional LTIPs envisaged by the guidance.\n\nUnder the new Policy, annual bonus awards, with formulaic, weighted measures and purpose-led targets, are complemented by RSP awards that support longer-term performance and shareholder alignment. The Policy addresses our need for a more market-facing and competitive pay construct that still supports prudent risk management. The Board remains very aware of the importance of recognising good performance and the need to attract and retain highly talented colleagues.\n\nGreater performance-related pay results in expected compensation rising, with the increase being phased over two years given this is a significant change. For 2022, the first year of the Policy, expected compensation rose 10% for the CEO and 4% for the CFO. A further increase for performance year 2023, the second year of the transition, will result in NatWest Group moving closer to, but still below, the average expected compensation levels paid by other major UK banks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Strategic KPIs in annual  bonus awards for 2022   | Further information                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial (60%)                                   | The performance  assessment against the  bonus targets for 2022  is summarised on page  Return on Tangible Equity |\n| Income growth                                     | 142 and set out in full                                                                                           |\n| Cost reduction                                    | on page 153.                                                                                                      |\n| Medium-term capital target                        | performance was                                                                                                   |\n| Climate                                           | found on page 157.                                                                                                |\n| Customer                                          | The performance  assessment against the  bonus targets for 2022  is summarised on page  Return on Tangible Equity |\n| Purpose, culture and people                       | The performance  assessment against the  bonus targets for 2022  is summarised on page  Return on Tangible Equity |\n| Enterprise and capability                         | The performance  assessment against the  bonus targets for 2022  is summarised on page  Return on Tangible Equity |\n| Personal (5%)                                     | Personal (5%)                                                                                                     |\n\nA risk modifier also applies, enabling risk performance to be assessed and awards reduced, potentially to zero.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for 2022\n\n2022 was a strong year for the business and these results were directly reflected in remuneration outcomes. In the first year of the Policy, maximum bonus awards were limited to 85% of salary and RSP awards were limited to 125% of salary. The assessment of performance against the scorecard resulted in proposed awards for the CEO and CFO of 67.76% and 64.26% of maximum opportunity respectively. The committee considered this to be a fair reflection of an impressive performance, noting that the majority of targets were met or exceeded. While people and culture scores had deteriorated slightly, this was expected in the current macro environment and scores remain very strong compared to market norms.\n\nThe committee also approved that RSP awards would be granted at maximum as satisfactory performance had been achieved over the year prior to award. The vesting of the RSP awards will be subject to assessment against pre-determined criteria that take into account whether sustainable performance has been delivered over the three years after grant.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) awards granted in 2020\n\nLTI awards were granted to both executive directors in March 2020. Prior to the awards being granted to the CEO and CFO, reductions of 22% and 27% respectively were applied to the maximum award as a result of the pre-grant performance assessment over 2019. In December 2022, we considered whether anything had come to light since the grant which would change our original view of performance.\n\nThe outcome of the pre-vest assessment was that there had been no material deterioration in financial, customer, risk and culture performance since grant. Therefore, a sustainable level of performance had been achieved and no further adjustments were necessary under the pre-vest test.\n\n| 2020 LTI shares   | Maximum   | Granted   | Due to vest   |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Alison Rose       | 1,131,488 | 881,679   | 881,679       |\n| Katie Murray      | 881,679   | 646,565   | 646,565       |\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nHow we reward and support colleagues will remain under the spotlight for some time, given the macroeconomic headwinds and competitive market for the best talent. We will continue to monitor the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on the workforce and look to balance the needs of all our stakeholders through our oversight of performance and remuneration. Our approach is founded on rewarding colleagues in a fair, sustainable and transparent way.\n\nWith this in mind, and to support the refreshed strategy announced in February 2023 and new financial plan, the committee has approved a new Sharing in Success scheme to award colleagues NatWest Group shares. The scheme is intended to recognise one bank behaviours, drive a performance culture with purpose-led outcomes and further align colleagues with our strategic direction.\n\nSince 2017, all A grade and most B grade junior colleagues have received fixed pay only which provides protection from pay volatility. As our performance has improved, it feels like the right time to recognise the contribution of all colleagues to the bank's success. The scheme will be a welcome addition to our employee value proposition, alongside broader policy enhancements, which will help in light of market competition for talent.\n\nSubject to performance criteria being met over 2023, the first awards will be delivered to colleagues in NatWest Group shares in 2024. Awards will have a maximum value of \u00a31,500 per colleague (adjusted for local salary levels). All colleagues will be eligible under the scheme.\n\nThe awards were granted at a time when the true impact of COVID-19 was just beginning to emerge. The committee has considered whether the vesting of these awards could result in a potential windfall gain. Using the methodology that we disclosed in our 2020 Directors' remuneration report, we looked at a range of factors including the LTI grant price against pre COVID-19 levels, the relative share price performance of NatWest Group and waivers and reductions applied to the executive directors' pay in the pre-vest period. The committee was satisfied that, taking all the relevant circumstances into account, no further adjustment for windfall gains was required. Further details on the performance and windfall gains assessment can be found on page 156.\n\n## Implementation of the Policy for 2023\n\nIn December 2022, we also approved salary increases for the executive directors at 3%, which is less than half of the average salary increase for the global workforce at 6.4%. The increases will apply from April 2023. As the transition period for the Policy has now ended, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2023 will be 100% of salary and maximum RSP awards will be 150% of salary. The committee reviewed the 2023 performance measures for annual bonus awards and the underpin criteria for RSP awards, as detailed later in this report, which continue to align with our purpose-led strategy.\n\nFrom my recent meetings with shareholders, I know that aligning ESG measures with executive directors' remuneration remains a priority area. It is vital that we deliver on our climate and broader societal ambitions. We will continue to use ESG performance metrics for variable pay that are demanding, quantifiable and clearly linked to our strategy.\n\nWe also discussed the UK Government's proposal to remove the bonus cap for UK banks, which is currently subject to consultation. The cap limits variable pay to no more than two times the level of fixed pay. NatWest Group has operated within a one-to-one ratio of variable to fixed pay since the regulations came into force in 2014.\n\nThe proposal is that, from performance year 2024, it will be up to UK banks to set an appropriate ratio between the fixed and variable components of total remuneration. Over the next year, we will assess any impact for NatWest Group and confirm details in our next report. Importantly, the strict rules relating to deferral, delivery in shares, and malus and clawback will all remain in place.\n\nI hope this letter and the information that follows will explain our approach to remuneration for 2022. I am very grateful for the support received from our stakeholders during this process and would also like to thank my fellow committee members for their valuable contribution.\n\n## Lena Wilson, CBE\n\nChair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee 16 February 2023",

On-target opportunity is based on annual bonus awards at 50% of maximum and RSP awards vesting at 100% of maximum. The maximum opportunity is also shown together with the impact of a 50% increase in the share price for RSP awards over the period from grant to vest, in line with disclosure requirements.\n- (2)  The fixed pay awarded differs slightly from that under the Policy opportunity for 2022 due to salary increases applying part way through the year and the inclusion of some benefits where the amounts are not known until year end. Full details of benefits paid for 2022 can be found in the single figure table later in this report. The maximum bonus and RSP outcomes are based on salary earned during the year, which is slightly lower than the Policy opportunity due to the salary change applying part way through the year.\n\nPay awarded to the executive directors for 2022, including fixed pay, annual bonus and RSP is broadly in line with that expected under the first year of the Policy, with strong performance resulting in above target annual bonus outcomes. The single figure of remuneration, as set out on page 152, includes fixed pay and annual bonus for 2022 along with the estimated vesting value of the LTI award granted in 2020 under the previous Policy. Therefore it is a combination of the new and the old Policy.\n\n## Annual bonus scorecard outcome for 2022\n\n|                 | Annual bonus measures

Most of this investment is targeted towards our more junior roles as part of our commitment to deliver fair levels of pay throughout the organisation.\n\nThe remuneration policy supports a culture where individuals are rewarded for sustained performance and demonstrating the right behaviours. The same principles apply to everyone, adjusted to comply with local requirements. The principles are designed to:\n\n- 1.  support a performance culture - we recognise colleagues' skills and experience, the responsibilities of their job and their geographic location. Ultimately, we pay for performance, underpinned by a robust performance management process;\n- 2.  be market facing - we benchmark ourselves against peers and ensure our pay is fair, competitive and affordable; and\n- 3.  ensure compliance and governance - our reward design must be within policy, meet the expectations and requirements of our regulators and be appropriately aligned with the expectations of our shareholders and customers.\n\n| All colleagues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Certain colleagues depending on location, grade or job                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Certain colleagues depending on location, grade or job                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Certain colleagues depending on location, grade or job                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Senior executives only                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salary and  pension funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Benefits and   share plans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Role-based   allowances                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Annual bonus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RSP awards                                                                                                                                                    |\n| A competitive level of  salary paid in cash and  reviewed annually.

These differences are deliberate and recognise that it is in the best interests of our stakeholders for executive directors to have a significant proportion of their remuneration paid in shares and subject to long-term shareholding requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe listen to colleagues and use the insight we gain to attract, engage and retain the talent we need for the future.\n\n## Regular engagement\n\n- \u00b7 A colleague opinion survey (Our View) allows people to have a say on what it feels like to work at NatWest Group.\n- \u00b7 Over 48,000 (82%) of our colleagues took part in the latest survey, one of our highest response rates in the last 10 years. We also benchmark our performance against financial services and global high performance norms.\n\n## Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP)\n\nThe CAP helps us to strengthen the colleague voice in the Boardroom. It allows colleagues to engage directly with senior management and the Board on topics that are important to them. The CAP is chaired by one of our non-executive directors and membership of the panel was refreshed in 2022. It comprises a random selection of 28 colleagues who are self-nominated or part of an employee representative body.\n\nAfter each meeting, the Board receives a summary and a follow-up call is held so that members can hear how their views were shared and what happened as a result. The forum continues to be highly regarded by those who attend and has proven to be an effective way of establishing two-way dialogue between colleagues and Board members.\n\nIn May 2022, a meeting was held with members in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 increase the CAP's understanding of our approach to executive pay and its link to our ESG priorities and our purpose; and\n- \u00b7 gather the CAP's views on our approach to wider workforce and executive remuneration.\n\nMembers asked thoughtful questions on a wide range of pay-related matters. There was a discussion on the new Policy for executive directors being more aligned to market practice.\n\n- \u00b7 Regular question and answer sessions take place between colleagues and senior executives throughout the year.\n- \u00b7 Feedback from colleagues forms part of the purpose, culture and people measures that impact pay.\n- \u00b7 We also consult with our employee representative bodies on remuneration at relevant points during the year.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the merits of increasing executive pay in the context of higher household bills. It was explained that the changes moved remuneration for executive directors closer to, but still below, the average paid by their peers. Members were also reminded that, at a previous session, some had asked whether pay for the CEO was enough. Colleagues are remunerated according to our Fair Pay Charter and consistent reward principles. Across the workforce we take into account the job market, company and individual performance as well as changes in the external environment.\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis was, understandably, one of the main themes during the discussion. The CAP acknowledged that the increase in the cost of living was not the bank's sole responsibility but noted that front-line colleagues in particular were feeling the impact. It was confirmed that the issue was high on the Executive Committee's agenda, and action was subsequently taken in September by providing a permanent salary increase for c.22,000 of our lowest-paid colleagues.\n\nAnother suggestion from members was that the benefit platform could be reviewed in light of the economic conditions and a number of enhancements were made to the offering in the second half of the year, including reducing the excess payable on some policies.",

The majority of colleagues at our two most junior grades in the UK will receive a salary increase of at least 7% in April 2023 in addition to the \u00a31,000 payment in January. Salary ranges have been increased by 6% or more and the lowest starting salary will rise to \u00a322,000 (pro rata), an uplift of 16% since April 2022.\n\n## Financial Wellbeing hub\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have provided colleagues with comprehensive financial wellbeing support including access to pension and protection products as well as colleague discounts, support with budgeting and planning, and help with managing debt and financial abuse.\n\nWe upgraded our benefits platform in 2022 and negotiated a reduction on the excess payable on some insurance products.\n\n## Dedicated learning and volunteering days\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe give all colleagues two days each year so they can develop their skills, be future ready and have opportunities to progress. 96% of colleagues have accessed the NatWest Group Academy since its launch.\n\nColleagues also receive three volunteering days each year, an opportunity for them to help causes they care about and support local communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fair Pay Accredited Living Wage\n\nemployer in the UK since 2014\n\nand we set our pay levels above the real living wage (RLW) rates. We take a similar approach across our major hubs outside the UK.\n\nFollowing the early announcement of the new RLW rates in 2022, we agreed to immediately increase pay for our colleagues and relevant suppliers.\n\n## Employee Value Proposition\n\n## New partner leave and menopause support\n\nWe offer a market-leading approach to partner leave, increasing the time that partners can spend with their new child. The policies introduce the same pay and leave entitlements as local Maternity and Adoption Leave policies for eligible fathers and partners to share the caring responsibilities.\n\nThis ultimately champions the potential of both parents and promotes gender equality in the workplace.\n\nThe menopause is such an important topic and, working with Peppy Health, we launched a brand new digital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduct providing colleagues and their partners with online support and access to specialist clinicians. Over 1,000 of our colleagues downloaded the app within the first few weeks.\n\n## Mental Health\n\nWe were delighted to partner with Just Ask A Question (JAAQ), a new mental health and wellbeing social media platform that will allow us to speak with colleagues in a new way.\n\n## How the committee oversees wider workforce remuneration\n\nEach year, the committee:\n\nApproves the remuneration policy principles , which are applied consistently across NatWest Group, and reviews the policy's implementation. The committee is supported by Subsidiary Performance and Remuneration Committees which review whether the policies and practices are appropriate at the respective legal entity level.\n\n## Reviews and approves share plan\n\nofferings for colleagues. In 2022, Sharesave was offered in the UK, Poland and India, encouraging colleagues to think about their financial wellbeing with an option to buy NatWest Group shares.\n\nConsiders a report on how pay has been distributed across the workforce during the year. The report includes analysis of performance ratings by grade and diversity categories and there are checks in place to ensure that decisions are made fairly.\n\n## Reviews the annual spend on fixed\n\npay (approximately half of the workforce receive fixed pay only). We have targeted recent increases towards our most junior colleagues, areas where specialist skills are required leading to high attrition rates and those lowest in their salary range.\n\n## Aligning remuneration with our culture\n\nIn determining performance outcomes, we consider both the achievements made and how they have been delivered. Our Code of Conduct sets out clear expectations of appropriate behavioural standards, supported by Our Values which guide colleagues in doing the right thing. In 2022, over 11,000 colleagues, customers and community partners helped to co-create our refreshed values to reflect our purpose.\n\nEach role has defined behaviours set out in our Critical People Capabilities which directly link to our purpose and values and are used in performance management. If a colleague's behaviour falls below these expectations, this will be reflected in their performance rating, fixed pay progression and variable pay decisions (where their role is eligible to receive variable pay). The governance of culture is clearly laid out with specific senior manager roles having defined accountabilities which are reflected in their performance and pay decisions.\n\nCreating a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is integral to fulfilling our purpose. It enables us to work together to achieve great things with our colleagues, communities and customers. Performance measures to support progress in this area affect the pay of executive directors, senior management and other bonus-eligible colleagues.\n\nWe have a target to have full gender balance in our CEO-3 and above global roles by 2030.

This represents an increase of 12% since targets were introduced in 2015.\n\nIntroduced in 2018, our ethnicity target is to have 14% of colleagues from an ethnic minority background in CEO-4 and above positions in the UK by 2025. At 31 December 2022, of 82% of colleagues who disclosed their ethnicity, we have an aggregate 11% of colleagues from an ethnic minority background in our CEO-4 and above positions. This represents a 3% increase since targets were introduced and remains consistent from 2021.\n\nPay equality, including neutrality in respect of protected characteristics such as sex and race is a core feature of our approach, to support equal pay for equal work.\n\n## Further information on our workforce approach\n\nYou can find the latest gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting for NatWest Group together with the steps being taken to address the position in the 'Diversity, equity and inclusion' section of the Strategic Report and at natwestgroup.com.

People targets have featured in our strategic scorecard for over ten years, evolving beyond employee engagement to incorporate purpose, culture and diversity targets. Playing an active role in the transition to a low-carbon economy is a core part of our purpose and climate targets have been part of our executive director scorecard since 2020. There are also targets to build financial capability and support equality of opportunity through diverse enterprise.\n\nIn a number of areas our ESG ambitions stretch over several years. However, we are clear on the specific measures and targets set for each year and publish these externally. The committee and the Board reviews and approves these annually to align with our latest strategic focus areas. You can find further information on how executive director performance measures align with the five principles of a purpose-led business in our ESG Disclosures Report, available on natwestgroup.com.\n\nTurning to the wider workforce, the annual bonus pool is based on a balanced scorecard of measures which includes climate, enterprise, financial capability, purpose, culture and people measures, broadly aligning with the position for the executive directors. Allocation from the pool depends on the performance of the business area and the individual. This helps to provide a consistent approach to ESG performance and its impact on variable pay throughout the organisation.\n\n## Shareholder engagement outcomes\n\nEvery year we undertake an engagement programme with major shareholders and other stakeholders before the committee makes its final decisions on pay awards. In late 2022, we met with a number of our institutional shareholders, UK Government Investments, proxy advisors and the UK regulators to discuss our approach to remuneration for the year.\n\nThe meetings were generally positive with the committee Chair explaining our pay philosophy and no material concerns being raised. Wider workforce initiatives was the predominant issue raised, with investors and the proxy advisors interested to hear how the cost-of-living crisis was expected to impact NatWest Group's approach to executive and wider workforce pay. The committee Chair explained the steps being taken to support the workforce at this time and confirmed that the Board takes wider workforce engagement very seriously.\n\nOther recurring topics in meetings included our treatment of potential windfall gains, the measurement of bonus pool financial performance, the use of ESG metrics in remuneration and the retention and recruitment of talent. Investors also continued to stress the importance of clear disclosures to assist their view of our approach to pay.\n\nIn addition, we held two virtual shareholder events with retail shareholders in 2022 in order to hear from the wider shareholder base. During the events, shareholders raised questions on staff retention, our response to the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on our colleagues and the increase in remuneration for the CEO under the new Policy. We are very grateful that our stakeholders continue to take the time to engage with us in an open and constructive way.\n\n## Adjusting remuneration in light of new information\n\nAn accountability review process allows NatWest Group to respond where new information would change our variable pay decisions made in previous years and/or the decisions to be made in the current year. The process seeks to identify material risk management issues, control weaknesses, policy breaches and conduct failings, and enables commensurate ex-post risk adjustments to be applied to variable pay.\n\nMalus provisions allow us to reduce the amount of any unvested variable pay awards, potentially to zero, prior to payment. Clawback can be used to recover variable pay awards that have already vested and we can also apply in-year bonus reductions to adjust variable pay that would have otherwise been awarded for the current year.\n\nThe circumstances in which we may make adjustments include:\n\n- \u00b7 conduct which results in significant financial losses for NatWest Group;\n- \u00b7 an individual failing to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety;\n- \u00b7 an individual's misbehaviour or material error;\n- \u00b7 NatWest Group or the individual's business unit suffering a material failure of risk management; and\n- \u00b7 for malus and in-year bonus reduction only, circumstances where there has been a material downturn in financial performance.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive and further circumstances may be considered where appropriate.",

Bonus awards are expected to be made at 50% of maximum provided that target performance has been achieved. The outcome of the assessment against the measures and targets under the bonus scorecard is set out in full on the next page.\n\nThe committee noted that the CEO had performed strongly over the year, which was evident from the bonus scorecard and supported by other factors including positive share price movement and broker recommendations, indicating market confidence in management's actions. NatWest Group had remained open for mortgage business despite market volatility and the CEO had continued to build a strong team in a difficult hiring environment as well as implementing well-judged cost-of-living initiatives. In terms of personal measures, the committee recognised good progress on One Bank transformation, the exit of UBIDAC, standing up the new Commercial & Institutional business segment, supporting the climate agenda and cementing relationships with our key partners.\n\nThe CFO was also considered to have delivered good overall performance with strong engagement with investors throughout the year and her continued contribution to the long-term strategy and our investment cycle through to 2028. The committee noted that good progress had been made on the Finance transformation programme as well as succession planning and building bench strength. There had also been significant progress with our climate and purpose reporting framework.\n\nThe bonus scorecard takes into account the context in which performance was delivered. In assessing financial performance, a downward adjustment was made for the material changes in the base rate against our assumptions for the year, as explained in the footnotes to the scorecard. The committee also considered a downward risk modifier which enables risk performance to be assessed and awards reduced, potentially to zero. Downward adjustments of 3% were applied for the CEO and 2.5% for the CFO to reflect risk performance against core goals, balanced by strong leadership behaviours. The committee believed the final outcome reflected the considerable achievements by the executive directors through a challenging year and therefore no further discretion was applied to the resulting award levels.\n\nThe maximum bonus award under the Policy is set at 100% of base salary, however, in the first year of implementation awards were limited to 85% of the base salary paid during 2022. The final bonus amounts are set out below and awards will be made in early 2023, spilt equally in cash and shares. Malus and clawback provisions apply to the awards and the shares will be subject to a 12-month retention period.\n\n|              | Maximum   award   | Reduction for  performance   | Final bonus

Items will only be adjusted if this results in an impact of at least 0.25% to the RoTE figure. For performance year 2022, these include:\n- a. Material changes in base rate from that assumed at the beginning of the year;\n- b. Gains from interest and FX risk management derivatives not in accounting hedge relationships, own credit adjustments, profit from insurance liabilities and the timing of FX and litigation and conduct charges; and\n- c. Deferred tax asset and effective tax rate changes.\n- (2)  Similarly, for income, the definition for the purpose of the scorecard excludes the material changes in base rate from that assumed at the beginning of the year. No adjustments are required to the reported figure for gains from interest and FX risk management derivatives not in accounting hedge relationships, own credit adjustments, profit from insurance liabilities and FX losses as notable items are already excluded from the definition of the reported figure.\n- (3)  On-target income has been set at \u00a311.5 billion, in line with the 'above \u00a311.0 billion' market guidance issued at the beginning of 2022.\n- (4)  Capital has been assessed on a qualitative basis against the range.\n- (5)  The initial Climate transition plan was deemed 'on target' performance as it has been published although work will continue on the plan.\n- (6)  As NPS is not available for NatWest Markets, an internal Customer Touchpoint Rating is applied to assess NatWest Markets' customer performance. The aggregated view reflects the contribution of each franchise to NatWest Group's income. Targets: NatWest Retail Banking NPS 14 or be 2 nd or better; NatWest Premier Banking NPS 19; Coutts NPS 48; NatWest Business Banking NPS 0 and be 3 rd or better; NatWest Commercial & Corporate Banking NPS 24 and 1 st ; RBS International NPS 33; NatWest Markets Customer Touchpoint Rating 70. We met or exceeded 5 out of the 7 customer goals set for 2022. The weighted average rating across these 7 targets means that the Customer outcome is 5.25%.\n- (7)  The targets set at the start of 2022 were to increase the percentage of females in the top three layers by 3% on aggregate and to increase the percentage of colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds by 1% on aggregate. Note that NatWest Group's management structures were revised during 2022. The representation targets were set based on the management structures in place at the start of financial year 2022 with performance assessed against these at 31 December 2022. This will differ from the year-end position quoted elsewhere in our reporting suite, which uses the structures in place as at 31 December 2022.\n- (8)  Enterprise target aimed at supporting the recovery and prioritising support for harder to reach groups with higher barriers to entering and growing a business. The support was to be distributed as follows: 75% support to UK regions outside London & South East, 60% support to females, 20% support to individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, and 20% to people intending to create purpose-led businesses. Minimum target: 33,250 businesses and 237,500 interactions, Maximum target: 38,500 businesses and 275,000 interactions (same percentage distribution as target).\n- (9)  The articulation of the 2022 target in last year's report was to reach 4 million people through financial capability interactions. The intent was to deliver 4 million interactions during the year rather than reaching 4 million people. This is consistent with our overarching ambition of delivering 15 million financial capability interactions by 2023 and the wording used to describe the financial capability measure in last year's report, which was based on the number of interactions. Performance has therefore been assessed against the intended target.\n\n(10) Amounts quoted are pre tax whereas RoTE impacts are post tax.\n\n## Vesting of 2020 LTI awards (audited)\n\nThe LTI award was granted in March 2020 in respect of performance year 2019. Prior to the awards being granted to the CEO and CFO, reductions of 22% and 27% respectively were applied to the maximum award as a result of the pre-grant performance assessment. The reductions were made as risk, customer and financial performance were not fully at the desired level. At the end of 2022, a further assessment took place to review whether anything had come to light which might call into question the original award.\n\nThe assessment found that there had been no material deterioration in financial, customer, risk and culture performance since grant. The forensic investigation of Financial Crime and Customer Due Diligence remediation had resulted in adjustments to prior vestings of the 2018 and 2019 LTI awards through the risk underpin. Given the financial crime return to risk appetite had remained on track for the objectives set, the committee and the Board determined that no further adjustment was necessary. It was noted that, while the timeline had slipped since the grant of the 2020 LTI award, this had been a contributory factor in the decision to make a 5% adjustment to the CEO and former CEO's 2019 LTI awards last year. Overall, the data indicated that the required level of sustainable performance had been achieved and no further reductions were made to the 2020 LTI awards under the pre-vest test.\n\nThe committee also considered the potential application of risk and stakeholder perception underpins, which included a detailed discussion on whether the vesting outcome could result in potential windfall gains. The committee used our pre-disclosed framework and a range of other factors to assess windfall gains and believed there was a strong rationale for not making any adjustment. Details of the pre-vest performance assessment and the process to assess windfall gains can be found on the pages that follow.\n\nA summary of the position from grant to vest is set out below along with the estimated vesting values for the 2020 LTI award, which is used in the single total figure of remuneration table. No dividend equivalents were paid prior to vesting. The shares will vest in equal amounts between 2023 and 2027, followed by a 12-month retention period. Malus and clawback provisions also apply.\n\n|                                      | Alison Rose   | Alison Rose   | Katie Murray   | Katie Murray   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2020 LTI award                       | Shares        | Value         | Shares         | Value          |\n| Maximum at grant                     | 1,131,488     | \u00a31,925,000    | 881,679        | \u00a31,500,000     |\n| Reduction for pre-grant test         | (249,809)     | (\u00a3425,000)    | (235,114)      | (\u00a3400,000)     |\n| Award granted                        | 881,679       | \u00a31,500,000    | 646,565        | \u00a31,100,000     |\n| Reduction for pre-vest test          | -             | -             | -              | -              |\n| Amount post performance tests        | 881,679       | \u00a31,500,000    | 646,565        | \u00a31,100,000     |\n| Increase in value due to share price | -             | \u00a3677,747      | -              | \u00a3497,016       |\n| Estimated vesting value              | -             | \u00a32,177,747    | -              | \u00a31,597,016     |\n\n- (1)  Share price at grant was \u00a31.701 and the estimated vesting value was based on share price of \u00a32.47, the average over the three-month period from October to December 2022.\n\n## 2020 LTI award - Pre-vest performance assessment framework\n\nLTI awards were made in early 2020 following an assessment of performance over the 2019 financial year. Before vesting, the committee carries out a further review to consider whether anything has come to light which might call the original award into question. Internal control functions and PwC, as independent advisers, the Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Group Sustainable Banking Committee (SBC) support the committee in this assessment, with the outcome set out below.\n\nLooking back to performance for 2019 and 'knowing what we know now', has NatWest Group\n\n## Core questions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhere the answer is 'Yes', three further questions are considered:\n\n- 1. Is the underperformance due to factors within management's reasonable control in the circumstances?\n- 2. Can the underperformance be linked back to the performance year to which the award relates, rather than to performance developments since?\n- 3. Is it appropriate to reflect the underperformance in the current pre-vest test (i.e. if the underperformance has not been adequately reflected in other ways such as subsequent pre-grant tests for awards granted in the interim)?\n\nIf the answer to each of these questions is 'Yes', the committee may decide that a further adjustment prior to vesting is appropriate, and it has the discretion to decide the amount.\n\n## Further analysis\n\nSince the declines in some customer metrics were not within management's control or related to 2019, there was no deterioration in financial, customer, risk and culture performance that would merit a reduction prior to vesting. The committee noted the investigation of Financial Crime and CDD remediation had resulted in adjustments to prior LTI vestings through the risk underpin. Since the timeline for financial crime return to appetite had not worsened over the course of 2022, no further adjustments were considered necessary as part of the 2020 LTI pre-vest assessment.\n\n- (1)  FSCB was formerly the Banking Standards Board. NatWest Group will cease to take part in the FSCB survey from 2022. Going forwards the LTI pre-vest culture assessment will be assessed using Our View; NatWest Group's internal colleague opinion survey.\n- Achievement of 'threshold level of sustainable performance' has been evidenced.\n\nNo adjustment proposed, subject to underpins to consider any significant risk, stakeholder or reputational matters not already captured in the performance assessment, with advice from the BRC and the SBC.",

        "page_content": "## Windfall gains\n\nThe 2020 LTI award was granted in March 2020 at a time when the true impact of COVID-19 was just beginning to emerge. Following the grant, the committee noted shareholder expectations on the need to consider whether this grant could result in potential windfall gains.\n\nIn line with guidance issued by shareholders in 2020, we implemented and disclosed a framework to assess any windfall gains related to our LTI awards. Under this framework, we take into account factors such as:\n\n- a. the level of grant price in comparison to pre-COVID-19 levels;\n- b. share price appreciation over the pre-vest period, including any share price appreciation specific to NatWest Group which would be indicative of strong management performance;\n- c. the level of share price appreciation that would indicate exceptional share price performance, such as an upper decile share price, suggesting a windfall gain may have arisen; and\n- d. reductions already applied to the executive directors' pay and award levels during the pre-grant and pre-vest performance period of the relevant LTI grant.\n\nFor the 2020 LTI award, the committee's assessment considered the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The share price for the March 2020 LTI award was 35% below the prior grant. However, the grant was not made at the lowest point of the market as both the NatWest Group share price and the FTSE saw further significant falls in the period following grant, due to the impact of COVID-19. It is only this further drop after the grant date which saw a quick recovery over 2020 as market uncertainty was removed.\n- \u00b7 During the pre-vest period following the grant of the 2020 LTI award, NatWest Group's share price performed strongly (+87%), which exceeded that of the FTSE350 Banking Index (+20%) and the FTSE100 index (+25%). This upward trend reflected the significant improvement in NatWest Group's performance over the same period, evidenced by factors such as:\n- \u00b7 our strong capital position and continued capital generation meaning we are well placed to invest for growth;\n- \u00b7 improvement in operating performance including achievement of cost reduction targets during the pre-vest performance period; and\n- \u00b7 return of surplus capital, with shareholder returns increasing from \u00a30.4 billion in 2020 to \u00a33.8 billion for 2021 and \u00a35.1 billion for 2022.\n- \u00b7 The committee also noted that the NatWest Group LTI construct was different to a more traditional LTIP construct in that LTI awards delivered lower maximum opportunity but more predictable levels of pay. Our LTI awards have the main performance test prior to grant with a further assessment prior to vesting to ensure the performance has been sustainable.\n\n- \u00b7 Under this construct, the March 2020 LTI grant to the CEO and CFO for performance year 2019, was reduced to 78% and 73% of maximum respectively, based on performance against pre-set and unadjusted targets. The committee considered this was another important consideration in making the windfall gain assessment. As the shares from the 2020 LTI award will vest between 2023 and 2027, followed by a 12-month retention period after each vesting, this will ensure there is long-term alignment with the interests of shareholders.\n- \u00b7 For the 2020 performance year, the pay for the CEO and CFO was reduced through voluntary waivers and a COVID-19 related reduction respectively. In April 2020, the CEO voluntarily decided to forgo 25% of her total fixed pay for the remainder of 2020 (reducing her fixed share allowance by \u00a3426,000). In addition, the CEO confirmed she did not wish to receive an LTI award for the 2020 performance year which the committee determined to be \u00a3899,000 as noted in the 2020 Directors' remuneration report. In total, the CEO waived \u00a31,325,000 of her 2020 pay. The CFO's LTI award for 2020 after adjustment for performance was reduced by a further \u00a3418,000 (38%) to reflect the impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe committee noted that this was a complex area and one which required them to apply judgement and to make a holistic assessment of whether, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, a windfall gain could be said to have arisen in respect of the 2020 LTI awards held by the executive directors.\n\nWhilst the committee acknowledged there was a share price fall prior to grant and a subsequent improvement, given the mitigating factors set out above, it concluded that no windfall gain had arisen and that no further adjustment was required to be made to the 2020 LTI awards prior to vesting.\n\nThe committee Chair discussed our windfall gains assessment framework in detail with our key shareholders and proxy advisors as part of the recent engagement programme, and the stakeholders at these meetings noted our proposed approach.\n\n## Share price comparison over post-grant period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scheme interests - LTI awards granted during 2022 (audited)\n\n|              | Grant date    | Face value   | Award price   | Shares  awarded (1)   | Vesting levels                                    | Performance requirements                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | 7 March  2022 | \u00a31,598,000   | \u00a31.8205       | 877,781               | Between  0% - 100%  with no set  minimum  vesting | The award was subject to a pre-grant  assessment of performance over 2021.

This assessment will operate  in a similar way to the framework for  the 2020 LTI award pre-vest assessment,  as set out above.             |\n\n## RSP awards to be granted for 2022 (audited)\n\nRSP awards are granted provided the committee considers performance over the prior year has been satisfactory, based on an assessment against our internal performance management framework. The determination of whether satisfactory performance has been achieved is based on our internal ratings scale (one to five) with a rating of three or above normally resulting in the RSP award being granted at maximum. A three rating means performance goals have been fully achieved throughout the year and behaviours have been demonstrated at the required level. Performance against regulatory accountabilities are also considered.\n\nThe maximum RSP award under the Policy in the first year of implementation was limited to 125% of base salary. The CEO and CFO received ratings of four and three respectively for 2022, meaning performance goals were fully achieved or exceeded and behaviours were demonstrated at the required level. All regulatory responsibilities were also met. Noting the achievements by both executive directors over the year and the subsequent performance ratings, the committee agreed that RSP awards would be granted at maximum, in line with the Policy.\n\nAs a result, the CEO and CFO will receive RSP awards of \u00a31,395,625 and \u00a3951,563 respectively. The awards will be delivered entirely in shares and subject to conditions before vesting as well as significant holding periods to create long-term alignment with the experience of shareholders. Malus and clawback provisions will also apply.\n\n## Pre-vest underpin\n\nThe committee will make an assessment at the end of the three-year performance period (covering financial years 2023 to 2025) to determine whether sustainable performance has been achieved. Before vesting, the outcome will be reviewed using the underpin criteria below. Following the assessment, RSP awards may vest in full, in part or lapse in their entirety, with discretion to consider other factors and apply discretion before deciding the final vesting outcome. This will mitigate any potential unintended outcomes that might arise and ensure that there is a fair outcome.\n\n## A sustainable level of performance over the period will be considered with reference to:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was the first change to the basic Board fee since 2017 and the decision was made after considering the fees paid by other major UK banks as well as salary increases for the wider workforce. The 2.5% increase was lower than the 3.6% average salary increase applied across our global workforce from April 2022. The fees for the Chairs of the Group Audit Committee, Group Board Risk Committee and the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee were increased from \u00a368,000 to \u00a373,000 per annum to bring the rates closer to market practice and to acknowledge the considerable time commitment of these roles in a regulated major bank. The composite fee for Frank Dangeard was increased from \u00a3264,000 to \u00a3270,000 to reflect the change in the basic Board fee and in view of his commitments and responsibilities as Chairman of NatWest Markets Plc. All of the changes were within the scope of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders and no directors were involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration.\n\nFor NatWest Group plc Board directors who also serve on the Boards and Committees of NatWest Holdings Limited, National Westminster Bank Plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the fees below reflect membership of all four boards and their respective Board Committees. Directors may also receive fees for membership of other subsidiary company Boards and Committees, the value of which is included below.

Ross McEwan stepped down from the Board as CEO in October 2019 and qualified for good leaver treatment in respect of his LTI awards. Mr McEwan received his final LTI award over 942,907 shares in 2020 with the award level reduced by 31% following the application of the pre-grant performance assessment. In line with the position for the current executive directors, no further reduction was made under the pre-vest test. The shares are due to vest between 2023 and 2027, subject to good leaver criteria continuing to be met. The value of the shares was \u00a31,597,016, based on the average share price over October to December 2022. There are no other payments to past directors to disclose for 2022.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy in 2023\n\n## Pay arrangements\n\nBoth executive directors will receive annual bonus and RSP awards in March 2023 in respect of the 2022 performance year. You can find details of these awards on pages 152 and 157. A 3% increase to the base salary of each executive director has been agreed from 1 April 2023, which is less than half the expected average salary increase for the global workforce at 6.4%. Pay arrangements for the 2023 performance year are set out below.\n\n|              | Salary (1 Jan 2023)   | Salary (1 Apr 2023)   | Standard  benefits (1)   | Pension       | Fixed share  allowance (2)   | Maximum bonus  award for 2023 (3)   | Maximum RSP  award for 2023 (4)   |\n|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | \u00a31,122,000            | \u00a31,155,660            | \u00a326,250                  | 10% of salary | 100% of salary               | \u00a31,147,245                          | \u00a31,720,868                        |\n| Katie Murray | \u00a3765,000              | \u00a3787,950              | \u00a326,250                  | 10% of salary | 100% of salary               | \u00a3782,213                            | \u00a31,173,319                        |\n\n## Annual bonus performance assessment for 2023\n\nThe annual bonus scorecard will be based on weighted performance measures and appropriately stretching targets across financial and non-financial areas that align with our purpose-led strategy. The main updates to the measures for 2023 are retiring our reduction in carbon emissions from own operations as this transitions to business as usual and supporting the initial Climate transition plan by targeting progress against sectoral targets.\n\nFor 2023, financial performance will represent 60% of the scorecard with target ranges set in line with the budget. Non-financial measures will be focused across climate, customer, purpose, culture and people, and enterprise and capability. These measures represent an aggregate of 35% of the scorecard and reflect our ESG priority areas as well as the importance of good customer outcomes. The remaining 5% will be assessed on Personal measures based on a discretionary assessment of the performance of each executive director over the year. A downward Risk modifier will also apply, enabling risk performance to be assessed and awards reduced, potentially to zero.\n\nThreshold and maximum targets will be disclosed retrospectively at the end of the performance period in the 2023 Directors' remuneration report, alongside the actual level of performance achieved and associated narrative. No award will be made if threshold performance, as determined by the committee, is not achieved. The level of the award to be paid will vary between 10% for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. Target performance will pay out at 50% of maximum opportunity.\n\nAll assessments of performance are subject to the committee's judgment to determine the appropriate outcome. Discretion will only be used by the committee when the application of the formulaic performance outcome drives an unrepresentative outcome or when it is necessary to take into account strategic, economic or societal impacts that were not or could not have been accounted for at the point of agreeing the bonus scorecard.\n\n## Annual bonus performance measures and targets for 2023\n\n| Category                 | Performance measures                                                 | Target                                                                                                                                                                             | Weighting %   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n|                          |                                                                      | Financial                                                                                                                                                                          |               |\n| Financial (60%)          | Group RoTE.                                                          | Targets set and the extent of their achievement  will be disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report as the  committee considers them to be commercially  sensitive at this point in time. | 30%           |\n|                          | Group underlying income excluding notable items.                     | \u00a314.8 billion                                                                                                                                                                      | 10%           |\n|                          | Group operating expenses, excluding litigation and  conduct costs.   | \u00a37.6 billion                                                                                                                                                                       | 10%           |\n|                          | Progress to medium-term capital target.                              | CET1 target range of 13-14%                                                                                                                                                        | 10%           |\n|                          |                                                                      | Non-Financial                                                                                                                                                                      |               |\n| Strategic  (35%) Climate | Funding and financing committed to  climate and sustainable finance. | Funding and financing target of \u00a325.3 billion towards  the \u00a3100 billion target.                                                                                                    | 10%           |\n|                          | transition plan.                                                     | Implementation of the initial Climate  Four sectors on target with one of the two Assets  Under Management and Retrofit milestones achieved.                                       |               |",

This is supported by annual bonus arrangements, which ensure that executive directors are also incentivised to deliver on the key strategic priorities of NatWest Group, with robust weighted performance measures as set out on the previous page. After the pre-grant test and underpin, the RSP would be expected to pay out at 100% in the vast majority of cases to deliver the expected value under the Policy.\n\n## Pre-grant test\n\nExecutive directors will be granted an RSP award in 2024 provided the committee considers performance over 2023 has been satisfactory, based on an assessment against our performance management framework.\n\n## Pre-vest underpin\n\nRSP awards will not be subject to further performance conditions. However, before vesting, the committee will review the outcomes of the business against the following underpin criteria.\n\nA sustainable level of performance over the period will be considered with reference to:\n\n- 1. the level of capital held relative to the maximum distributable amount;\n- 2. total distributions paid relative to our distribution policy; and\n- 3. any material deterioration in the risk or regulatory compliance profile or control environment of NatWest Group, or a serious conduct or reputational event.\n\nThe committee will make an assessment at the end of the three-year performance period to determine whether sustainable performance has been achieved. The committee will refer to the above underpin criteria in determining whether this has been the case. Following the committee's assessment, RSP awards may vest in full, in part or lapse in their entirety. The committee will also retain the right to consider other factors and apply discretion before making a decision on the final vesting outcome. This will mitigate any potential unintended outcomes that might arise and ensure that there is a fair outcome. The committee will explain its reasons for applying discretion in either direction, or for not doing so.\n\n## Chairman and non-executive directors' shareholding policy and annual fees for 2023\n\nThe Chairman and non-executive directors typically hold shares in NatWest Group, recognising this is a practice that shareholders generally encourage. The shares have been acquired on a voluntary basis to date with no guidance on the level of expected shareholding. Having reflected on our current arrangements, and after considering the position at other major UK banks, the Board has decided to introduce a formal shareholding policy for these individuals from 1 January 2023. The policy does not apply to directors who are due to step down from the Board within 12 months of 1 January 2023.\n\nUnder the shareholding policy, NatWest Group will retain a portion of the net monthly basic fees (10% for the Chairman and 25% for non-executive directors) which will be used to purchase shares every quarter. The Chairman will be required to build towards a shareholding equivalent to four times the basic annual Board fee (currently \u00a3328,000) and for non-executive directors the target is one times the basic annual Board fee (currently \u00a382,000). Once the target is achieved, monthly deductions and quarterly purchases will continue at a reduced percentage of net monthly fees (5% for the Chairman and 10% for non-executive directors). The shares purchased under the shareholding policy will be held in a nominee account with dividends reinvested and shares retained until the director steps down from the Board.\n\nWe believe this is a progressive and proportionate approach to shareholder alignment that will provide consistency and ultimately higher levels of shareholdings for this cohort. It will also ensure there is a continuous element of shareholder alignment as the Chairman and non-executive directors will continue to acquire shares over their entire tenure. The annual fees for 2023 are set out below, with the fees delivered in a combination of cash and shares in line with the shareholding policy above.\n\n| Fees for NatWest Group plc Board (1)   | Rates from  1 January 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Chairman (composite fee)               | \u00a3750,000                     |\n| Non-executive director basic fee       | \u00a382,000                      |\n| Senior Independent Director            | \u00a334,000                      |\n\n| Fees for NatWest Group plc Board Committees (1)   | Member   | Chairman   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Group Board Risk Committee                        | \u00a334,000  | \u00a373,000    |\n| Group Audit Committee                             | \u00a334,000  | \u00a373,000    |\n| Group Performance and Remuneration Committee      | \u00a334,000  | \u00a373,000    |\n| Group Sustainable Banking Committee               | \u00a330,000  | \u00a360,000    |\n| Technology and Innovation Committee               | \u00a330,000  | \u00a360,000    |\n| Group Nominations and Governance Committee        | \u00a315,000  | -          |\n\nOther fees for NatWest Group plc Board directors\n\n| Chairman of NatWest Markets Plc (composite fee to cover all boards and committees)   | \u00a3270,000   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Chairman of the Colleague Advisory Panel                                             | \u00a315,000    |\n\n## Other external directorships\n\nThe Board must approve any additional appointments undertaken by directors outside NatWest Group. Steps are in place to make sure that directors comply with regulatory limits on the number of directorships held. The Board also considers whether it is appropriate for executive directors to retain any remuneration from any new external roles, depending on the appointment. You can find details of current external appointments in the biographies section of the Corporate governance report.",

        "page_content": "## Annual change in directors' pay compared to average change in employee pay\n\nRemuneration for employees is based on salary, benefits and annual bonus. The CEO and CFO receive fixed share allowances and, from the 2022 performance year onwards, annual bonus awards. As no bonus awards were made to the executive directors for the 2021 performance year, there is no prior year comparison in the table below. The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees rather than salary and do not receive any variable pay. We regularly review membership of Board Committees and changes in membership will impact the level of fees paid to non-executive directors from one year to the next. The benefits figures for non-executive directors can also change significantly year on year depending on the amount of travel undertaken in connection with Board meetings. The data for non-executive directors below reflects the value of benefits mainly falling in 2020 and 2021, due to less travel during the COVID-19 restrictions, before returning to more typical levels in 2022.\n\n|                          | 2021 to 2022   | 2021 to 2022   | 2021 to 2022   | 2020 to 2021   | 2020 to 2021   | 2020 to 2021   | 2019 to 2020   | 2019 to 2020   | 2019 to 2020   |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Annual percentage change | Salary         | Benefits (1)   | Annual  Bonus  | Salary         | Benefits (1)   | Annual   Bonus | Salary         | Benefits (1)   | Annual   Bonus |\n| UK employees (2)         | 5.20%          | 6.34%          | 42.48%         | 2.02%          | 4.68%          | 35.24%         | 2.86%          | 1.70%          | -32.4%         |\n| Executive directors      |                |                |                |                |                |                |                |                |                |\n| Alison Rose (3)          | 1.5%           | 0%             | -              | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            | -              | -              | n/a            |\n| Katie Murray             | 1.5%           | 0%             | -              | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            |\n\n| Chairman and non-executive directors   | Fees   | Benefits   | Annual  Bonus   | Fees   | Benefits   | Annual   Bonus   | Fees   | Benefits   | Annual   Bonus   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|------------|-----------------|--------|------------|------------------|--------|------------|------------------|\n| Howard Davies                          | 0%     | 8%         | n/a             | 0%     | 8%         | n/a              | 0%     | 9%         | n/a              |\n| Frank Dangeard                         | 2%     | 200%       | n/a             | 1%     | 0%         | n/a              | 0%     | -75%       | n/a              |\n| Roisin Donnelly (4)                    | -      | -          | n/a             | -      | -          | n/a              | -      | -          | n/a              |\n| Patrick Flynn                          | 2%     | 400%       | n/a             | 0%     | -67%       | n/a              | 2%     | -70%       | n/a              |\n| Morten Friis                           | 3%     | 100%       | n/a             | 17%    | 214%       | n/a              | 14%    | -80%       | n/a              |\n| Robert Gillespie (4)                   | -7%    | 750%       | n/a             | 3%     | -33%       | n/a              | -3%    | -84%       | n/a              |\n| Yasmin Jetha (4)                       | 1%     | 300%       | n/a             | 33%    | 100%       | n/a              | -      | -          | n/a              |\n| Mike Rogers                            | 4%     | -          | n/a             | 1%     | -100%      | n/a              | 0%     | -83%       | n/a              |\n| Mark Seligman                          | 4%     | 400%       | n/a             | 1%     | 0%         | n/a              | -4%    | -88%       | n/a              |\n| Lena Wilson                            | 5%     | 240%       | n/a             | 8%     | 25%        | n/a              | 16%    | -64%       | n/a              |\n\n- (4)  Roisin Donnelly joined the Board on 1 October 2022 and Yasmin Jetha re-joined the Board on 1 April 2020, so there are no prior year comparisons. Robert Gillespie stepped down from the Board with effect from 15 December 2022.\n\n## CEO to employee pay ratios\n\nThe ratios on the next page compare the total pay of the CEO, as set out in the single figure of remuneration table in this report, against the pay of three employees whose earnings represent the lower, median and upper quartiles of the UK employee population. A significant proportion of the CEO's total remuneration is delivered through long-term incentive arrangements, linked to performance and share price movements, which means this part of the ratio can fluctuate significantly from one year to the next. None of the three employees identified this year received equivalent long-term incentive arrangements. Information based on salary only is included as a further comparison.\n\nThe pay ratios reflect the diverse range of roles and pay levels across NatWest Group as a large financial services company. For the total remuneration comparison, the median employee for 2022 works in Services and the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay and reward policies for UK employees as a whole. We are determined to pay each individual a fair rate for the role performed, using consistent reward policies and offering opportunities for progression. We set out further information on our fair pay approach earlier in this report and in our supporting ESG Disclosures Report at natwestgroup.com. The change in the median pay ratio since 2018 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of performance-related pay for the CEO. In April 2020, the CEO decided to forgo 25% of her fixed pay for the rest of the year which contributed to the ratio falling in 2020 before rising in 2021.\n\nThe median pay ratio has increased further in 2022 primarily due to the CEO receiving an annual bonus award for the first time under the new Policy and a higher vesting value for the LTI award compared to last year, as a result of strong share price performance. The single figure of remuneration for the CEO, on which the pay ratio is based, includes a combination of our new and old Policies this year and this may impact the ratio in future years as any outstanding LTI awards complete their three-year performance cycle. The total remuneration for employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles have all increased year-on-year. On a comparison of salary only, the trend continues to be stable.\n\n## CEO to employee pay ratios\n\n|      |             | Pay ratios Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Pay ratios Remuneration

       |\n\nSupplementary information on the pay ratio table:\n\n- (1)  The data for 2022 is based on remuneration earned by Alison Rose, as set out in the single figure of remuneration table in this report.\n- (2)  The employees at the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentiles (lower, median and upper quartiles) were determined as at 31 December of the relevant year, based on full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees. This includes fixed pay (salary, pension funding and where relevant benefit funding and other allowances) and also any variable pay (based on the amount to be paid). For employees who work part-time, fixed pay is grossed up to the full-time equivalent.\n- (3)  'Option A' methodology was selected as this is considered the most statistically accurate method. UK employees receive a pension funding allowance set as a percentage of salary. Some employees, but not the CEO, continue to participate in the defined benefit pension scheme. Under this, it would be possible to recognise a higher value, which would in turn reduce the ratios. However, for simplicity and consistency with regulatory disclosures, we have included the pension funding allowance value in the calculation for all employees.\n- (4)  The data for the three employees identified has been considered and fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles among the UK employee population. Each of the three individuals was a full-time employee during the year and none received an exceptional award that would otherwise inflate their pay figure.\n\n## Summary of remuneration levels for employees in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration of Material Risk Takers (MRTs) in 2022\n\nEach year, we disclose the remuneration paid to individuals whose activities have a material influence over NatWest Group's performance or risk profile, known as MRTs. The disclosures are made in line with regulatory requirements and full details can be found in our Pillar 3 reports on natwestgroup.com. The tables below summarise the total pay for staff identified as MRTs for one or more entities across NatWest Group along with the number of individuals earning more than \u20ac1 million for the year. Note that the number of MRTs excludes colleagues who left NatWest Group prior to 31 December 2022 in line with regulatory requirements.\n\n| Number of MRTs           | 704     | Number of >\u20ac1m earners             |    |\n|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------------|----|\n| Remuneration (\u00a3millions) |         | \u20ac1.0 million to below \u20ac1.5 million | 53 |\n| Total fixed pay          | \u00a3196.33 | \u20ac1.5 million to below \u20ac2.0 million | 17 |\n| Total variable pay       | \u00a3106.16 | \u20ac2.0 million to below \u20ac2.5 million | 6  |\n| Total remuneration       | \u00a3302.49 | \u20ac2.5 million to below \u20ac3.0 million | 3  |\n|                          |         | \u20ac3.0 million to below \u20ac3.5 million | 1  |\n|                          |         | \u20ac3.5 million to below \u20ac4.0 million | -  |\n|                          |         | \u20ac4.0 million to below \u20ac4.5 million | 1  |\n|                          |         | Total                              | 81 |",

In order to be considered for the role of committee Chair, an individual must first have served on a remuneration committee for at least 12 months. During 2022, Robert Gillespie was the committee Chair until 24 September 2022 when he stepped down and Lena Wilson became Chair, having been a member of the committee since April 2020. Frank Dangeard, Mike Rogers and Mark Seligman were members throughout 2022. The committee held six scheduled meetings in 2022 and a further three ad hoc meetings. You can find further details on members and attendance in the Corporate governance report on page 91.\n\nThe committee is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 approving the remuneration policy for all colleagues and reviewing the effectiveness of its implementation;\n- \u00b7 reviewing performance and making recommendations to the Board on arrangements for executive directors;\n- \u00b7 approving remuneration for a defined 'in-scope' population comprising members and attendees of the Senior Executive Committees and direct reports of the CEO, control function heads and the Company Secretary. The committee also approves arrangements where individuals earn total compensation above \u00a31 million; and\n- \u00b7 setting the remuneration framework and principles for colleagues identified as Material Risk Takers (MRTs). The ToR of the committee is reviewed annually and available on natwestgroup.com\n\nThe remuneration policy operated broadly as intended during the year, with pay awarded to executive directors for 2022 broadly in line with that expected for the year. Strong performance across the annual bonus scorecard resulted in above target outcomes. The committee spent a considerable amount of time discussing the support to be provided to the wider workforce in response to the cost-of-living crisis, with a range of enhancements to colleagues' remuneration being announced.\n\nTo mitigate potential conflicts of interest, directors are not involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration. It is the committee, rather than management, that appoints remuneration advisers. Attendees also play an important role in advising the committee but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed. The Group Chief People & Transformation Officer may be present when discussions take place on senior executive pay, as there is considerable benefit from her participation. However, she is never present for discussions on her remuneration.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was first appointed as remuneration adviser by the committee in 2010 and reappointed in 2022, following an annual review of the quality of advice and the level of fees. PwC is a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to remuneration consulting in the UK. The committee also took account of the views of the Chairman, the CEO, the CFO, the Group Chief People & Transformation Officer, the Director of Reward & Employment, the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Chief Audit Executive. The committee also received input from the BRC, the GAC, the SBC and the Performance and Remuneration Committees for the principal legal entities across NatWest Group.\n\nThe professional services PwC provides in the ordinary course of business include assurance, advisory, tax and legal advice to NatWest Group subsidiaries. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is independent and objective. We also receive an annual statement setting out the protocols PwC has followed to maintain independence. There are no connections between PwC and individual directors to be disclosed. Fees paid to PwC for advising the committee are based on a fixed fee structure with any exceptional items charged on a time/cost basis. Fees for 2022 in relation to directors' remuneration amounted to \u00a3186,945 in total excluding VAT (2021 - \u00a3211,041 excluding VAT).\n\nThe 2022 evaluation was conducted internally by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. The committee acknowledged the former Chairman's stewardship through a period of significant change from a remuneration perspective, including the introduction of two new executive director remuneration policies.\n\nThe committee also recognised the positive impact of recent improvements made by the new Chair to simplify the remuneration governance framework. Such improvements were designed to reflect feedback from the committee and other board committees during 2021. Reflecting on the success of the remuneration governance review, the committee requested management to explore opportunities to optimise remuneration policies and processes during 2023. The committee discussed the focus on wider workforce pay during 2022. In recent years, pay proposals relating to the population below executive level had increasingly become a feature of the committee's oversight responsibility, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Given the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, the focus on wider workforce pay had understandably become even more pronounced during 2022. The committee agreed that it was important that it continued to have significant oversight of wider workforce pay in future.\n\n## Lena Wilson, CBE\n\nChair of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee 16 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Compliance report\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nNatWest Group plc is committed to high standards of corporate governance, business integrity and professionalism in all its activities.\n\nThroughout the year ended 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc has applied the Principles and complied with all of the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council dated July 2018 (the 'Code') except in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 Provision 17, in respect of the requirement that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the Board and senior management positions and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n- \u00b7 Provision 33 that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee (Group RemCo) should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nIn respect of Provision 17, whilst the Board is supported on board succession by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board considers this is a matter of significant importance which should rightly be reserved for the full Board. Adopting this approach ensures that all directors have an opportunity to contribute to succession planning discussions for Board and senior management, in support of achieving an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity at senior levels within NatWest Group and on the Board. It also means that all directors have an opportunity to review, consider and become familiar with the next generation of executive leaders.\n\nIn respect of Provision 33, the Board also considers that this is a matter which should rightly be reserved for the Board and this is an approach the Board has adopted for a number of years. Remuneration for the executive directors is first considered by the Group RemCo which then makes recommendations to the Board for consideration. This approach allows all non-executive directors, and not just those who are members of the Group RemCo, to participate in decisions on the executive directors' and the Chairman's remuneration and also allows the executive directors to input to the decision on the Chairman's remuneration. The Board believes this approach is very much in line with the spirit of the Code and no directors are involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration. A copy of the Code can be found at frc.org.uk.\n\nThe Board does not anticipate any changes to its approach on these aspects of the Code.\n\nFurther information on how NatWest Group plc has applied the Principles, and complied with the Provisions, of the Code can be found in the Corporate governance section of this report, which includes cross-references to relevant sections of the Strategic report and other related disclosures.\n\nNatWest Group plc has complied in all material respects with the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Audit Committees issued in September 2012 and April 2016.\n\nUnder the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, specific standards of corporate governance and business and financial disclosures and controls apply to companies with securities registered in the US. NatWest Group plc complies with all applicable sections of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, subject to a number of exceptions available to foreign private issuers.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the system of internal controls that is designed to maintain effective and efficient operations, compliant with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe system of internal controls is designed to manage, or mitigate, risk to an acceptable residual level rather than eliminate it entirely. Systems of internal control can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement, fraud or loss.\n\nOngoing processes for the identification, evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by NatWest Group operated throughout the period from 1 January 2022 to 16 February 2023, the date the directors approved the Annual Report and Accounts. These included the semi-annual Control Environment Certification process, which requires senior members of the executive and management to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control frameworks and certify that their business or function is compliant with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The policies that govern these processes - and reports on internal controls arising from them - are reviewed by the Board and meet the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.\n\nNatWest Group operates a three lines of defence model, which provides an effective apportionment of responsibilities and accountabilities across the organisation. As part of its second line of defence role, the Risk oversight function exercises oversight and challenge of the risk management activities undertaken by the first line of defence, which is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining effective processes, procedures and controls to mitigate risks within risk appetite. The Internal Audit function, which is the third line of defence, undertakes independent and objective assurance activities and provides reports to the Board and executive management on the quality and effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls to monitor, manage and mitigate risks in achieving NatWest Group's objectives.\n\nThe effectiveness of NatWest Group's internal controls is reviewed regularly by the Board, the Group Audit Committee and the Group Board Risk Committee. In addition, the Board receives a risk management report at each scheduled Board meeting. Executive management committees in each of NatWest Group's businesses also receive regular reports on significant risks facing their business and how these are being controlled. Details of the bank's approach to risk management are given in the Risk & Capital Management section of the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThroughout 2022 work continued to deliver enhancements to the control environment relating to financial crime risk. NatWest Group takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously and continues to make multi- year investments to strengthen and improve its overall financial crime framework with prevention systems and capabilities. NatWest Group also recognises the requirement to continue to invest in payments systems and remediate end of life systems in line with agreed prioritisation. A payment review was initiated in late 2022 to assess control enhancements in response to manual payment risk.\n\nNatWest Group continued to make enhancements to other aspects of the wider control environment in 2022. This has included the implementation of end-to-end risk and control self-assessments with a strategic effort to focus on control automation. This is part of the broader enterprise-wide risk management framework activity, which will continue throughout 2023. NatWest Group continued to focus on the embedding of a strong risk culture to support a robust control environment.\n\nThe remediation of known control issues continued to be an important focus for both the Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee during 2022. For further information on their oversight of remediation of the most significant issues, please refer to the Report of the Group Audit Committee and the Report of the Group Board Risk Committee. The Group Audit Committee has received confirmation that management has taken, or is taking, action to remedy significant failings or weaknesses identified through NatWest Group's control framework. The Group Audit Committee and the Group Board Risk Committee will continue to focus on such remediation activity, particularly in view of the transformation agenda.\n\nWhile not being part of the bank's system of internal control, the Group's independent auditors present to the Group Audit Committee reports that include details of any significant internal control deficiencies they have identified. Further, the system of internal controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Additional details of regulatory oversight are given in the Risk & Capital Management section.\n\nThe control environment remained largely stable in 2022. There was continuing management focus on the delivery of regulatory programmes - including the internal transformation programme established in response to updated IRB regulation from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) - as well as a review of the controls and processes relating to certain regulatory reporting. There was also significant focus on work to enhance controls relating to financial crime risks - including ongoing work to strengthen customer due diligence standards. The focus of the of NatWest Group in establishing and maintaining a robust risk culture made a valuable contribution to the overall control environment.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nNatWest Group plc is required to comply with Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022.\n\nNatWest Group has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 publication of 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework'.\n\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of 31 December 2022, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nManagement's report on NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nAs required by Exchange Act rules, management (including the Group CEO and Group CFO) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and design of NatWest Group's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act rules) as at 31 December 2022. Based on this evaluation, management (including the Group CEO and Group CFO) concluded that NatWest Group plc's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report and Accounts.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in internal control\n\nThere was no change in NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## The New York Stock Exchange\n\nAs a foreign private issuer with American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, preference shares and debt securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), NatWest Group plc is not required to comply with all of the NYSE corporate governance standards applicable to US domestic companies (the NYSE Standards) provided that it follows home country practice in lieu of the NYSE Standards and discloses any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from the NYSE Standards. NatWest Group plc is also required to provide an Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE of its compliance with the mandatory applicable NYSE Standards. In March 2022 NatWest Group plc submitted its most recent Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE which confirmed NatWest Group plc's full compliance with the applicable provisions.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee fully complies with the mandatory provisions of the NYSE Standards (including by reference to the rules of the Exchange Act) that relate to the composition, responsibilities and operation of audit committees. More detailed information about the Group Audit Committee and its work during 2022 is set out in the Group Audit Committee report on pages 108 to 116.\n\nThe Board has reviewed its corporate governance arrangements and is satisfied that these are consistent with the NYSE Standards, subject to the following departures:\n\n- i. NYSE Standards require the majority of the Board to be independent. The NYSE Standards contain different tests from the Code for determining whether a director is independent. NatWest Group plc follows the Code's requirements in determining the independence of its directors and currently has eight independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Senior Independent Director.\n- ii. The NYSE Standards require non-management directors to hold regular sessions without management present, and that independent directors meet at least once a year. The Code requires the Chairman to hold meetings with non- executive directors without the executives present and non-executive directors are to meet without the Chairman present at least once a year to appraise the Chairman's performance and NatWest Group plc complies with the requirements of the Code.\n\n- iii. The NYSE Standards require that the nominating/corporate governance committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. The Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, which is permitted under the Code (which requires that a majority of members of the committee should be independent non-executive directors). The terms of reference of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee differ in certain limited respects from the requirements set out in the NYSE Standards, including because the Group Nominations and Governance Committee does not have responsibility for overseeing the evaluation of management.\n- iv. The NYSE standards require that the compensation committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. Although the members of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee are deemed independent in compliance with the provisions of the Code, the Board has not assessed the independence of the members of the Group RemCo and Group RemCo has not assessed the independence of any compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser, in each case, in accordance with the independence tests prescribed by the NYSE Standards. The NYSE Standards require that the compensation committee must have direct responsibility to review and approve the CEO's remuneration. As stated at the start of this Compliance report, in the case of NatWest Group plc, the Board rather than the Group RemCo reserves the authority to make the final determination of the remuneration of the CEO.\n- v. The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc has complied with all of the provisions of the Code (subject to the exceptions described above) and the Code does not require NatWest Group plc to disclose the full range of corporate governance guidelines with which it complies.\n- vi. The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. NatWest Group has adopted a code of conduct which is supplemented by a number of key policies and guidance dealing with matters including, among others, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, sanctions, confidentiality, inside information, health, safety and environment, conflicts of interest, market conduct and management records. This code of conduct applies to all officers and employees and is fully aligned to the PRA and FCA Conduct Rules which apply to all directors. The Code of Conduct is available to view on NatWest Group's website at natwestgroup.com.\n\nThis Compliance report forms part of the Corporate governance report and the Report of the directors.\n\n## Report of the directors\n\nThe directors present their report together with the audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nOther information incorporated into this report by reference can be found at:\n\n|                                       | Page/Note   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Strategic report                      |             |\n| Our colleagues                        | 46          |\n| Climate-related financial disclosures | 58          |\n| Stakeholder engagement                |             |\n| Section 172(1) statement              | 40          |\n| Viability statement                   | 68          |\n| Financial review                      | 72          |\n| Board of directors and secretary      | 86          |\n| Corporate governance                  | 90          |\n| Segmental analysis                    | 319         |\n| Share capital and other equity        | 362         |\n| Post balance sheet events             | 376         |\n| Risk factors                          | 404         |\n\nDisclosures required pursuant to Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) ('2008 Regs') are located on the following pages:\n\nEmployee engagement (Paras 11 and 11A, Schedule 7, 2008 Regs):\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 36 to 41 (stakeholder engagement and section 172(1) statement)\n- \u00b7 Page 46 (Colleagues)\n- \u00b7 Pages 99 to 100 (Corporate governance report, workforce engagement)\n\nEngagement with suppliers, customers and others (Para 11B, Schedule 7, 2008 Regs):\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 36 to 41 (stakeholder engagement and section 172(1) statement)\n- \u00b7 Page 98 (Corporate governance report, stakeholder engagement)\n\n## Group structure\n\nDuring 2018, in preparation for ring-fencing a number of changes were made to the NatWest Group structure. Following these changes the company owns three main subsidiaries, NatWest Holdings Limited (the parent of the ring-fenced group which includes National Westminster Bank Plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC), NatWest Markets Plc (the investment bank and the parent of NatWest Markets N.V.) and The Royal Bank of Scotland International (Holdings) Limited (the parent of The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited).\n\nFurther details of the principal subsidiary undertakings are shown in Note 9 of the parent company financial statements and a full list of subsidiary undertakings and overseas branches is shown in Note 12 of the parent company financial statements.\n\nFollowing placing and open offers in December 2008 and in April 2009, HM Treasury (HMT) owned approximately 70.3% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the company. In December 2009, the company issued a further \u00a325.5 billion of new capital\n\nto HMT in the form of B shares. HMT sold 630 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in August 2015. In October 2015 HMT converted its entire holding of 51 billion B shares into 5.1 billion new ordinary shares of \u00a31 each in the company. HMT sold a further 925 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in June 2018.\n\nIn March 2021, the company carried out an off-market purchase of 591 million of its ordinary shares from HMT.\n\nIn May 2021, HMT sold 580 million ordinary shares through an accelerated book building process to institutional investors.\n\nIn July 2021, HMT announced its intention to sell part of its shareholding over a 12 month period from August 2021 via a trading plan, for up to 15% of the aggregate total trading volume. In June 2022 the trading plan was extended for a further 12 month term to August 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the company carried out an off-market purchase of 550 million of its ordinary shares from HMT.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, HMT's holding in the total voting rights of the company was 45.97%. The percentage was correct as at the date of notification on 21 December 2022.\n\n## Activities\n\nNatWest Group is engaged principally in providing a wide range of banking and other financial services. Further details of the organisational structure and business overview of NatWest Group, including the products and services provided by each of its operating segments and the markets in which they operate are contained in the Business review. Details of the strategy for delivering the company's objectives can be found in the Strategic report.\n\n## Results and dividends\n\nUK company law provides that dividends can only be paid if a company has sufficient distributable profits available to cover the dividend. A company's distributable profits are its accumulated, realised profits not previously distributed or capitalised, less its accumulated, realised losses not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital. At 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc's distributable profits were \u00a333,134 million.\n\nThe profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of NatWest Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2022 amounted to \u00a33,340 million compared with a profit of \u00a32,950 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, as set out in the consolidated income statement on page 299.\n\nIn 2022 NatWest Group paid an interim dividend of \u00a3364 million, or 3.5p per ordinary share (2021 - \u00a3347 million, or 3p per ordinary share).\n\nIn addition, the company also paid a special dividend of \u00a31,750 million, or 16.8p per ordinary share.\n\nThe company has announced that the directors have recommended a final dividend of \u00a31.0 billion, or 10.0p per ordinary share (2021 - \u00a3844 million or 7.5p per ordinary share). The final dividend recommended by directors is subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023.",

The ex-dividend date will be 16 March 2023.\n\nSubject to the above mentioned condition, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary shares is at the discretion of the Board.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, NatWest Group employed 61,000 people (excluding temporary staff). Details of all related costs are included in Note 3 to the consolidated accounts.\n\n## Employment for disabled persons\n\nNatWest Group makes workplace adjustments to support colleagues with disabilities to succeed. If a colleague becomes disabled NatWest Group will, wherever possible, make adjustments to support them in their existing role or re-deploy them to a more suitable alternative role.\n\nThe NatWest Group Careers site gives comprehensive insights into NatWest Group jobs, culture, locations and application processes. It also hosts a variety of blog content to portray stories of what it is like to work at NatWest Group. The company also makes sure that candidates can easily request any adjustments or help to complete their application or assessment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nNatWest Group's business activities and financial position, the factors likely to affect its future development and performance and its objectives and policies in managing the financial risks to which it is exposed and its capital are discussed in the Business review. The risk factors which could materially affect NatWest Group's future results are set out on pages 403 to 424. NatWest Group's regulatory capital resources and significant developments in 2022 and anticipated future developments are detailed in the Capital, liquidity and funding section on pages 244 to 263. This section also describes NatWest Group's funding and liquidity profile, including changes in key metrics and the build up of liquidity reserves.\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis after assessing the principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence over the twelve months from the date the financial statements are approved.\n\n## UK Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2022 financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the principles set out in the Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure published by UK Finance. The Code sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance. The principles are that NatWest Group and other major UK banks will provide high quality, meaningful and decision-useful disclosures; review and enhance their financial instrument disclosures for key areas of interest to market participants; assess the applicability and relevance of good practice recommendations to their disclosures, acknowledging the importance of such guidance; seek to enhance the comparability of financial statement disclosures across the UK banking sector; and clearly differentiate in their annual reports between information that is audited and information that is unaudited.\n\n## Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) and Disclosures on Expected Credit Losses (DECL) Taskforce recommendations\n\nThe EDTF, established by the Financial Stability Board, published its report 'Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks' in October 2012, with an update in November 2015 covering IFRS 9 expected credit losses (ECL). The DECL Taskforce, jointly established by the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Reporting Council and the Prudential Regulation Authority, published its phase 2 report recommendations in December 2019.\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and Pillar 3 Report reflect EDTF and have regard to DECL Taskforce recommendations.\n\n## Authority to repurchase shares\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2022 shareholders authorised the company to make market purchases of up to 1,122,905,024 ordinary shares. The authority was amended at the General Meeting held on 25 August 2022 to preserve the position as if the share consolidation had not taken place and shareholders will be asked to renew the authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\nThe directors utilised the authority obtained at the 2021 AGM to conduct a share buyback programme (the 'Programme') of up to \u00a3750 million, as announced to the market on 30 July 2021. The Programme's purpose is to reduce the ordinary share capital of NatWest Group. Taking into account the reduction in issued ordinary share capital which occurred as a result of the off-market buyback announced on 19 March 2021, the maximum number of ordinary shares that could be purchased by the company under the Programme was 1,157,583,542.\n\nPhase 1 of the Programme commenced on 2 August 2021 and completed on 18 January 2022. 340,537,460 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3340,537,460) were purchased by the company at an average purchase price of 220.0199p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a3749,250,031. Phase 2 of the Programme commenced on 21 February 2022 and completed on 15 July 2022. A further 346,835,822 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3346,835,822) were purchased by the company at an average purchase price of 216.2406p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a3749,999,999 All of the purchased ordinary shares were cancelled, representing 11.23% of the company's issued ordinary share capital.\n\nOn 6 February 2019 the company held a General Meeting and shareholders approved a special resolution to give the company authority to make off-market purchases of up to 4.99% of its issued ordinary share capital in any 12-month period from HMT (or its nominee) at such times as the directors may determine is appropriate. Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting available at natwestgroup.com. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and amended at the General Meeting held on 25 August 2022 to preserve the position as if the share consolidation had not taken place. Shareholders will be asked to renew the authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\nThe company utilised the authority it obtained at the 2020 AGM to make an off-market purchase of 590,730,325 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3590,730,325) in the company from HMT\n\non 19 March 2021, at a price of 190.50p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a31,125,341,269, representing 4.86% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. The company cancelled 390,730,325 of the purchased ordinary shares and held the remaining 200,000,000 ordinary shares in treasury. The company has used a total of 76,513,524 treasury shares to satisfy the exercise of options and the vesting of share awards under the employee share plans and the balance of ordinary shares held in treasury as at 31 December 2022 was 114,011,084. The figure has been adjusted to reflect the 13 for 14 share consolidation on 30 August 2022.\n\nThe company utilised the authority it obtained at the 2021 AGM to make an off-market purchase of 549,851,147 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3549,851,147) in the company from HMT on 28 March 2022, at a price of 220.5p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a31,212,421,779, representing 4.91% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. The company cancelled all of the purchased ordinary shares.\n\nAt the 2021 Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised the company to make an off-market purchase of preference shares in the company. In December 2021 the company used this authority to purchase 157,546 5.5% cumulative preference shares and 259,314 11% cumulative preference shares. The company cancelled all of the purchased preference shares. Shareholders will be asked to renew the authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\n## Additional information\n\nWhere not provided elsewhere in the Report of the directors, the following additional information is required to be disclosed by Part 6 of Schedule 7 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.\n\nThe rights and obligations attached to the company's ordinary shares and preference shares are set out in our Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or can be found at natwestgroup.com.\n\nThe cumulative preference shares represent less than 0.005% of the total voting rights of the company, the remainder being represented by the ordinary shares.\n\nIn a show of hands at a General Meeting of the company, every holder of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have one vote.\n\nOn a poll, every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have four votes for every share held, and holders of cumulative preference shares shall have one vote for each 25p nominal amount held. The notices of Annual General Meetings and General Meetings specify the deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the meeting.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the company other than certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws). At the 2021 Annual General Meeting, shareholders gave authority to directors to offer a scrip dividend alternative on any dividend paid up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2024. Pursuant to the UK Listing Rules, certain employees of the company require the approval of the company to deal in the company's shares.\n\nThe rules governing the powers of directors, including in relation to issuing or buying back shares and their appointment, are set out in our Articles of Association. It will be proposed at the 2023 Annual General Meeting that the directors' authorities to allot shares under the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act) be renewed. The Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution at a General Meeting of shareholders. The company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. There are no persons holding securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the company. A number of the company's employee share plans include restrictions on transfers of shares while shares are subject to the plans. Note 3 sets out a summary of the plans.\n\nUnder the rules of certain employee share plans, voting rights are exercised by the Trustees of the plan on receipt of participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the Trustee no vote is registered.\n\nFor shares held in the company's other employee share trusts, accordance with investor protection guidelines, the Trustees abstain from voting. The Trustees would take independent advice before accepting any offer in respect of their shareholdings for the company in a takeover bid situation. The Trustees have chosen to waive their entitlement to the dividend on shares held by the Trusts.\n\nA change of control of the company following a takeover bid may cause a number of agreements to which the company is party to take effect, alter or terminate. All of the company's employee share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. In the context of the company as a whole, these agreements are not considered to be significant.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe names and brief biographical details of the current directors are shown on pages 86 to 89.\n\nHoward Davies, Frank Dangeard, Patrick Flynn, Morten Friis, Yasmin Jetha, Katie Murray, Mike Rogers, Alison Rose, Mark Seligman and Lena Wilson all served throughout the year and to the date of signing of the financial statements.\n\nRoisin Donnelly was appointed on 1 October 2022 and Robert Gillespie resigned from the Board on 15 December 2022.\n\nMike Rogers and Morten Friis have confirmed their intention to resign as non-executive directors on 25 April 2023 and 31 July 2023 respectively.\n\nAll directors of the company are required to stand for election or re-election annually by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and, in accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors requires approval by all shareholders and also by independent shareholders. Mr Rogers will not be standing for re-election at the company's 2023 AGM, having confirmed his intention to resign on 25 April 2023.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe interests of the directors in the shares of the company at 31 December 2022 are shown on page 164. None of the directors held an interest in the loan capital of the company or in the shares or loan capital of any of the subsidiary undertakings of the company, during the period from 1 January 2022 to 16 February 2023.",

This authorisation was taken as a precaution only, as the company has a longstanding policy of not making political donations or incurring political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words.\n\nDuring 2022, NatWest Group made no political donations, nor incurred any political expenditure in the UK or EU and it is not proposed that NatWest Group's longstanding policy of not making contributions to any political party be changed. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2023.\n\n## Directors' disclosure to auditors\n\nEach of the directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that:\n\n- a. so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and\n- b. the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act.\n\n## Auditors\n\nErnst & Young LLP (EY LLP) are the auditors and have indicated their willingness to continue in office. A resolution to re-appoint EY LLP as the company's auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Jan Cargill\n\nChief Governance Officer and Company Secretary 16 February 2023\n\nNatWest Group plc is registered in Scotland No. SC45551\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThis statement should be read in conjunction with the responsibilities of the auditor set out in their report on pages 286 to 298.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts. The directors are required to prepare Group financial statements, and as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 have elected to prepare company financial statements, for each financial year in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. They are responsible for preparing financial statements that present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of NatWest Group.\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable; and\n- \u00b7 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of NatWest Group and to enable them to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts complies with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of NatWest Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors' report, Directors' remuneration report and Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website.\n\nThe directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the Strategic report and Directors' report (incorporating the Financial review) include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nIn addition, the directors are of the opinion that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n| Howard Davies      | Alison Rose-Slade DBE         | Katie Murray                  |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Chairman           | Group Chief Executive Officer | Group Chief Financial Officer |\n| 16 February 2023   |                               |                               |\n| Board of directors |                               |                               |\n| Chairman           | Executive directors           | Non-executive directors       |\n| Howard Davies      | Alison Rose-Slade DBE         | Frank Dangeard                |\n|                    | Katie Murray                  | Roisin Donnelly               |\n|                    |                               | Patrick Flynn                 |\n|                    |                               | Morten Friis                  |\n|                    |                               | Yasmin Jetha                  |\n|                    |                               | Mike Rogers                   |\n|                    |                               | Mark Seligman                 |\n|                    |                               | Lena Wilson                   |",

The framework ensures the governance, capabilities and methods are in place to facilitate risk management and decision-making across the organisation.\n\nThe framework ensures that NatWest Group's principal risks which are detailed in this section - are appropriately controlled and managed. It sets out the standards and objectives for risk management as well as defining the division of roles and responsibilities.\n\nThis seeks to ensure a consistent approach to risk management across NatWest Group and its subsidiaries. It aligns risk management with NatWest Group's overall strategic objectives.\n\nThe framework, which is designed and maintained by NatWest Group's independent Risk function, is owned by the Chief Risk Officer. It is reviewed and approved annually by the Board. The framework incorporates risk governance, NatWest Group's three lines of defence operating model and the Risk function's mandate.\n\nRisk appetite, supported by a robust set of principles, policies and practices, defines the levels of tolerance for a variety of risks and provides a structured approach to risk-taking within agreed boundaries.\n\nWhile all NatWest Group colleagues are responsible for managing risk, the Risk function provides oversight and monitoring of risk management activities, including the implementation of the framework and adherence to its supporting policies, standards and operational procedures. The Chief Risk Officer plays an integral role in providing the Board with advice on NatWest Group's risk profile, the performance of its controls and in providing challenge where a proposed business strategy may exceed risk tolerance.\n\nIn addition, there is a process to identify and manage top and emerging threats, which are those that could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. Both top and emerging threats may incorporate aspects of - or correlate to - a number of principal risks and are reported alongside them to the Board on a regular basis.\n\n## Culture\n\nRisk culture is at the heart of NatWest Group's risk management framework and its risk management practice. In 2022, the approach to risk culture was refreshed under the new banner of Intelligent Risk Taking to re-intensify focus on robust risk management behaviours and practices. NatWest Group expects leaders to act as role models for strong risk behaviours and practices building clarity, developing capability and motivating employees to reach the required standards set out in the Intelligent Risk Taking approach. Colleagues are expected to:\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n178\n\n- \uf02d Consistently role-model the values and behaviours in Our Code, based on strong ethical standards which underpin Our Purpose.\n- \uf02d Empower others to take risks aligned to NatWest Group's strategy, explore issues from a fresh perspective, and tackle challenges in new and better ways across organisational boundaries.\n- \uf02d Manage risk in line with appropriate risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Ensure each decision made keeps NatWest Group, colleagues, customers, communities and shareholders safe and secure.\n- \uf02d Understand their role in managing risk, remaining clear and capable, grounded in knowledge of regulatory obligations.\n- \uf02d Consider risk in all actions and decisions.\n- \uf02d Escalate risks and issues early; taking action to mitigate risks and learning from mistakes and near-misses, reporting and communicating these transparently.\n- \uf02d Challenge others' attitudes, ideas and actions.\n\nThe target Intelligent Risk Taking behaviours are embedded in NatWest Group's Critical People Capabilities and are clearly aligned to the core values of inclusive, curious, robust, sustainable and ambitious. These aim to act as an effective basis for a strong risk culture because the Critical People Capabilities form the basis of all recruitment and selection processes.\n\n## T Trraaiinniinngg\n\nEnabling employees to have the capabilities and confidence to manage risk is core to NatWest Group's learning strategy. NatWest Group offers a wide range of learning, both technical and behavioural, across the risk disciplines. This training may be mandatory, role-specific or for personal development. Mandatory learning for all staff is focused on keeping employees, customers and NatWest Group safe. This is easily accessed online and is assigned to each person according to their role and business area. The system allows monitoring at all levels to ensure completion.\n\n## O Ouurr  CCooddee\n\nNatWest Group's conduct guidance, Our Code, provides direction on expected behaviour and sets out the standards of conduct that support the values. The code explains the effect of decisions that are taken and describes the principles that must be followed.\n\nThese principles cover conduct-related issues as well as wider business activities. They focus on desired outcomes, with practical guidelines to align the values with commercial strategy and actions. The embedding of these principles facilitates sound decision-making and a clear focus on good customer outcomes.\n\nWhere appropriate, if conduct falls short of NatWest Group's required standards, the accountability review process is used to assess how this should be reflected in pay outcomes for the individuals concerned (for more information on this process refer to page 144). The NatWest Group remuneration policy ensures that the remuneration arrangements for all employees reflect the principles and standards prescribed by the PRA rulebook and the FCA handbook. Any employee falling short of the expected standards would also be subject to internal disciplinary policies and procedures. If appropriate, the relevant authority would be notified.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk management framework continued Governance\n\n## C Coommmmiitttteeee  ssttrruuccttuurree\n\nThe diagram shows NatWest Group's risk committee structure in 2022 and the main purposes of each committee.\n\n## N NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp  ppllcc  BBooaarrdd\n\nReviews and approves the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework (EWRMF) (including the Group's risk appetite framework) and approves the risk appetite for principal risks.

This supports the embedding of effective risk management throughout the organisation. All roles below the CEO sit within one of the three lines. The CEO ensures the efficient use of resources and the effective management of risks as stipulated in the risk management framework and is therefore considered to be outside the three lines of defence principles.\n\n## First line of defence\n\nThe first line of defence incorporates most roles in NatWest Group, including those in the customer-facing businesses, Technology and Services as well as support functions such as People and Transformation, Legal and Finance.\n\nThe first line of defence is empowered to take risks within the constraints of the risk management framework, policies, risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n\nThe first line of defence is responsible for managing its direct risks, and with the support of specialist functions, it is also responsible for managing its consequential risks, by identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting risks.\n\n## Second line of defence\n\nThe second line of defence comprises the Risk function and is independent of the first line.\n\nThe second line of defence is empowered to design and maintain the risk management framework and its components. It undertakes proactive risk oversight and continuous monitoring activities to confirm that NatWest Group engages in permissible and sustainable risk-taking activities.\n\nThe second line of defence advises on, monitors, challenges, approves and escalates where required and reports on the risktaking activities of the first line, ensuring that these are within the constraints of the risk management framework, policies, risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n\n## Third line of defence\n\nThe third line of defence is the Internal Audit function and is independent of the first and second lines.\n\nThe third line of defence is responsible for providing independent assurance to the Board, its subsidiary legal entity boards and executive management on the overall design and operating effectiveness of the risk management framework and its components. This includes the adequacy and effectiveness of key internal controls, governance and the risk management in place to monitor, manage and mitigate the principal risks to NatWest Group and its subsidiary companies achieving their objectives.\n\nThe third line of defence executes its duties freely and objectively in accordance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' Code of Ethics and International Standards on independence and objectivity.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite defines the type and aggregate level of risk NatWest Group is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plans. Risk appetite supports sound risk-taking, the promotion of robust risk practices and risk behaviours, and is calibrated annually.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n181\n\nFor certain principal risks, risk capacity defines the maximum level of risk NatWest Group can assume before breaching constraints determined by regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, the operational environment, and from a conduct perspective. Establishing risk capacity helps determine where risk appetite should be set, ensuring there is a buffer between internal risk appetite and NatWest Group's ultimate capacity to absorb losses.\n\n## R Riisskk  aappppeettiittee  ffrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nThe risk appetite framework supports effective risk management by promoting sound risk-taking through a structured approach, within agreed boundaries. It also ensures emerging threats and risk-taking activities that might be out of appetite are identified, assessed, escalated and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nTo facilitate this, a detailed annual review of the framework is carried out. The review includes:\n\n- \uf02d Assessing the adequacy of the framework compared to internal and external expectations.\n- \uf02d Ensuring the framework remains effective and acts as a strong control environment for risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Assessing the level of embedding of risk appetite across the organisation.\n\nThe Board reviews and approves the risk appetite framework annually.\n\n## E Essttaabblliisshhiinngg  rriisskk  aappppeettiittee\n\nIn line with the risk appetite framework, risk appetite is maintained across NatWest Group through risk appetite statements. These are in place for all principal risks and describe the extent and type of activities that can be undertaken.\n\nRisk appetite statements consist of qualitative statements of appetite supported by risk limits and triggers that operate as a defence against excessive risk-taking. Risk measures and their associated limits are an integral part of the risk appetite approach and a key part of embedding risk appetite in day-today risk management decisions. A clear tolerance for each principal risk is set in alignment with business activities.\n\nThe annual process of reviewing and updating risk appetite statements is completed alongside the business and financial planning process. This ensures that plans and risk appetite are appropriately aligned.\n\nThe Board sets risk appetite for all principal risks to help ensure NatWest Group is well placed to meet its priorities and longterm targets, even in challenging economic environments. This supports NatWest Group in remaining resilient and secure as it pursues its strategic business objectives.\n\nNatWest Group's risk profile is continually monitored and frequently reviewed. Management focus is concentrated on all principal risks as well as the top and emerging threats that may correlate to them. Risk profile relative to risk appetite is reported regularly to senior management and the Board.\n\nNatWest Group policies directly support the qualitative aspects of risk appetite. They define the qualitative expectations, guidance and standards that stipulate the nature and extent of permissible risk-taking and are consistently applied across NatWest Group and its subsidiaries.",

This provides a common risk language to ensure consistent terminology is used across NatWest Group. The Risk Directory is subject to annual review to ensure it continues to fully reflect the risks that NatWest Group faces.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nMitigation is a critical aspect of ensuring that risk profile remains within risk appetite. Risk mitigation strategies are discussed and agreed within NatWest Group.\n\nWhen evaluating possible strategies, costs and benefits, residual risks (risks that are retained) and secondary risks (those that arise from risk mitigation actions themselves) are also considered. Monitoring and review processes are in place to evaluate results. Early identification, and effective management of changes in legislation and regulation are critical to the successful mitigation of compliance and conduct risk. The effects of all changes are managed to ensure the timely achievement of compliance. Those changes assessed as having a high or medium-high impact are managed more closely. Emerging threats that could affect future results and performance are also closely monitored. Action is taken to mitigate potential risks as and when required. Further in-depth analysis, including the stress testing of exposures, is also carried out.\n\n## Testing and monitoring\n\n## Stress testing\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  ccaappiittaall  mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nStress testing is a key risk management tool and a fundamental component of NatWest Group's approach to capital management. It is used to quantify and evaluate the potential impact of specified changes to risk factors on the financial strength of NatWest Group, including its capital position.\n\nStress testing includes:\n\n- \uf02d Scenario testing, which examines the impact of a hypothetical future state to define changes in risk factors.\n- \uf02d Sensitivity testing, which examines the impact of an incremental change to one or more risk factors.\n\nThe process for stress testing consists of four broad stages:\n\n- \uf02d Identify macro and NatWest Group specific vulnerabilities and risks.\n- \uf02d Define and calibrate scenarios to examine risks and vulnerabilities.\n- \uf02d Formal governance process to agree scenarios.\n- \uf02d Translate scenarios into risk drivers. \uf02d Assess impact to current and projected P&L and balance sheet across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d Aggregate impacts into overall results. \uf02d Results form part of the risk management process.\n- \uf02d Scenario results are used to inform business and capital plans.\n- \uf02d Scenario results are analysed by subject matter experts. Appropriate management actions are then developed.\n\n\uf02d\n\n- Scenario results and management actions are reviewed by the relevant Executive Risk Committees and Board Risk Committees. Approval of scenarios is delegated to the NatWest Group Board Risk Committee by the NatWest Group Board\n\nSpecific activities relating to compliance and conduct, credit and financial crime risks are subject to testing and monitoring by the Stress testing is used widely across NatWest Group. The diagram below summarises key areas of focus.\n\nRisk function. This confirms to both internal and external stakeholders - including the Board, senior management, the customer-facing businesses, Internal Audit and NatWest Group's regulators - that risk policies and procedures are being correctly implemented and that they are operating adequately and effectively. Selected key controls are also reviewed for adequacy and effectiveness. Thematic reviews and targeted reviews are also carried out where relevant to ensure appropriate customer outcomes.\n\nIndependent testing and monitoring is completed on principal risk processes and controls impacting the financial statements within the scope of section 404.\n\nThe Risk Testing & Monitoring Forum assesses and validates the annual plan as well as the ongoing programme of reviews.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n182\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Define scenarios\n\nAssess impact\n\nCalculate results and assess implications\n\nDevelop and agree management actions\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk management framework continued\n\nSpecific areas that involve capital management include:\n\n- \uf02d Strategic financial and capital planning - by assessing the impact of sensitivities and scenarios on the capital plan and capital ratios.\n- \uf02d Risk appetite - by gaining a better understanding of the drivers of, and the underlying risks associated with, risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Risk monitoring - by monitoring the risks and horizonscanning events that could potentially affect NatWest Group's financial strength and capital position.\n- \uf02d Risk mitigation - by identifying actions to mitigate risks, or those that could be taken, in the event of adverse changes to the business or economic environment. Principal risk mitigating actions are documented in NatWest Group's recovery plan.\n\nReverse stress testing is also carried out in order to identify and assess scenarios that would cause NatWest Group's business model to become unviable. Reverse stress testing allows potential vulnerabilities in the business model to be examined more fully.\n\n## Capital sufficiency - going concern forward-looking view\n\nGoing concern capital requirements are examined on a forward-looking basis - including as part of the annual budgeting process - by assessing the resilience of capital adequacy and leverage ratios under hypothetical future states. These assessments include assumptions about regulatory and accounting factors (such as IFRS 9). They incorporate economic variables and key assumptions on balance sheet and P&L drivers, such as impairments, to demonstrate that NatWest Group and its operating subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital. A range of future states are tested. In particular, capital requirements are assessed:\n\n- \uf02d Based on a forecast of future business performance, given expectations of economic and market conditions over the forecast period.\n- \uf02d Based on a forecast of future business performance under adverse economic and market conditions over the forecast period. Scenarios of different severity may be examined.\n\nThe potential impact of normal and adverse economic and market conditions on capital requirements is assessed through stress testing, the results of which are not only used widely across NatWest Group but also by the regulators to set specific capital buffers. NatWest Group takes part in stress tests run by regulatory authorities to test industry-wide vulnerabilities under crystallising global and domestic systemic risks.\n\nStress and peak-to-trough movements are used to help assess the amount of capital NatWest Group needs to hold in stress conditions in accordance with the capital risk appetite framework.\n\n## Internal assessment of capital adequacy\n\nAn internal assessment of material risks is carried out annually to enable an evaluation of the amount, type and distribution of capital required to cover these risks. This is referred to as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The ICAAP consists of a point-in-time assessment of exposures and risks at the end of the financial year together with a forwardlooking stress capital assessment. The ICAAP is approved by the Board and submitted to the PRA.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n183\n\nThe ICAAP is used to form a view of capital adequacy separately to the minimum regulatory requirements. The ICAAP is used by the PRA to assess NatWest Group's specific capital requirements through the Pillar 2 framework.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nNatWest Group has mechanisms to allocate capital across its legal entities and businesses. These aim to optimise the use of capital resources taking into account applicable regulatory requirements, strategic and business objectives and risk appetite. The framework for allocating capital is approved by the CFO with support from the Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\n## Governance\n\nCapital management is subject to substantial review and governance. The Board approves the capital plans, including those for key legal entities and businesses as well as the results of the stress tests relating to those capital plans.\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  lliiqquuiiddiittyy\n\n## Liquidity risk monitoring and contingency planning\n\nA suite of tools is used to monitor, limit and stress test the liquidity and funding risks on the balance sheet. Limit frameworks are in place to control the level of liquidity risk, asset and liability mismatches and funding concentrations. Liquidity and funding risks are reviewed at significant legal entity and business levels daily, with performance reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee on a regular basis. Liquidity Condition Indicators are monitored daily. This ensures any build-up of stress is detected early and the response escalated appropriately through recovery planning.\n\n## Internal assessment of liquidity\n\nUnder the liquidity risk management framework, NatWest Group maintains the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process. This includes assessment of net stressed liquidity outflows under a range of severe but plausible stress scenarios. Each scenario evaluates either an idiosyncratic, market-wide or combined stress event as described in the table below.\n\n| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Idiosyncratic  scenario | The market perceives NatWest Group to be  suffering from a severe stress event, which  results in an immediate assumption of  increased credit risk or concerns over  solvency.                                                                                      |\n| Market-wide  scenario   | A market stress event affecting all  participants in a market through contagion,  potential counterparty failure and other  market risks.

Preparations include:\n\n- \uf02d Developing a series of recovery indicators to provide early warning of potential stress events.\n- \uf02d Clarifying roles, responsibilities and escalation routes to minimise uncertainty or delay.\n- \uf02d Developing a recovery playbook to provide a concise description of the actions required during recovery.\n- \uf02d Detailing a range of options to address different stress conditions.\n- \uf02d Appointing dedicated option owners to reduce the risk of delay and capacity concerns.\n\nThe plan is intended to enable NatWest Group to maintain critical services and products it provides to its customers, maintain its core business lines and operate within risk appetite while restoring NatWest Group's financial condition. It is assessed for appropriateness on an ongoing basis and is updated annually. The plan is reviewed and approved by the Board prior to submission to the PRA each year. Individual recovery plans are also prepared for NatWest Holdings Limited, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International Limited, and NatWest Markets N.V.. These plans detail the recovery options, recovery indicators and escalation routes for each entity.\n\nFire drill simulations of possible recovery events are used to test the effectiveness of NatWest Group and individual legal entity recovery plans. The fire drills are designed to replicate possible financial stress conditions and allow senior management to rehearse the responses and decisions that may be required in an actual stress event. The results and lessons learnt from the fire drills are used to enhance NatWest Group's approach to recovery planning.\n\nUnder the resolution assessment part of the PRA rulebook, NatWest Group is required to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA and publish a summary of this report.\n\nResolution would be implemented if NatWest Group was assessed by the UK authorities to have failed and the appropriate regulator put it into resolution. The process of resolution is owned and implemented by the Bank of England (as the UK resolution authority). NatWest Group ensures ongoing maintenance and enhancements of its resolution capabilities, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n184\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  mmaarrkkeett  rriisskk\n\nNon-traded market risk\n\nNon-traded exposures are reported to the PRA on a quarterly basis. This provides the regulator with an overview of NatWest Group's banking book interest rate exposure. The report includes detailed product information analysed by interest rate driver and other characteristics, including accounting classification, currency and counterparty type.\n\nScenario analysis based on hypothetical adverse scenarios is performed on non-traded exposures as part of the Bank of England and European Banking Authority stress test exercises. NatWest Group also produces an internal scenario analysis as part of its financial planning cycles.\n\nNon-traded exposures are capitalised through the ICAAP. This covers gap risk, basis risk, credit spread risk, pipeline risk, structural foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk, equity risk and accounting volatility risk. The ICAAP is completed with a combination of value and earnings measures. The total nontraded market risk capital requirement is determined by adding the different charges for each sub risk type. The ICAAP methodology captures at least ten years of historical volatility, produced with a 99% confidence level. Methodologies are reviewed by NatWest Group Model Risk and the results are approved by the NatWest Group Technical Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\nNon-traded market risk stress results are combined with those for other risks into the capital plan presented to the Board. The cross-risk capital planning process is conducted once a year, with a planning horizon of five years. The scenario narratives cover both regulatory scenarios and macroeconomic scenarios identified by NatWest Group.\n\nVulnerability-based stress testing begins with the analysis of a portfolio and expresses its key vulnerabilities in terms of plausible vulnerability scenarios under which the portfolio would suffer material losses. These scenarios can be historical, macroeconomic or forward-looking/hypothetical. Vulnerabilitybased stress testing is used for internal management information and is not subject to limits. The results for relevant scenarios are reported to senior management.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nNatWest Group carries out regular market risk stress testing to identify vulnerabilities and potential losses in excess of, or not captured in, value-at-risk. The calculated stresses measure the impact of changes in risk factors on the fair values of the trading portfolios.\n\nNatWest Group conducts historical, macroeconomic and vulnerability-based stress testing. Historical stress testing is a measure that is used for internal management. Using the historical simulation framework employed for value-at-risk, the current portfolio is stressed using historical data since 1 January 2005. This methodology simulates the impact of the 99.9 percentile loss that would be incurred by historical risk factor movements over the period, assuming variable holding periods specific to the risk factors and the businesses.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk management framework continued\n\nHistorical stress tests form part of the market risk limit framework and their results are reported regularly to senior management.

This included commodity market and associated inflationary pressures, supply chain impacts, financial sector linkages and broader knock-on impacts to the UK labour and asset markets. Impacts on operational aspects to NatWest Group were also considered.\n\nApplying the macro-scenarios to NatWest Group's earnings, capital, liquidity and funding positions did not result in a breach of any regulatory thresholds.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n185\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  ssttrreessss  tteessttiinngg\n\nThe Bank of England returned to the annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test framework in 2022 and published the scenario on 26 September 2022. This follows two years of COVID-19 crisis-related stress testing and the decision to postpone the test in March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. NatWest Group has participated in this stress test and the results will be published in summer 2023 and, along with other relevant information, will be used to help inform NatWest Group capital buffers (both the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate and PRA buffers).\n\nThe 2022 stress test aims to assess the impact of a UK and global macroeconomic stress on UK banks, spanning a fiveyear period from Q3 2022 to Q2 2027. It is a coherent 'tail risk' scenario designed to be severe and broad enough to assess the resilience of UK banks to a range of adverse shocks.\n\nThe stress scenario is broadly similar to the 2019 ACS and more severe overall than the global financial crisis, with the key difference being elevated levels of inflation. Annual UK inflation averages around 11% over the first three years of the scenario, while peaking at 17% in early 2023 and does not begin to fall until the second half of the year.\n\nThe stress is based on an end-of-June 2022 balance sheet starting position.\n\nFurther details on the scenario and ACS stress test can be found at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/stresstesting/2022/key-elements-of-the-2022-stress-test\n\nFollowing the UK's exit from the European Union on 31 December 2020, only relevant European subsidiaries of NatWest Group will take part in the European Banking Authority stress tests going forward.

NatWest Group is also exposed to settlement risk through foreign exchange, trade finance and payments activities.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d Across both Personal and Wholesale, the credit profile remains stable, but the outlook is uncertain from inflationary pressure, compounded by rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions. NatWest Group has yet to see signs of financial stress materially affecting customers' ability to repay.\n- \uf02d Expected credit loss (ECL) reduced during 2022, reflecting the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank RoI, plus continued positive trends in portfolio performance alongside a related net release of judgemental post model adjustments and write-off activity. Overall, ECL coverage decreased due to the withdrawal, a change in product mix and a reduction in judgemental post model adjustments which more than offset increases from the deteriorating economic outlook.\n- \uf02d Personal lending grew as a result of strong mortgage and resilient unsecured lending demand. Personal lending criteria were unwound to a level similar to pre-COVID-19 norms during 2022. Affordability assumptions remain under continuous review and adjustments were made to ensure new business continues to be assessed appropriately.\n- \uf02d In Wholesale, balance sheet reduction in 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to a decrease in central items held in the course of treasury related management activities. There was growth in Commercial & Institutional. Sector appetite is reviewed regularly and where appropriate adjusted for those sectors most affected by current economic and geopolitical conditions.\n- \uf02d A number of high materiality IFRS 9 models were redeveloped in 2022, most notably all probability of default (PD) and some loss given default (LGD) models for Personal lending and the two most material economic response models for Wholesale lending.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group continued to progress embedding climate change considerations in credit assessment and monitoring, including scenario analysis to assess the materiality of climate change risks.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nThe Credit Risk function provides oversight and challenge of frontline credit risk management activities.\n\n## Governance activities include:\n\n- \uf02d Defining credit risk appetite measures for the management of concentration risk and credit policy to establish the key causes of risk in the process of providing credit and the controls that must be in place to mitigate them.\n- \uf02d Approving and monitoring operational limits for business segments and credit limits for customers.\n- \uf02d Oversight of the first line of defence to ensure that credit risk remains within the appetite set by the Board and that controls are being operated adequately and effectively.\n- \uf02d Assessing the adequacy of ECL provisions including approving key IFRS 9 inputs (such as significant increase in credit risk (SICR) thresholds) and any necessary in-model and post model adjustments through NatWest Group and business unit provisions and model committees. \uf02d Development and approval of credit grading models.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n186\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nCredit risk appetite aligns to the strategic risk appetite set by the Board and is set and monitored through risk appetite frameworks tailored to NatWest Group's Personal and Wholesale segments.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nThe Personal credit risk appetite framework sets limits that control the quality and concentration of both existing and new business for each relevant business segment.\n\nThese risk appetite measures consider the segments' ability to grow sustainably and the level of losses expected under stress. Credit risk is further controlled through operational limits specific to customer or product characteristics.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nFor Wholesale credit, the framework has been designed to reflect factors that influence the ability to operate within risk appetite. Tools such as stress testing and economic capital are used to measure credit risk volatility and develop links between the framework and risk appetite limits.\n\nFour formal frameworks are used, classifying, measuring and monitoring credit risk exposure across single name, sector and country concentrations and product and asset classes with heightened risk characteristics.\n\nThe framework is supported by a suite of transactional acceptance standards that set out the risk parameters within which businesses should operate.\n\nCredit policy standards are in place for both the Wholesale and Personal portfolios. They are expressed as a set of mandatory controls.\n\n## Identification and measurement\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  sstteewwaarrddsshhiipp (audited)\n\nRisks are identified through relationship management and credit stewardship of customers and portfolios. Credit risk stewardship takes place throughout the customer relationship, beginning with the initial approval. It includes the application of credit assessment standards, credit risk mitigation and collateral, ensuring that credit documentation is complete and appropriate, carrying out regular portfolio or customer reviews and problem debt identification and management.\n\n## A Asssseett  qquuaalliittyy (audited)\n\nAll credit grades map to an asset quality (AQ) scale, used for financial reporting. This AQ scale is based on Basel probability of defaults. Performing loans are defined as AQ1-AQ9 (where the PD is less than 100%) and defaulted non-performing loans as AQ10 or Stage 3 under IFRS 9 (where the PD is 100%). Loans are defined as defaulted when the payment status becomes 90 days past due, or earlier if there is clear evidence that the borrower is unlikely to repay, for example bankruptcy or insolvency.\n\n## C Coouunntteerrppaarrttyy  ccrreeddiitt  rriisskk\n\nCounterparty credit risk arises from the obligations of customers under derivative and securities financing transactions.\n\nNatWest Group mitigates counterparty credit risk through collateralisation and netting agreements, which allow amounts owed by NatWest Group to a counterparty to be netted against amounts the counterparty owes NatWest Group.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued Mitigation\n\nMitigation techniques, as set out in the appropriate credit policies and transactional acceptance standards, are used in the management of credit portfolios across NatWest Group. These techniques mitigate credit concentrations in relation to an individual customer, a borrower group or a collection of related borrowers. Where possible, customer credit balances are netted against obligations. Mitigation tools can include structuring a security interest in a physical or financial asset, the use of credit derivatives including credit default swaps, credit-linked debt instruments and securitisation structures, and the use of guarantees and similar instruments (for example, credit insurance) from related and third parties.\n\nProperty is used to mitigate credit risk across a number of portfolios, in particular residential mortgage lending and commercial real estate (CRE).\n\nThe valuation methodologies for collateral in the form of residential mortgage property and CRE are detailed below.\n\nResidential mortgages NatWest Group takes collateral in the form of residential property to mitigate the credit risk arising from mortgages. NatWest Group values residential property individually during the loan underwriting process, either by obtaining an appraisal by a suitably qualified appraiser (for example, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)) or using a statistically valid model. In both cases, a sample of the valuation outputs are periodically reviewed by an independent RICS qualified appraiser. NatWest Group updates Retail Banking UK residential property values quarterly using country (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) or English regional specific Office for National Statistics House Price indices.\n\nWithin the Private Banking and RBSI segments, properties securing loans greater than \u00a32.5 million or \u20ac3 million are revalued every three years.\n\nThe current indexed value of the property is a component of the ECL provisioning calculation.\n\nCommercial real estate valuations - NatWest Group has an actively managed panel of chartered surveying firms that cover the spectrum of geography and property sectors in which NatWest Group takes collateral. Suitable RICS registered valuers for particular assets are typically contracted through a service agreement to ensure consistency of quality and advice. In the UK, an independent third-party market indexation is applied to update external valuations for commercial property once they are more than a year old. For obligations in excess of \u00a32.5 million and where the charged property has a book value in excess of \u00a30.5 million, a formal valuation review is commissioned at least every three years. In the Republic of Ireland, assets are revalued in line with the Central Bank of Ireland threshold requirements, which permits indexation for lower value residential assets, but demands regular valuations for higher value assets.\n\n## Assessment and monitoring\n\nPractices for credit stewardship - including credit assessment, approval and monitoring as well as the identification and management of problem debts - differ between the Personal and Wholesale portfolios.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n187\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nPersonal customers are served through a lending approach that entails offering a large number of small-value loans. To ensure that these lending decisions are made consistently, NatWest Group analyses internal credit information as well as external data supplied by credit reference agencies (including historical debt servicing behaviour of customers with respect to both NatWest Group and other lenders). NatWest Group then sets its lending rules accordingly, developing different rules for different products.\n\nThe process is then largely automated, with each customer receiving an individual credit score that reflects both internal and external behaviours and this score is compared with the lending rules set. For relatively high-value, complex personal loans, including some residential mortgage lending, specialist credit managers make the final lending decisions. These decisions are made within specified delegated authority limits that are issued dependent on the experience of the individual.\n\nUnderwriting standards and portfolio performance are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain adequate in the current market environment and are not weakened materially to sustain growth.\n\nThe actual performance of each portfolio is tracked relative to operational limits. The limits apply to a range of credit riskrelated measures including projected credit default rates across products and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the mortgage portfolios. Where operational limits identify areas of concern management action is taken to adjust credit or business strategy.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nWholesale customers - including corporates, banks and other financial institutions - are grouped by industry sectors and geography as well as by product/asset class and are managed on an individual basis. Customers are aggregated as a single risk when sufficiently interconnected.\n\nA credit assessment is carried out before credit facilities are made available to customers. The assessment process is dependent on the complexity of the transaction. Credit approvals are subject to environmental, social and governance risk policies which restrict exposure to certain highly carbon intensive industries as well as those with potentially heightened reputational impacts. Customer specific climate risk commentary is now mandatory.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, a new framework was introduced to categorise clients in a consistent manner across the Wholesale portfolio, based on the effect of COVID-19 on their financial position and outlook in relation to the sector risk appetite. This framework has been retained, updated and aligned with the Risk of Credit Loss framework (further details below) to consider viability impacts more generally beyond those directly related to COVID-19 and classification via the framework is now mandatory and must be refreshed at least annually. The framework extends to all Wholesale borrowing customers in assessing whether customers exhibit a SICR, if support is considered to be granting forbearance and the time it would take for customers to return to operating within transactional acceptance standards.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk continued\n\nFor lower risk transactions below specific thresholds, credit decisions can be approved through self-sanctioning within the business. This process is facilitated through an auto-decision making system, which utilises scorecards, strategies and policy rules.\n\nFor all other transactions, credit is only granted to customers following joint approval by an approver from the business and the credit risk function or by two credit officers. The joint business and credit approvers act within a delegated approval authority under the Wholesale Credit Authorities Framework Policy. The level of delegated authority held by approvers is dependent on their experience and expertise with only a small number of senior executives holding the highest approval authority. Both business and credit approvers are accountable for the quality of each decision taken, although the credit risk approver holds ultimate sanctioning authority.\n\nTransactional acceptance standards provide detailed transactional lending and risk acceptance metrics and structuring guidance. As such, these standards provide a mechanism to manage risk appetite at the customer/transaction level and are supplementary to the established credit risk appetite.\n\nCredit grades (PD) and LGD are reviewed and if appropriate reapproved annually. The review process assesses borrower performance, including reconfirmation or adjustment of risk parameter estimates; the adequacy of security; compliance with terms and conditions; and refinancing risk.\n\n## Problem debt management\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\n## Early problem identification\n\nPre-emptive triggers are in place to help identify customers that may be at risk of being in financial difficulty. These triggers are both internal, using NatWest Group data, and external using information from credit reference agencies. Proactive contact is then made with the customer to establish if they require help with managing their finances. By adopting this approach, the aim is to prevent a customer's financial position deteriorating which may then require intervention from the Collections and Recoveries teams.\n\nPersonal customers experiencing financial difficulty are managed by the Collections team. If the Collections team is unable to provide appropriate support after discussing suitable options with the customer, management of that customer moves to the Recoveries team. If at any point in the collections and recoveries process, the customer is identified as being potentially vulnerable, the customer will be separated from the regular process and supported by a specialist team to ensure the customer receives appropriate support for their circumstances.\n\n## Collections\n\nWhen a customer exceeds an agreed limit or misses a regular monthly payment the customer is contacted by NatWest Group and requested to remedy the position. If the situation is not regularised then, where appropriate, the Collections team will become more involved and the customer will be supported by skilled debt management staff who endeavour to provide customers with bespoke solutions. Solutions include short-term account restructuring, refinance loans and forbearance which can include interest suspension and 'breathing space'. All treatments available to customers experiencing financial difficulties are reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate for customers impacted by current economic conditions.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n188\n\nIn the event that an affordable and sustainable agreement with a customer cannot be reached, the debt will transition to the Recoveries team.\n\nFor provisioning purposes, under IFRS 9, exposure to customers managed by the Collections team is categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment, unless it is 90 days past due or has triggered any other unlikeliness to pay indicators, in which case it is categorised as Stage 3.\n\n## Recoveries\n\nThe Recoveries team will issue a notice of intention to default to the customer and, if appropriate, a formal demand, while also registering the account with credit reference agencies where appropriate. Following this, the customer's debt may then be placed with a third-party debt collection agency, or alternatively a solicitor, in order to agree an affordable repayment plan with the customer. An option that may also be considered, is the sale of unsecured debt. Exposures subject to formal debt recovery are defaulted and, under IFRS 9, categorised as Stage 3.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\n## Early problem identification\n\nEach segment and sector have defined early warning indicators to identify customers experiencing financial difficulty, and to increase monitoring if needed. Early warning indicators may be internal, such as a customer's bank account activity, or external, such as a publicly-listed customer's share price. If early warning indicators show a customer is experiencing potential or actual difficulty, or if relationship managers or credit officers identify other signs of financial difficulty, they may decide to classify the customer within the Risk of Credit Loss framework. Broader macro-economic trends including commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and consumer and government spend are also tracked, helping inform decisions on sector risk appetite. Customer level early warning indicators are regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with prevailing economic conditions, ensuring both the volume and focus of alerts is aligned to the point-in-time risk within each sector.\n\n## The aligned Risk of Credit Loss and viability framework\n\nThis framework focuses on all Wholesale customers to provide early identification of credit deterioration, support intelligent risk-taking, ensure fair and consistent customer outcomes and provide key insights into Wholesale lending portfolios. Expert judgment is applied by experienced credit risk officers to classify cases into categories that reflect progressively deteriorating credit risk to NatWest Group. There are two classifications in the framework that apply to non-defaulted customers who are in financial stress - Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss. For the purposes of provisioning, all exposures categorised as Heightened Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment. The framework also applies to those customers that have met NatWest Group's default criteria (AQ10 exposures). Defaulted exposures are categorised as Stage 3 impaired for provisioning purposes.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers are performing customers that have met certain characteristics, which have led to significant credit deterioration. Collectively, characteristics reflect circumstances that may affect the customer's ability to meet repayment obligations. Characteristics include trading issues, covenant breaches, material PD downgrades and past due facilities.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers require pre-emptive actions (outside the customer's normal trading patterns) to return or maintain their facilities within NatWest Group's current risk appetite.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nRisk of Credit Loss customers are performing customers that have met the criteria for Heightened Monitoring and also pose a risk of credit loss to NatWest Group in the next 12 months should mitigating action not be taken or not be successful.\n\nOnce classified as either Heightened Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss, a number of mandatory actions are taken in accordance with policies. Actions include a review of the customer's credit grade, facility and security documentation and the valuation of security. Depending on the severity of the financial difficulty and the size of the exposure, the customer relationship strategy is reassessed by credit officers, by specialist credit risk or relationship management units in the relevant business, or by Restructuring.\n\nAgreed customer management strategies are regularly monitored by both the business and credit teams. The largest Risk of Credit Loss exposures are regularly reviewed by a Risk of Credit Loss forum. The forum members are experienced credit, business and restructuring specialists. The purpose of the forum is to review and challenge the strategies undertaken for customers that pose the largest risk of credit loss to NatWest Group.\n\nAppropriate corrective action is taken when circumstances emerge that may affect the customer's ability to service its debt (refer to Heightened Monitoring characteristics). Corrective actions may include granting a customer various types of concessions. Any decision to approve a concession will be a function of specific appetite, the credit quality of the customer, the market environment and the loan structure and security. All customers granted forbearance are classified Heightened Monitoring as a minimum.\n\nOther potential outcomes of the relationship review are to: return the customer to a satisfactory status, offer additional lending and continue monitoring, transfer the relationship to Restructuring if appropriate, or exit the relationship.\n\nThe aligned Risk of Credit Loss and viability framework does not apply to problem debt management for business banking customers. These customers are, where necessary, managed by specialist problem debt management teams, depending on the size of exposure or by the business banking recoveries team where a loan has been impaired.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nWhere customers are categorised as Risk of Credit Loss and the lending exposure is above \u00a31 million, relationships are supported by the Restructuring team. The objective of Restructuring is to protect NatWest Group's capital. Restructuring does this by working with corporate and commercial customers in financial difficulty to help them understand their options and how their restructuring or repayment strategies can be delivered. Helping viable customers return to financial health and restoring a normal banking relationship is always the preferred outcome, however, where this is not possible, NatWest Group will work with customers to achieve a solvent outcome. Throughout this period, the mainstream relationship manager will remain an integral part of the customer relationship. Insolvency is considered as a last resort and if deemed necessary, NatWest Group will work to recover its capital in a fair and efficient manner, while upholding the fair treatment of customers and NatWest Group's core values.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n189\n\n## Forbearance (audited)\n\nForbearance takes place when a concession is made on the contractual terms of a loan/debt in response to a customer's financial difficulties.\n\nThe aim of forbearance is to support and restore the customer to financial health while minimising risk. To ensure that forbearance is appropriate for the needs of the customer, minimum standards are applied when assessing, recording, monitoring and reporting forbearance.\n\nA credit exposure may be forborne more than once, generally where a temporary concession has been granted and circumstances warrant another temporary or permanent revision of the loan's terms.\n\nLoans are reported as forborne until they meet the exit criteria as detailed in the appropriate regulatory guidance. These include being classified as performing for two years since the last forbearance event, making regular repayments and the loan/debt being less than 30 days past due.\n\n## T Tyyppeess  ooff  ffoorrbbeeaarraannccee\n\n## Personal\n\nIn the Personal portfolio, forbearance may involve payment concessions and loan rescheduling (including extensions in contractual maturity), capitalisation of arrears. Forbearance support is provided for both mortgages and unsecured lending.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nIn the Wholesale portfolio, forbearance may involve covenant waivers, amendments to margins, payment concessions and loan rescheduling (including extensions in contractual maturity), capitalisation of arrears, and debt forgiveness or debt-for-equity swaps.\n\n## M Moonniittoorriinngg  ooff  ffoorrbbeeaarraannccee\n\n## Personal\n\nFor Personal portfolios, forborne loans are separated and regularly monitored and reported while the forbearance strategy is implemented, until they exit forbearance.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nIn the Wholesale portfolio, customer PDs and facility LGDs are reassessed prior to finalising any forbearance arrangement. The ultimate outcome of a forbearance strategy is highly dependent on the co-operation of the borrower and a viable business or repayment outcome. Where forbearance is no longer appropriate, NatWest Group will consider other options such as the enforcement of security, insolvency proceedings or both, although these are options of last resort.\n\nProvisioning requirements on forbearance are detailed in the Provisioning for forbearance section.\n\n## Credit grading models\n\nCredit grading models is the collective term used to describe all models, frameworks and methodologies used to calculate PD, exposure at default (EAD), LGD, maturity and the production of credit grades.\n\nCredit grading models are designed to provide:\n\n- \uf02d An assessment of customer and transaction characteristics.\n- \uf02d A meaningful differentiation of credit risk.\n- \uf02d Accurate internal default rate, loss and exposure estimates that are used in the capital calculation or wider risk management purposes.",

Regulatory conservatism within the Basel models has been removed as appropriate to comply with the IFRS 9 requirement for unbiased ECL estimates.\n\nFive key areas may materially influence the measurement of credit impairment under IFRS 9 - two of these relate to model build and three relate to model application:\n\n## Model build:\n\n- \uf02d The determination of economic indicators that have most influence on credit loss for each portfolio and the severity of impact (this leverages existing stress testing models which are reviewed annually).\n- \uf02d The build of term structures to extend the determination of the risk of loss beyond 12 months that will influence the impact of lifetime loss for exposures in Stage 2.\n\n## Model application:\n\n- \uf02d The assessment of the SICR and the formation of a framework capable of consistent application.\n- \uf02d The determination of asset lifetimes that reflect behavioural characteristics while also representing management actions and processes (using historical data and experience).\n- \uf02d The choice of forward-looking economic scenarios and their respective probability weights.\n\nRefer to Accounting policy 2.3 for further details.\n\n## I IFFRRSS  99  EECCLL  mmooddeell  ddeessiiggnn  pprriinncciipplleess (audited)\n\nModelling of ECL for IFRS 9 follows the conventional approach to divide the estimation of credit losses into its component parts of PD, LGD and EAD.\n\nTo meet IFRS 9 requirements, the PD, LGD and EAD parameters differ from their Pillar 1 internal ratings based (IRB) counterparts in the following aspects:\n\n- \uf02d Unbiased - material regulatory conservatism has been removed from IFRS 9 parameters to produce unbiased estimates.\n- \uf02d Point-in-time - IFRS 9 parameters reflect actual economic conditions at the reporting date instead of long-run average or downturn conditions.\n- \uf02d Forward-looking - IFRS 9 PD estimates and, where appropriate, EAD and LGD estimates reflect forward-looking economic conditions.\n- \uf02d Lifetime measurement - IFRS 9 PD, LGD and EAD are provided as multi-period term structures up to exposure lifetimes instead of over a fixed one-year horizon.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the PD over the remaining lifetime at the reporting date) and the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nFor assets originated before IFRS 9 was introduced, comparable lifetime origination PDs did not exist. These have been retrospectively created using the relevant model inputs applicable at initial recognition.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n190\n\n## P PDD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\n## Personal models\n\nPersonal PD models follow a discrete multi-horizon survival approach, predicting quarterly PDs up to lifetime at account level, with a key driver being scores from related IRB PD models. Forward-looking economic information is brought in by economic response models, which leverage the existing stress test model suite. The current suite of PD models was introduced in 2022 replacing the previous, first-generation models to remediate a range of model weaknesses.\n\n## Wholesale models\n\nWholesale PD models use a point-in-time/through-the-cycle framework to convert one-year regulatory PDs into point-intime estimates that reflect economic conditions at the reporting date. The framework utilises credit cycle indices (CCIs) for a comprehensive set of region/industry segments. Further detail on CCIs is provided in the Economic loss drivers section.\n\nOne year point-in-time PDs are extended to forward-looking lifetime PDs using a conditional transition matrix approach and a set of econometric forecasting models.\n\n## L LGGDD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\nThe general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models is to leverage corresponding IRB LGD models with bespoke adjustments to ensure estimates are unbiased and, where relevant, forwardlooking.\n\n## Personal\n\nForward-looking information has only been incorporated for the secured portfolios, where changes in property prices can be readily accommodated. Analysis has shown minimal impact of economic conditions on LGDs for the other Personal portfolios.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nForward-looking economic information is incorporated into LGD estimates using the existing CCI framework. For low default portfolios, including sovereigns and banks, loss data is too scarce to substantiate estimates that vary with economic conditions. Consequently, for these portfolios, LGD estimates are assumed to be constant throughout the projection horizon.\n\n## E EAADD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\n## Personal\n\nThe IFRS 9 Personal modelling approach for EAD is dependent on product type.\n\n- \uf02d Revolving products use the existing Basel models as a basis, with appropriate adjustments incorporating a term structure based on time to default.\n- \uf02d Amortising products use an amortising schedule, where a formula is used to calculate the expected balance based on remaining terms and interest rates.\n\nAnalysis has indicated that there is minimal impact on EAD arising from changes in the economy for all Personal portfolios except mortgages. Therefore, forward-looking information is only incorporated in the mortgage EAD model (through forecast changes in interest rates).\n\n## Wholesale\n\nFor Wholesale, EAD values are projected using product specific credit conversion factors (CCFs), closely following the product segmentation and approach of the respective Basel model. However, the CCFs are estimated over multi-year time horizons and contain no regulatory conservatism or downturn assumptions.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nNo explicit forward-looking information is incorporated, on the basis of analysis showing the temporal variation in CCFs is mainly attributable to changes in exposure management practices rather than economic conditions.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee  aanndd  ppoosstt  mmooddeell  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss (audited)\n\nThe IFRS 9 PD, EAD and LGD models are subject to NatWest Group's model risk policy that stipulates periodic model monitoring, periodic re-validation and defines approval procedures and authorities according to model materiality. Various post model adjustments were applied where management judged they were necessary to ensure an adequate level of overall ECL provision. All post model adjustments were subject to formal approval through provisioning governance, and were categorised as follows (business level commentary is provided below):\n\n- \uf02d Deferred model calibrations - ECL adjustments where PD model monitoring indicated that actual defaults were below estimated levels but where it was judged that an implied ECL release was not supportable due to the influence of government support schemes on default levels in the past two years. As a consequence, any potential ECL release was deferred and retained on the balance sheet until modelled ECL levels are affirmed by new model parallel runs or similar analyses.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n191\n\n- \uf02d Economic uncertainty - ECL adjustments primarily arising from uncertainties associated with the high inflation environment as well as supply chain disruption, along with the residual effect of COVID-19 and government support schemes. In all cases, management judged that additional ECL was required until further credit performance data became available as the full effects of these issues matures.\n- \uf02d Other adjustments - ECL adjustments where it was judged that the modelled ECL required amendment.\n\nPost model adjustments will remain a key focus area of NatWest Group's ongoing ECL adequacy assessment process. A holistic framework has been established including reviewing a range of economic data, external benchmark information and portfolio performance trends with a particular focus on segments of the portfolio (both commercial and consumer) that are likely to be more susceptible to the high inflation environment and supply chain disruption.",

This adjustment superseded the previously held \u00a326 million for COVID-19 payment holiday highrisk customers and the \u00a369 million judgemental ECL release holdback at 31 December 2021. The current post model adjustment allocates more ECL to Stage 1 given the forwardlooking nature of the risks on affordability driven by the high inflation environment, whereas the previous COVID-19 post model adjustments were focused on Stage 2, due to specific customer events (for example, high-risk payment holiday cases migrated into Stage 2).\n\nOther judgmental overlays included a \u00a320 million uplift to reflect forward-looking provisions relating to credit cards EAD and limit utilisation modelling considerations. There is also an ECL adjustment for higher risk residential interest only mortgages of \u00a37 million. The \u00a314 million post model adjustment previously held for cladding risk was removed due to management's view on the positive developments in this segment.\n\nCommercial & Institutional - The post model adjustment for economic uncertainty reduced from \u00a3391 million to \u00a3191 million during the year. It included an overlay of \u00a3108 million to cover the residual risks from COVID-19, including the risk that government support schemes could affect future recoveries and concerns surrounding associated debt, to customers that have utilised government support schemes. Inflation and supply chain issues present significant headwinds for a number of sectors which are not fully captured in the models. An \u00a383 million mechanistic adjustment, via a sector-level downgrade, was applied to the sectors that were considered most at risk from these headwinds.\n\nThe judgemental overlay for deferred model calibrations on the business banking portfolio was removed as COVID-19 no longer impedes the mechanistic modelling approach.\n\nOther adjustments included an overlay of \u00a313 million to mitigate the effect of operational timing delays in the identification and flagging of a SICR.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n193\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) (audited)\n\nExposures that are considered significantly credit deteriorated since initial recognition are classified in Stage 2 and assessed for lifetime ECL measurement (exposures not considered deteriorated carry a 12 month ECL). NatWest Group has adopted a framework to identify deterioration based primarily on relative movements in lifetime PD supported by additional qualitative backstops. The principles applied are consistent across NatWest Group and align to credit risk management practices, where appropriate.\n\nThe framework comprises the following elements:\n\n- \uf02d IFRS 9 lifetime PD assessment (the primary driver) - on modelled portfolios, the assessment is based on the relative deterioration in forward-looking lifetime PD and is assessed monthly. To assess whether credit deterioration has occurred, the residual lifetime PD at balance sheet date (which PD is established at date of initial recognition (DOIR)) is compared to the current PD. If the current lifetime PD exceeds the residual origination PD by more than a threshold amount, deterioration is assumed to have occurred and the exposure transferred into Stage 2 for a lifetime loss assessment. For Wholesale, a doubling of PD would indicate a SICR subject to a minimum PD uplift of 0.1%. For Personal portfolios, the criteria vary by risk band, with lower risk exposures needing to deteriorate more than higher risk exposures, as outlined in the following table:\n\n| Personal  risk bands   | PD bandings (based  on residual lifetime PD calculated at  DOIR)   | PD deterioration  threshold criteria   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Risk band A            | <0.762%                                                            | PD@DOIR + 1%                           |\n| Risk band B            | <4.306%                                                            | PD@DOIR + 3%                           |\n| Risk band C            | >=4.306%                                                           | 1.7 x PD@DOIR                          |\n\n- \uf02d Qualitative high-risk backstops - the PD assessment is complemented with the use of qualitative high-risk backstops to further inform whether significant deterioration in lifetime risk of default has occurred. The qualitative high-risk backstop assessment includes the use of the mandatory 30+ days past due backstop, as prescribed by IFRS 9 guidance, and other features such as forbearance support, Wholesale exposures managed within the Risk of Credit Loss framework, and adverse credit bureau results for Personal customers.\n- \uf02d Persistence (Personal and business banking customers only)\n- - the persistence rule ensures that accounts which have met the criteria for PD driven deterioration are still considered to be significantly deteriorated for three months thereafter. This additional rule enhances the timeliness of capture in Stage 2. The persistence rule is applied to PD driven deterioration only.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk continued\n\nThe criteria are based on a significant amount of empirical analysis and seek to meet three key objectives:\n\n- \uf02d Criteria effectiveness - the criteria should be effective in identifying significant credit deterioration and prospective default population.\n- \uf02d Stage 2 stability - the criteria should not introduce unnecessary volatility in the Stage 2 population.\n- \uf02d Portfolio analysis - the criteria should produce results which are intuitive when reported as part of the wider credit portfolio.\n\nMonitoring the effect on relative PD deterioration when originating new lending at times of weaker economic outlook (therefore, higher PDs at initial recognition) is important to ensure SICR criteria remains effective.\n\n## Provisioning for forbearance (audited)\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nThe methodology used for provisioning in respect of Personal forborne loans will differ depending on whether the loans are performing or non-performing and which business is managing them due to local market conditions.\n\nGranting forbearance will only change the arrears status of the loan in specific circumstances, which can include capitalisation of principal and interest in arrears, where the loan may be returned to the performing book if the customer has demonstrated an ability to meet regular payments and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nThe loan would continue to be reported as forborne until it meets the exit criteria set out by the appropriate regulatory guidance.\n\nFor ECL provisioning, all forborne but performing exposures are categorised as Stage 2 and are subject to a lifetime loss provisioning assessment. Where the forbearance treatment includes the cessation of interest on the customer balance (i.e. non-accrual), this will be treated as a Stage 3 default.\n\nFor non-performing forborne loans, the Stage 3 loss assessment process is the same as for non-forborne loans.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nProvisions for forborne loans are assessed in accordance with normal provisioning policies. The customer's financial position and prospects - as well as the likely effect of the forbearance, including any concessions granted, and revised PD or LGD gradings - are considered in order to establish whether an impairment provision increase is required.\n\nWholesale loans granted forbearance are individually credit assessed in most cases. Performing loans subject to forbearance treatment are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment.\n\nForbearance may result in the value of the outstanding debt exceeding the present value of the estimated future cash flows. This difference will lead to a customer being classified as nonperforming.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n194\n\nIn the case of non-performing forborne loans, an individual loan impairment provision assessment generally takes place prior to forbearance being granted. The amount of the loan impairment provision may change once the terms of the forbearance are known, resulting in an additional provision charge or a release of the provision in the period the forbearance is granted.\n\nThe transfer of Wholesale loans from impaired to performing status follows assessment by relationship managers and credit. When no further losses are anticipated and the customer is expected to meet the loan's revised terms, any provision is written-off or released and the balance of the loan can be returned to performing status once exit criteria, as set out by regulatory guidance, is met.\n\n## Asset lifetimes (audited)\n\nThe choice of initial recognition and asset duration is another critical judgment in determining the quantum of lifetime losses that apply.\n\n- \uf02d The date of initial recognition reflects the date that a transaction (or account) was first recognised on the balance sheet; the PD recorded at that time provides the baseline used for subsequent determination of SICR as detailed above.\n- \uf02d For asset duration, the approach applied (in line with IFRS 9 requirements) is:\n- \uf02d Term lending - the contractual maturity date, reduced for behavioural trends where appropriate (such as, expected prepayment and amortisation).\n- \uf02d Revolving facilities - for Personal portfolios (except credit cards), asset duration is based on behavioural life and this is normally greater than contractual life (which would typically be overnight). For Wholesale portfolios, asset duration is based on annual customer review schedules and will be set to the next review date.\n\nIn the case of credit cards, the most significant judgment is to reflect the operational practice of card reissuance and the associated credit assessment as enabling a formal reorigination trigger. As a consequence, a capped lifetime approach of up to 36 months is used on credit card balances. If the approach was uncapped the ECL impact is estimated at approximately \u00a380 million (2021 - \u00a370 million). However, credit card balances originated under the 0% balance transfer product, and representing approximately 19% of performing card balances, have their ECL calculated on a behavioural lifetime approach as opposed to being capped at a maximum of three years.\n\nThe capped approach reflects NatWest Group practice of a credit-based review of customers prior to credit card issuance and complies with IFRS 9. Benchmarking information indicates that peer UK banks use behavioural approaches in the main for credit card portfolios with average durations between three and ten years. Across Europe, durations are shorter and are, in some cases, as low as one year.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Economic loss drivers (audited)\n\n## I Innttrroodduuccttiioonn\n\nThe portfolio segmentation and selection of economic loss drivers for IFRS 9 follow closely the approach used in stress testing. To enable robust modelling the forecasting models for each portfolio segment (defined by product or asset class and where relevant, industry sector and region) are based on a selected, small number of economic variables, (typically three to four) that best explain the temporal variations in portfolio loss rates. The process to select economic loss drivers involves empirical analysis and expert judgment.\n\nThe most material economic loss drivers are shown in the table below.\n\n| Portfolio                  | Economic loss drivers                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UK retail  mortgages       | UK unemployment rate, sterling swap  rate, UK house price index, UK  household debt to income |\n| UK retail  unsecured       | UK unemployment rate, sterling swap  rate, UK household debt to income                        |\n| UK corporates              | UK stock price index, UK GDP, Bank of  England base rate                                      |\n| UK commercial  real estate | UK stock price index, UK commercial  property price index, UK GDP, Bank of  England base rate |\n\n## Economic scenarios\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the range of anticipated future economic conditions was defined by a set of four internally developed scenarios and their respective probabilities. In addition to the base case, they comprised upside, downside and extreme downside scenarios. The scenarios primarily reflected the current risks faced by the economy, particularly related to high inflation resulting in a fall in real household income, economic slowdown, a rise in unemployment and asset price declines.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n195\n\nFor 2022, the four scenarios were deemed appropriate in capturing the uncertainty in economic forecasts and the nonlinearity in outcomes under different scenarios. These four scenarios were developed to provide sufficient coverage across potential rises in unemployment, inflation, asset price declines and the degree of permanent damage to the economy, around which there remains pronounced levels of uncertainty.\n\nUpside - This scenario assumes a robust growth through 2023 as consumers dip into excess savings built up since the COVID19 pandemic and further helped by fiscal support and strong business investment. The labour market remains resilient, with the unemployment rate remaining below pre-COVID-19 levels. Inflation retraces sharply and that does not necessitate significantly more tightening. The housing market slows down compared to the previous year but still remains robust.\n\nBase case - High inflation and significant monetary policy tightening leads to a mild recession in 2023. Fiscal support remains key in containing the impact. Unemployment rate rises modestly but job losses are contained. Inflation moderates over medium-term and falls to the target levels in 2024. Housing market experiences price decline and lower activity but the extent of the decline is lower than that experienced during prior stresses.\n\nSince 31 December 2021, the outlook has deteriorated as energy prices surged and cost of living crisis intensified. As a result, the base case is more pessimistic. The mild recession in 2023 contrasts with last year's assumption of a muted growth. House price correction contrasts with previous year's assumptions of a modest growth. In previous scenario, unemployment rate was expected to increase very modestly while inflation and interest rate rises last year were also relatively muted.\n\nDownside - Inflation rises on the back of further energy price spikes. The high inflation environment leads to the economy falling under recession. As demand dries up, inflation rapidly declines. Policy rates are raised initially but then quickly eased to assist in recovery. Unemployment is more than the base case scenario while house prices experience declines comparable to previous episodes of stress.\n\nExtreme downside - This scenario assumes high and persistent inflation. Households see the highest recorded decline in real income. Policy rate rises to levels last seen in early 2000. Resulting economic recession is deep and leads to widespread job losses. House prices lose approximately a third of their value while unemployment rate rises to level above those seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe previous year's extreme downside also included a deep recession, labour market deterioration and asset price falls, but the current scenario explores these risks in a high inflation, high rates environment.",

Similarly, a subjective approach was used at 30 September 2022, to reflect the deteriorating outlook and shifting balance of risks in the given set of scenarios. However, NatWest Group's quantitative approach to IFRS 9 multiple economic scenarios (MES) involves selecting a suitable set of discrete scenarios to characterise the distribution of risks in the economic outlook and assigning appropriate probability weights. This quantitative approach has been reinstated and is used for 31 December 2022.\n\nThe approach involves comparing UK GDP paths for NatWest Group's scenarios against a set of 1,000 model runs, following which, a percentile in the distribution is established that most closely corresponded to the scenario. Probability weight for base case is set first based on judgement, while probability weights for the alternate scenarios are assigned based on these percentiles scores.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n196\n\nThe assigned probability weights were judged to be aligned with the subjective assessment of balance of the risks in the economy. Since 31 December 2021, high inflation posed significant challenge to the economy and there is considerable uncertainty to the economic outlook, with respect to persistence and range of outcomes on inflation and its subsequent effects on household real income and economic activity. Given that backdrop, NatWest Group judges it appropriate to assign higher probability weights on downside-biased scenarios than at 31 December 2021. It presents good coverage to the range of outcomes assumed in the scenarios, including the potential for a robust recovery on the upside and exceptionally challenging outcomes on the downside. A 18.6% weighting was applied to the upside scenario, a 45.0% weighting applied to the base case scenario, a 20.8% weighting applied to the downside scenario and a 15.6% weighting applied to the extreme downside scenario. Compared to 30 June 2022, the probability weights were broadly similar, but with additional modest downside skew.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Economic loss drivers\n\n## UK gross domestic product (\u00a3bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bank of England base rate (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UK unemployment rate (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n197",

Economic loss drivers (audited)\n\n## Use of the scenarios in Personal lending\n\nPersonal lending follows a discrete scenario approach. The PD and LGD values for each discrete scenario are calculated using product specific economic response models. Each account has a PD and LGD calculated as probability weighted averages across the suite of economic scenarios.\n\n## Use of the scenarios in Wholesale lending\n\nThe Wholesale lending ECL methodology is based on the concept of CCIs. The CCIs represent, similar to the exogenous component in Personal, all relevant economic loss drivers for a region/industry segment aggregated into a single index value that describes the loss rate conditions in the respective segment relative to its long-run average. A CCI value of zero corresponds to loss rates at long-run average levels, a positive CCI value corresponds to loss rates below long run average levels and a negative CCI value corresponds to loss rates above long-run average levels.\n\nThe individual economic scenarios are translated into forwardlooking projections of CCIs using a set of econometric models. Subsequently the CCI projections for the individual scenarios are averaged into a single central CCI projection according to the given scenario probabilities. The central CCI projection is then overlaid with an additional mean reversion assumption to gradually revert to the long-run average CCI value of zero in the outer years of the projection horizon.\n\nFinally, ECL is calculated using a Monte Carlo approach by averaging PD and LGD values arising from many CCI paths simulated around the central CCI projection.\n\nThe rationale for the Wholesale approach is the long-standing observation that loss rates in Wholesale portfolios tend to follow regular cycles. This allows NatWest Group to enrich the range and depth of future economic conditions embedded in the final ECL beyond what would be obtained from using the discrete macro-economic scenarios alone.\n\nBusiness Banking, while part of the Wholesale segment for reporting purposes, utilises the Personal lending rather than the Wholesale lending methodology.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n199\n\n## U UKK  eeccoonnoommiicc  uunncceerrttaaiinnttyy\n\nThe high inflation environment and supply chain disruption are presenting significant headwinds for some businesses and sectors. These are a result of various factors and in many cases are compounding and look set to remain a feature of the economic environment into 2023. NatWest Group has considered where these are most likely to affect the customer base. Furthermore, the rising cost of borrowing during 2022 for both businesses and consumers presents an additional affordability challenge for many borrowers.\n\nThe effects of these risks are not expected to be fully captured by forward-looking credit modelling, particularly given the unique high inflation environment, low unemployment basecase outlook. Any incremental ECL effects for these risks will be captured via post model adjustments and are detailed further in the Governance and post model adjustments section.",

This is based on a normalised view removing the effects of the new definition of default, introduced from 1 January 2022, in accordance with new prudential regulation. As in 2021, model recalibrations to adjust for overprediction have been deferred where applicable, based on the judgment that default rate actuals may still be supressed as a result of government support provided throughout COVID-19.\n\nThe suite of UK Personal PD models and some Personal LGD models were redeveloped in 2022 removing the need for a number of previously applied post model ECL adjustments to account for model weaknesses.\n\nIn Wholesale lending, new economic response models were introduced in 2022 for the UK corporate segments, that follow an improved modelling approach and put higher weight on stock price indices compared to previous models.\n\nThe economic response models for Personal and Wholesale do not include direct inflation drivers, due to low inflation seen throughout the data history available for modelling (typically starting in early 2000s with some variation across products).\n\nThe effect of inflation is deemed to be partially reflected through other drivers present in the models, especially in Wholesale lending, where new models with a higher weight on stock price indices were introduced for the most material portfolios.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee  ssuuppppoorrtt  sscchheemmeess**\n\nThe table below shows the sector split for BBLS as well as associated debt split by stage.

The Bounce Back Loan Scheme is 100% guaranteed. For the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme the government guarantee is 80%. NatWest Group recognises lower LGDs for these lending products as a result, with 0% applied to the government-guaranteed part of the exposure. NatWest Group does not directly adjust the measurement of PD due to the government guarantee and continues to move exposures into Stage 2 and Stage 3 where a significant deterioration in credit risk or a default is identified.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Economic loss drivers (audited)\n\n|                            | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                            | BBL                     | BBL                     | BBL                     | BBL                     | Associated debt         | Associated debt         | Associated debt         | Associated debt         | ECL on associated debt  | ECL on associated debt  | ECL on associated debt  |\n|                            | Stage 1                 | Stage 2                 | Stage 3                 | Total                   | Stage 1                 | Stage 2                 | Stage 3                 | Total                   | Stage 1                 | Stage 2                 | Stage 3                 |\n| 31 December 2021           | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      |\n| Wholesale                  |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Property                   | 1,480                   | 218                     | 99                      | 1,797                   | 1,232                   | 165                     | 55                      | 1,452                   | 3                       | 13                      | 18                      |\n| Financial institutions     | 33                      | 5                       | 1                       | 39                      | 9                       | 20                      | 3                       | 32                      | -

This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forwardlooking economic conditions into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate.\n\nThe focus of the simulations is on ECL provisioning requirements on performing exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. The simulations are run on a stand-alone basis and are independent of each other; the potential ECL impacts reflect the simulated impact at 31 December 2022. Scenario impacts on SICR should be considered when evaluating the ECL movements of Stage 1 and Stage 2. In all scenarios the total exposure was the same but exposure by stage varied in each scenario.\n\nStage 3 provisions are not subject to the same level of measurement uncertainty - default is an observed event as at the balance sheet date. Stage 3 provisions therefore were not considered in this analysis.\n\nThe impact arising from the base case, upside, downside and extreme downside scenarios was simulated. These scenarios are used in the methodology for Personal multiple economic scenarios as described in the Economic loss drivers section. In the simulations, NatWest Group has assumed that the economic macro variables associated with these scenarios replace the existing base case economic assumptions, giving them a 100% probability weighting and therefore serving as a single economic scenario.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n201\n\nThese scenarios were applied to all modelled portfolios in the analysis below, with the simulation impacting both PDs and LGDs. Post model adjustments included in the ECL estimates that were modelled were sensitised in line with the modelled ECL movements, but those that were judgmental in nature, primarily those for deferred model calibrations and economic uncertainty, were not (refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section). As expected, the scenarios create differing impacts on ECL by portfolio and the impacts are deemed reasonable. In this simulation, it is assumed that existing modelled relationships between key economic variables and loss drivers hold, but in practice other factors would also have an impact, for example, potential customer behaviour changes and policy changes by lenders that might impact on the wider availability of credit.\n\nNatWest Group's core criterion to identify a SICR is founded on PD deterioration, as discussed above. Under the simulations, PDs change and result in exposures moving between Stage 1 and Stage 2 contributing to the ECL impact.",

Judgmental ECL post model adjustments, although reduced in value terms since 31 December 2021, continued to reflect economic uncertainty with the expectation of increased defaults in 2023 and beyond, and represented 12% of total ECL (2021 - 26%).\n- \uf02d If the economics were as negative as observed in the extreme downside, total Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL was simulated to increase by \u00a31.6 billion (approximately 93%). In this scenario, Stage 2 exposure increased significantly and was the key driver of the simulated ECL rise. The movement in Stage 2 balances in the other simulations was less significant.\n- \uf02d In the Wholesale portfolio, there was a significant increase in ECL under both a moderate and extreme downside scenario. The Wholesale property ECL increase was driven by commercial real estate prices which show negative growth until 2024 and significant deterioration in the stock index. The non-property increase was mainly due to GDP contraction and significant deterioration in the stock index.\n- \uf02d The changes in the economic outlook and scenarios used in the IFRS 9 MES framework at 31 December 2022 resulted in an increase in modelled ECL. Given that continued uncertainty remains due to the high inflation environment and supply chain disruption, NatWest Group utilised a framework of quantitative and qualitative measures to support the directional change and levels of ECL coverage, including economic data, credit performance insights and problem debt trends. This was particularly important for consideration of post model adjustments.\n- \uf02d As the effects of the high inflation environment and supply chain disruption evolve during 2022 and into 2023 and government support schemes have to be serviced, there is a risk of credit deterioration. However, the income statement effect of this will be mitigated by the forward-looking provisions retained on the balance sheet at 31 December 2022.\n- \uf02d There are a number of key factors that could drive further downside to impairments, through deteriorating economic and credit metrics and increased stage migration as credit risk increases for more customers. Such factors would include an adverse deterioration in GDP and unemployment in the economies in which NatWest Group operates.\n\n## M Moovveemmeenntt  iinn  EECCLL  pprroovviissiioonn**\n\nThe table below shows the main ECL provision movements during the year.\n\n|                                                                                        | ECL provision \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| At 1 January 2022                                                                      | 3,806              |\n| Transfers to disposal groups and reclassifications                                     | (338)              |\n| Changes in economic forecast                                                           | 341                |\n| Changes in risk metrics and exposure: Stage 1 and Stage 2                              | 14                 |\n| Changes in risk metrics and exposure: Stage 3                                          | 576                |\n| Judgmental changes: changes in post model adjustments for Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 | (428)              |\n| Write-offs and other                                                                   | (537)              |\n| At 31 December 2022                                                                    | 3,434              |\n| At 1 January 2021                                                                      | 6,186              |\n| 2021 movements                                                                         | (2,380)            |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                    | 3,806              |\n\n*Not within audit scope.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n204\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities Introduction\n\nThis section details the credit risk profile of NatWest Group's banking activities.

Comparatives have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain items as discontinued operations. Ulster Bank RoI continuing operations are now reported within Group central items & other. In 2022 we reclassified mortgage loans to fair value through profit or loss, which resulted in a \u20ac453 million reduction in mortgage financial assets in UBIDAC to 31 December 2022.

Unsecured lending balances also increased as consumer demand and spending recovered following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and with selective relaxation of lending criteria. Total ECL coverage reduced slightly during 2022, reflective of low unemployment and stable portfolio performance, while maintaining sufficient ECL coverage for key portfolios above 2019 levels, given increased inflationary and economic pressures. Increasing Stage 2 size and portfolio coverage in the second half of the year reflected the deterioration in economic outlook, with portfolio performance remaining broadly stable. Stage 3 ECL increased overall, mainly because of the IFRS 9 alignment to the new regulatory default definition, implemented on 1 January 2022. The implementation of new mortgage IFRS 9 models resulted in lower Stage 3 ECL coverage due to reduced loss estimates for cases where the customer was not subject to repossession activity and was the primary reason for the change in overall retail Stage 3 coverage during 2022.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n212\n\n- \uf02d Commercial & Institutional - There was growth in Commercial & Institutional, particularly as a result of increased exposure to financial institutions, notably leveraged funds, and larger corporate customers, primarily within information technology, telecommunications and power utilities. There were also continued repayments of COVID-19 government lending schemes, and strategic reductions in certain sectors. Sector appetite continues to be reviewed regularly, with particular focus on sector clusters and sub-sectors that are vulnerable to inflationary pressures or deemed to represent a heightened risk. Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL increased due to deterioration in forward-looking economics, although the Stage 2 growth was more than offset by reductions in post model adjustments. Coverage decreased with the reduction in COVID-19 post model adjustments, but coverage on Stage 1 and Stage 2 was significantly above 2019 levels, reflecting current inflationary and economic pressures.\n- \uf02d Other - Balance sheet reduction in 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to a reduction in central items held in the course of treasury related management activities, and a decrease due to the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank RoI.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk -

Exposure to the Republic of Ireland reduced during the year as part of the phased withdrawal noted previously. In Personal, balance sheet growth was a result of strong mortgage demand during the year. In Wholesale, there was a reduction in the balance sheet in Q4, following a period of growth up to Q3. This was mainly due to a reduction in central items held in the course of treasury related management activities. There was growth in Commercial & Institutional, particularly as a result of increased exposure to financial institutions, notably leveraged funds, and larger corporate customers, primarily within information technology, telecommunications and power utilities. Repayment performance under COVID-19 government lending schemes is closely tracked and exposure continued to decrease due to scheduled repayment activity and account closures. Exposures under the Bounce Bank Loan Scheme (BBLS) that benefit from the 100% government guarantee account for approximately 70% of remaining government scheme exposures. BBLS missed repayment rate and recoveries stock have increased but volumes continue to be in line with other lenders.\n- \uf02d Loans - Past due analysis - Overall, the past due profile of the key portfolios remained broadly stable. The implementation of the new regulatory default definition included refinements to the days past due calculations. This contributed to an increase in arrears in H1 2022 in Personal, however this moderated through the year. Particularly in mortgages, the exit from the Republic of Ireland also contributed to the reduction in past due exposures. In Wholesale, there was an increase in past due 1-30 days in corporates.\n- \uf02d Loans by stage - In both Wholesale and Personal, deterioration in forward-looking economics resulted in a larger proportion of accounts exhibiting a SICR compared to 2021. There was, therefore, a migration of exposures from Stage 1 into Stage 2 during 2022. Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high, are no longer collectively migrated into Stage 2. The relevance of this collective SICR identification was no longer considered as pertinent in the context of the current high inflation environment and related uncertainty.\n- \uf02d Weighted average 12 months PDs - In Personal, the Basel II point-in-time PDs improved slightly during 2022 due to stable credit performance in the portfolios. For IFRS 9 PDs, there were increases across mortgages and other personal lending as a result of new PD model implementations during the year, coupled with the deteriorating economic outlook in the second half of the year. For credit cards, the new IFRS 9 PD model implementation drove a net reduction in PD levels, primarily resulting from more accurate modelling of defaults driven by shifts in general unemployment. In Wholesale, the Basel II PDs were based on a through-thecycle approach and improved reflecting positive portfolio performance.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n218\n\n- The IFRS 9 PDs increased due the deterioration in forwardlooking economics. For further details refer to the Asset quality section.\n- \uf02d ECL provisions by stage - As mentioned above, Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL increased due to deterioration in forwardlooking economics, although the Stage 2 growth was more than offset by reductions in post model adjustments. Stage 3 provisions have yet to be materially affected by the high inflation environment and supply chain disruption, with increases relating to the introduction of the new regulatory definition of default, largely offset by write offs.\n- \uf02d ECL provision by geography - In line with loans by geography, the vast majority of ECL related to exposures in the UK, noting the reduction in RoI was mostly due to the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank RoI and moving of assets to discontinued operations and reclassifications.\n- \uf02d ECL provisions coverage - Overall provisions coverage reduced, due to the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank RoI, a change in product mix and a decrease in judgemental post model adjustments which more than offset increases from the deteriorating economic outlook.\n- \uf02d Loans by residual maturity - The maturity profile of the portfolios remained consistent with prior periods. In mortgages, as expected, the vast majority of exposures were greater than five years. In unsecured lending - cards and other - exposures were concentrated in less than five years. In Wholesale, in financial institutions and sovereigns, lending was concentrated in less than one year, In the rest of Wholesale, most of the lending was for residual maturity of one to five years.\n- \uf02d The ECL charge and loss rate - ECL charge and loss rate was low, with charges from a deterioration in forwardlooking economics countered by reductions in post model adjustments and the continued stable portfolio performance and low default trends.\n- \uf02d Other financial assets by asset quality - Consisting almost entirely of cash and balances at central banks and debt securities, held in the course of treasury related management activities, these assets were mainly within the AQ1-AQ4 bands.\n- \uf02d Off-balance sheet exposures by asset quality - In Personal, undrawn exposures were reflective of available credit lines in credit cards and current accounts. Additionally, the mortgage portfolio had undrawn exposures, where a formal offer had been made to a customer but had not yet drawn down; the value increased in line with the pipeline of offers. There was also a legacy portfolio of flexible mortgages where a customer had the right and ability to draw down further funds. The asset quality was aligned to the wider portfolio. In Wholesale, growth was primarily loan commitments to financial institutions and corporate sectors in the AQ1-AQ4 bands.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities continued Sector analysis - portfolio summary continued (audited)\n\n- \uf02d Wholesale forbearance - Forbearance flow and stock decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, noting that 2021 was adversely affected by COVID-19. Increased levels of forbearance were observed in Q4 2022. The retail & leisure, property and services sectors represented the largest share of forbearance flow. Labour shortages, the high inflation environment, rising fuel and energy costs, interest rate impacts and supply chain issues continue to weigh on these sectors. Payment holidays and covenant waivers were the most common forms of forbearance granted.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n219\n\n- \uf02d Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss Economic headwinds continue to present an uncertain outlook. Risk of Credit Loss framework exposures and inflows decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, noting again that 2021 was adversely affected by COVID-19. Inflows into the framework began to increase in Q4 2022. The sector breakdown of exposures within the framework remained consistent with prior periods. Retail SME customers do not form part of the Wholesale Risk of Credit Loss framework. Customers in this group, that are in financial difficulty, are instead managed by specialist problem debt management teams. The number of customers in arrears and recoveries increased significantly during 2022, driven by BBLS exposures. Excluding BBLS, the number of customers in this population in problem debt remains stable.",

It excludes loans that are commercial in nature.\n- (4) The new lending LTV in the comparative has been amended to reflect LTV at the time of lending origination rather than LTV at the reporting period.\n- (5) Forbearance flows only include an account once per year, although some accounts may be subject to multiple forbearance deals. Forbearance deals post default are excluded from these flows.\n- \uf02d The mortgage portfolio grew steadily during 2022, benefiting from buoyant housing market activity and customers remortgaging as interest rates rose across the market.\n- \uf02d LTV ratios improved as house prices increased as a result of housing market demand.\n- \uf02d The existing mortgage stock and new business were closely monitored against agreed risk appetite parameters. These included loan-to-value ratios, buy-to-let concentrations, new-build concentrations and credit quality. Affordability assessments and assumptions were continuously reviewed considering inflationary pressure, interest rate rises and taxation changes during the year.\n- \uf02d The buy-to-let portfolio grew in 2022. This growth was expected and within risk appetite following strategy and customer journey simplification implemented in H2 2021.\n- \uf02d Aligned to strong overall portfolio quality and low levels of early arrears, forbearance flows have decreased compared to the prior year.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n221\n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf02d\n\n- Unsecured lending increased during 2022, with resilient customer demand after the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.\n- As noted previously, ECL increased, for further detail of movements in ECL provisions at product level refer to the Flow statements section.",

Flood defences are considered where available. Flood scores are allocated per property based on the potential flood damage to property dependent on the type, frequency and depth of flooding modelled across different return periods. The scoring ranges from 0 to 53, with 0 being lowest and 53 being the highest risk. We consider a score of 11 and above to be high risk and properties with a score of 31 and above within the very high risk category after flood mitigants are taken into account. This is not within audit scope.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n223",

non-modelled portfolios and other exposures carried at fair value.\n- (2) ECL provisions coverage is ECL provisions divided by gross loans.\n- (3) Relates mainly to business banking, rate risk management products and unsecured corporate lending.\n- (4) Relates to the development of commercial and residential properties. LTV is not a meaningful measure for this type of lending activity.\n- \uf02d Overall - The majority of the CRE portfolio was located and managed in the UK. Business appetite and strategy was aligned across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d 2022 trends - The commercial property cycle turned around mid-year as rising interest rates started to put upward pressure on property yields. Commercial property values declined by an average of approximately 20% from their mid-year peak, ending the year approximately 14% lower. The industrial sector saw values fall fastest to date, yet it continues to attract strong occupier demand and may, therefore, be the first sector to see values stabilise. Secondary offices which don't match modern sustainability standards appear most at risk from further value loss. The residential sector has yet to show significant value declines, but transaction activity has slowed materially and is expected to remain weak until values have adjusted. The spike in mortgage costs last year would be expected to push prices down across the market in 2023. In contrast, residential rents appreciated rapidly in 2022 and professionally managed rental assets are expected to be relatively robust in 2023.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n225\n\n- \uf02d Credit quality - Credit quality was stable for the first nine months of the year but the impacts from the increase in base rate, projected capital value falls, inflationary pressures and concerns over recession for some customers began to materialise. Inflows into the Risk of Credit Loss framework picked up in Q4, but remained relatively low in volume terms, compared to previous downturns.\n- \uf02d Risk appetite - Lending appetite is subject to regular review with some level of tightening undertaken in 2022. Demand for facilities reduced significantly in Q4 as the market reacted to the various negative news points.",

They also show the changes in ECL as well as the changes in related financial assets used in determining ECL. Due to differences in scope, exposures may differ from those reported in other tables, principally in relation to exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. These differences do not have a material ECL effect. Other points to note:\n\n- \uf02d Financial assets include treasury liquidity portfolios, comprising balances at central banks and debt securities, as well as loans. Both modelled and non-modelled portfolios are included.\n- \uf02d Stage transfers (for example, exposures moving from Stage 1 into Stage 2) are a key feature of the ECL movements, with the net re-measurement cost of transitioning to a worse stage being a primary driver of income statement charges. Similarly, there is an ECL benefit for accounts improving stage.\n- \uf02d Changes in risk parameters shows the reassessment of the ECL within a given stage, including any ECL overlays and residual income statement gains or losses at the point of write-off or accounting write-down.\n- \uf02d Other (P&L only items) includes any subsequent changes in the value of written-down assets (for example, fortuitous recoveries) along with other direct write-off items such as direct recovery costs. Other (P&L only items) affects the income statement but does not affect balance sheet ECL movements.\n- \uf02d Amounts written-off represent the gross asset written-down against accounts with ECL, including the net asset writedown for any debt sale activity.\n- \uf02d There were flows from Stage 1 into Stage 3 including transfers due to unexpected default events.\n- \uf02d The effect of any change in post model adjustments during the year is typically reported under changes in risk parameters, as are any effects arising from changes to the underlying models. Refer to the section on Governance and post model adjustments for further details.\n- \uf02d All movements are captured monthly and aggregated. Interest suspended post default is included within Stage 3 ECL with the movement in the value of suspended interest during the year reported under currency translation and other adjustments.\n\n|                                             | Stage 1          | Stage 1   | Stage 2          | Stage 2   | Stage 3          | Stage 3   | Total            | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n|                                             | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL     |\n| NatWest Group total                         | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 January 2022                           | 546,178          | 302       | 35,557           | 1,478     | 5,238            | 2,026     | 586,973          | 3,806   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments  | 6,129            | -

ECL levels increased in the second half of the year as the portfolio continued to grow and the economic outlook deteriorated, increasing IFRS 9 PDs and the level of migrations from Stage 1 into Stage 2.\n- \uf02d The economic uncertainty post model adjustment allocated more ECL to Stage 1 given the forward-looking nature of the inflation threat on customer affordability, whereas the previous COVID-19 post model adjustment was focused on Stage 2 (for example, high risk payment holiday cases migrated into Stage 2). Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for more information.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n227\n\n- \uf02d The Stage 3 inflow was amplified by the adoption of the new regulatory definition of default in January 2022. However, Stage 3 ECL levels decreased since 31 December 2021, primarily due to reduced LGD estimates as a result of the new model implementation in Q1 2022 alongside stable underlying default levels. The relatively small ECL cost for net re-measurement on stage transfer included the effect of risk targeted ECL adjustments, when previously in Stage 2. Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.\n- \uf02d Write-off typically occurs once the repossessed property has been sold and there is a residual shortfall balance remaining outstanding. This would typically be within five years from default but can be longer.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nGovernance",

There was an increase in cases triggering PD deterioration reflecting the deteriorating economic outlook.\n- \uf02d Moving exposures on to the Risk of Credit Loss framework remained an important backstop indicator of a SICR. The exposures classified under the Stage 2 Risk of Credit Loss framework decreased over the period due to the increase in PD deterioration.\n- \uf02d PD persistence related to the Business Banking portfolio only. A reduction in PDs in 2021 meant that some Business Banking customers returned to Stage 1 in early 2022, although a number of these customers returned through PD movement in the second half of the year due to the deteriorating economic outlook.\n\n## Stage 3 vintage analysis\n\nThe table below shows estimated vintage analysis of the material Stage 3 portfolios.\n\n|                            | 2022                     | 2022      | 2021                     | 2021      |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|\n|                            | Retail Banking mortgages | Wholesale | Retail Banking mortgages | Wholesale |\n| Stage 3 loans (\u00a3bn)        | 1.7                      | 2.5       | 1.2                      | 2.1       |\n| Vintage (time in default): |                          |           |                          |           |\n| <1 year                    | 43%                      | 29%       | 26%                      | 19%       |\n| 1-3 years                  | 26%                      | 12%       | 30%                      | 20%       |\n| 3-5 years                  | 12%                      | 7%        | 13%                      | 7%        |\n| 5-10 years                 | 9%                       | 52%       | 17%                      | 54%       |\n| >10 years                  | 10%                      | -

As expected, mortgage exposures have a higher proportion in AQ1-AQ4 than unsecured borrowing.\n- \uf02d The increase in AQ10/Stage 3 balances was mainly because of the IFRS 9 alignment to the new regulatory default definition, implemented on 1 January 2022. This change resulted in an increase in Stage 3 exposures of approximately \u00a30.7 billion, mostly in mortgages.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n238\n\n- \uf02d In other Personal, the relatively high level of exposures in AQ10 reflected that impaired assets can be held on the balance sheet, with commensurate ECL provision for up to six years after default.\n- \uf02d ECL provisions coverage shows the expected trend with increased coverage in the weaker asset quality bands, and also by stage.\n- \uf02d Across the majority of asset quality bands, migration from Stage 1 into Stage 2 was observed as the effect of updated economic scenarios increased IFRS 9 PDs and therefore Stage 2 exposure.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk -

The majority of the portfolio was within the AQ1AQ4, and AQ5-AQ8 bands.

The framework ensures the tools and capability are in place to facilitate the management and mitigation of risk ensuring NatWest Group operates within its regulatory requirements and risk appetite.\n\n## Definitions (audited)\n\nRegulatory capital consists of reserves and instruments issued that are available, have a degree of permanency and are capable of absorbing losses. A number of strict conditions set by regulators must be satisfied to be eligible as capital.\n\nCapital risk is the risk that there is or will be insufficient capital and other loss-absorbing debt instruments to operate effectively including meeting minimum regulatory requirements, operating within Board approved risk appetite and supporting its strategic goals.\n\nLiquidity consists of assets that can be readily converted to cash within a short timeframe at a reliable value. Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when they fall due.\n\nFunding consists of on-balance sheet liabilities that are used to provide cash to finance assets. Funding risk is the risk of not maintaining a diversified, stable and cost-effective funding base.\n\nLiquidity and funding risks arise in a number of ways, including through the maturity transformation role that banks perform. The risks are dependent on factors such as:\n\n- \uf02d Maturity profile;\n- \uf02d Composition of sources and uses of funding;\n- \uf02d The quality and size of the liquidity portfolio;\n- \uf02d Wholesale market conditions; and\n- \uf02d Depositor and investor behaviour.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited) C Caappiittaall\n\nThe eligibility of instruments and financial resources as regulatory capital is laid down by applicable regulation. Capital is categorised under two tiers (Tier 1 and Tier 2) according to the ability to absorb losses, degree of permanency and the ranking of absorbing losses on either a going or gone concern basis. There are three broad categories of capital across these two tiers:\n\n- \uf02d CET1 capital - CET1 capital must be perpetual and capable of unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur. This includes ordinary shares issued and retained earnings.\n- \uf02d Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital - This is the second type of loss absorbing capital and must be capable of absorbing losses on a going concern basis. These instruments are either written down or converted into CET1 capital when the CET1 ratio falls below a pre-specified level.\n- \uf02d Tier 2 capital - Tier 2 capital is supplementary capital and provides loss absorption on a gone concern basis. Tier 2 capital absorbs losses after Tier 1 capital. It typically consists of subordinated debt securities with a minimum maturity of five years at the point of issuance.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n244\n\n## M Miinniimmuumm  rreeqquuiirreemmeenntt  ffoorr  oowwnn  ffuunnddss  aanndd  eelliiggiibbllee  lliiaabbiilliittiieess ( (MMRREELL))\n\nIn addition to capital, other specific loss-absorbing instruments, including senior notes issued by NatWest Group, may be used to cover certain gone concern capital requirements, which is referred to as MREL. Gone concern refers to the situation in which resources must be available to enable an orderly resolution, in the event that the Bank of England (BoE) deems that NatWest Group has failed or is likely to fail.\n\n## L Liiqquuiiddiittyy\n\nNatWest Group maintains a prudent approach to the definition of liquidity resources. NatWest Group manages its liquidity to ensure it is always available when and where required, taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints. Following ring-fencing legislation, liquidity is no longer considered fungible across NatWest Group. Principal liquidity portfolios are maintained in the UK Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (UK DoLSub) (primarily in NatWest Bank Plc), UBIDAC, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International Limited and NWM N.V.. Some disclosures in this section where relevant are presented, on a consolidated basis, for NatWest Group, the UK DoLSub and on a solo basis for NatWest Markets Plc.\n\nLiquidity resources are divided into primary and secondary liquidity as follows:\n\n- \uf02d Primary liquid assets include cash and balances at central banks, Treasury bills and other high quality government and supranational securities.\n- \uf02d Secondary liquid assets are eligible as collateral for local central bank liquidity facilities. These assets include ownissued securitisations or whole loans that are retained on balance sheet and pre-positioned with a central bank so that they may be converted into additional sources of liquidity at very short notice.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg\n\nNatWest Group maintains a diversified set of funding sources, including customer deposits, wholesale deposits and term debt issuance. NatWest Group also retains access to central bank funding facilities.\n\nFor further details on capital constituents and the regulatory framework covering capital, liquidity and funding requirements, please refer to the 2022 NatWest Group Pillar 3 Report.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements Financial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk continued Capital management\n\nCapital management ensures that there is sufficient capital and other loss-absorbing instruments to operate effectively including meeting minimum regulatory requirements, operating within Board-approved risk appetite, maintaining its credit rating and supporting its strategic goals.\n\nCapital management is critical in supporting the businesses and is enacted through an end-to-end framework across businesses and legal entities. Capital is managed within the organisation at the following levels; NatWest Group consolidated, NWH Group sub consolidated, NatWest Markets Plc, NatWest Markets N.V. and RBS International Limited. The banking subsidiaries within NWH Group are governed by the same principles, processes and management as NatWest Group. Note that although the aforementioned entities are regulated in line with Basel III principles, local implementation of the framework differs across geographies.\n\nCapital planning is integrated into NatWest Group's wider annual budgeting process and is assessed and updated at least monthly. Regular returns are submitted to the PRA which include a two-year rolling forecast view. Other elements of capital management, including risk appetite and stress testing, are set out on pages 181 and 182.\n\n## Produce capital plans\n\nAssess capital adequacy\n\nInform capital actions\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n245\n\nCapital plans are produced for NatWest Group, its key operating entities and its businesses over a five year planning horizon under expected and stress conditions. Stressed capital plans are produced to support internal stress testing in the ICAAP for regulatory purposes.\n\nShorter term forecasts are developed frequently in response to actual performance, changes in internal and external business environment and to manage risks and opportunities.\n\nCapital plans are developed to maintain capital of sufficient quantity and quality to support NatWest Group's business, its subsidiaries and strategic plans over the planning horizon within approved risk appetite, as determined via stress testing, and minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nCapital resources and capital requirements are assessed across a defined planning horizon.\n\nImpact assessment captures input from across NatWest Group including from businesses.\n\nCapital planning informs potential capital actions including buy backs, redemptions, dividends and new issuance to external investors or via internal transactions.\n\nDecisions on capital actions will be influenced by strategic and regulatory requirements, risk appetite, costs and prevailing market conditions.\n\nAs part of capital planning, NatWest Group will monitor its portfolio of external capital securities and assess the optimal blend and most cost effective means of financing.\n\nCapital planning is one of the tools that NatWest Group uses to monitor and manage capital risk on a going and gone concern basis, including the risk of excessive leverage.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages its liquidity risk taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints to ensure sufficient liquidity is available where required to cover liquidity stresses. The principal levels at which liquidity risk is managed are:\n\n- \uf02d NatWest Group\n- \uf02d NatWest Holdings Group\n- \uf02d UK DoLSub\n- \uf02d UBIDAC\n- \uf02d NatWest Markets Plc\n- \uf02d NatWest Markets Securities Inc.\n- \uf02d RBS International Limited\n- \uf02d NWM N.V.\n- \uf02d NatWest Bank Europe GmbH\n\nThe UK DoLSub is PRA regulated and comprises NatWest Group's three licensed deposit-taking UK banks: National Westminster Bank Plc (NWB Plc), The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc) and Coutts & Company. Ulster Bank Limited was removed from the UK DoLSub effective 1 January 2022 and its banking license was officially revoked following regulatory approval on 29 December 2022.\n\nNatWest Group categorises its liquidity portfolio, including its locally managed liquidity portfolios, into primary and secondary liquid assets. The size of the liquidity portfolios are determined by referencing NatWest Group's liquidity risk appetite. NatWest Group retains a prudent approach to setting the composition of the liquidity portfolios, which is subject to internal policies applicable to all entities and limits over quality of counterparty, maturity mix and currency mix.\n\nRBS International Limited, NWM N.V. and UBIDAC hold locally managed portfolios that comply with local regulations that may differ from PRA rules.\n\nThe liquidity value of the portfolio is determined by taking current market prices and applying a discount or haircut, to give a liquidity value that represents the amount of cash that can be generated by the asset.\n\n## Funding risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages funding risk through a comprehensive framework which measures and monitors the funding risk on the balance sheet including quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities as well as the funding concentration.",

Regulatory changes are actively monitored by NatWest Group, including engagement with industry associations and regulators and participation in quantitative impact studies. Monitoring the changing regulatory landscape forms a fundamental part of capital planning and management of its business. NatWest Group believes that its strategy to focus on simpler, lower risk activities within a more resilient recovery and resolution framework will enable it to manage the impact of these.\n\n## U UKK  aanndd  EEUU  iimmpplleemmeennttaattiioonn  ooff  BBaasseell  ffrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nThe European Union (EU) implemented the initial phase of the Basel III capital framework through the CRR and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). On 7 June 2019, amendments to the CRR and CRD (known as CRR2 and CRD5 respectively) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The majority of these changes were implemented in June 2021. Further changes relating to the Basel 3.1 standard will be implemented in EU by CRR3 and CRD6 for which the European Commission issued a proposal in October 2021. The implementation of these changes is not expected until January 2025 however the impact of those will be limited to NatWest Group's EU subsidiaries.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, NatWest Group has been regulated under the onshored CRR and associated onshored binding technical standards which were created by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and amending statutory instruments.  As the Withdrawal Act applied to the CRR in place as of 31 December 2020, changes to the CRR in the EU are not reflected in the UK CRR unless separately legislated and amended by statutory instruments. Going forward, the Financial Services Bill gives the PRA the power to write prudential rules directly into the PRA rulebook and they will co-ordinate with HM Treasury to implement any required changes to the UK CRR.\n\nAs detailed above, the changes to the EU CRR included the substantial CRR2 amendments and equivalent reforms were eventually implemented in UK on 1 January 2022.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n246\n\nOn 30 November 2022, the PRA published its consultation paper CP16/22 setting out its proposed rules and expectations with respect to the Basel 3.1 standards that remain to be implemented in the UK. This will complete the implementation of post-global financial crisis prudential reforms, which were designed to i) increase the quantity of capital in the system, per unit of risk; ii) increase the quality of capital held by firms; and iii) improve the accuracy of risk-management firms, reducing the variability of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The changes mainly impact capital requirements for STD (Standardised) and IRB (Internal Ratings Based) Credit Risk, Market Risk, CVA, Counterparty Credit Risk and Operational Risk. An aggregate 'output floor' is also being introduced to ensure that total RWAs for firms using advanced or internally modelled methods and subject to the floor cannot fall below 72.5% of RWAs under the standardised approach. The proposal did not include further changes to the Leverage Ratio, Large Exposures and Liquidity Risk frameworks.\n\nImplementation of the PRA proposals is scheduled to align with that of the European Union, with a projected compliance date of 1 January 2025. The PRA's consultation period will end on 31 March 2023. See summary table for further details on PRA's proposal.\n\n## O Otthheerr  ddeevveellooppmmeennttss\n\nOn 29 November 2022, the PRA published PS9/22 which contained amendments to PRA's approach to identifying other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). The amendments mainly aimed at removing EBA's scoring methodology from the O-SII identification process and changing specific indicators and weights in PRA's scoring methodology. In its policy statement, the PRA clarified that O-SII designation does not automatically result in higher loss absorbency requirements in the form of an O-SII buffer or otherwise. An O-SII buffer can only apply to OSIIs, or part of an O-SII that are ring-fenced bodies (RFBs).\n\nOn the same date, the PRA also published its 2022 list of firms designated as O-SIIs. NatWest Group is part of PRA's O-SII list. Simultaneously, the PRA published a statement confirming a freeze of firms' O-SII buffer rates in 2022. O-SII buffers will be maintained at 2019 levels and the PRA will assess rates in 2023 based on its revised methodology. The decision on O-SII buffer rates taken in December 2023 will be based on end-2022 financial results and will take effect from January 2025 in line with PRA's policy. This PRA statement is therefore relevant to NatWest Holdings Limited which is currently subject an O-SII buffer.\n\nStrategic report Strategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk continued\n\n## Summary of future changes to prudential regulation in UK that may impact NatWest Group\n\nThe table below covers expected future changes to prudential regulation in the UK which may impact NatWest Group at a consolidated level. Certain entities within the group will be exposed to changes in prudential regulation from other legislative bodies and/or local supervisory authorities where NatWest Group's entities are authorised (e.g. EU and Jersey) on a solo basis and these changes may be different in substance, scope and timing than those highlighted below.\n\n| Area of development                          | Key changes   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Source of changes/implementation date                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leverage ratio  framework                    | \uf02d             | Binding leverage ratio at individual bank level for  material entities i.e. LREQ firms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \uf02d SS45/15 - UK Leverage ratio framework \uf02d Implementation: 1 January 2023                                                            |\n| Capital - Output floor                       | \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d         | Level of application: Applies at highest level of  application: Consolidated level for UK Groups; sub- consolidated level for Ring Fenced sub-groups.

The typical characteristics that support encumbrance are an ability to pledge those assets to another counterparty or entity through operation of law without necessarily requiring prior notification, homogeneity, predictable and measurable cash flows, and a consistent and uniform underwriting and collection process. Retail assets including residential mortgages, credit card receivables and personal loans display many of these features.\n\nNatWest Group categorises its assets into four broad groups, those that are:\n\n- \uf02d Already encumbered and used to support funding currently in place through own-asset securitisations, covered bonds and securities repurchase agreements.\n- \uf02d Pre-positioned with central banks as part of funding schemes and those encumbered under such schemes.\n- \uf02d Ring-fenced to meet regulatory requirements, where NatWest Group has in place an operational continuity in resolution (OCIR) investment mandate wherein the PRA requires critical service providers to hold segregated liquidity buffers covering at least 50% of their annual fixed overheads.\n- \uf02d Not currently encumbered. In this category, NatWest Group has in place an enablement programme which seeks to identify assets capable of being encumbered and to identify the actions to facilitate such encumbrance whilst not affecting customer relationships or servicing.\n\nProgrammes to manage the use of assets to actively support funding are established within UK DoLSub, UBIDAC and NatWest Markets Plc.\n\n## Balance sheet encumbrance\n\nThe table shows the retained encumbrance assets of NatWest Group.\n\n|                                     | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Pre-positioned                      | Collateral ring-fenced         | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   |              |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                                     | Covered debts & securitisa-                                                           | SFT, derivatives and similar                                                          | Total                                                                                 | & encumbered assets held at central | to meet regulatory requirement | Readily available                                           | Other available                                             | Cannot be used                                              |                                                             |              |\n|                                     | tions (1)                                                                             | (2,3)                                                                                 | (4)                                                                                   | banks (5)                           | (6)                            | (7)                                                         | (8)                                                         | (9)                                                         | Total                                                       | (10)         |\n| 2022                                |                                                                                       |                                                                                       | \u00a3bn                                                                                   | \u00a3bn                                 | \u00a3bn                            | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn          |\n| Cash and balances at central        | \u00a3bn                                                                                   | \u00a3bn                                                                                   |                                                                                       |                                     |                                |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |              |\n| Trading assets                      | -

Non-traded and traded market risk exposures are managed and discussed separately. The non-traded market risk section begins below. The traded market risk section begins on page 272. Pension-related activities also give rise to market risk. Refer to page 276 for more information on risk related to pensions.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\n## Definition (audited)\n\nNon-traded market risk is the risk to the value of assets or liabilities outside the trading book, or the risk to income, that arises from changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, or from changes in managed rates.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited)\n\nThe key sources of non-traded market risk are interest rate risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and accounting volatility risk.\n\nFor detailed qualitative and quantitative information on each of these risk types, refer to the separate sub-sections following the VaR table below.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d Interest rates in the UK increased sharply in 2022, to levels higher than expected at the end of 2021. The Bank of England base rate rose from 0.25% at 31 December 2021 to 3.5% at 31 December 2022. The five-year sterling overnight index interest rate swap rate rose from 1.05% at 31 December 2021 to 4.10% at 31 December 2022. The corresponding ten-year rate rose from 0.95% to 3.75%.\n- \uf02d Overall, non-traded VaR decreased over the year, driven by a decrease in credit spread VaR. This reflected reduced holdings of bonds in the liquidity portfolio. Interest rate VaR rose, reflecting higher interest rate volatility, particularly in sterling. By year-end, interest rate risk had displaced credit spread risk as the main driver of non-traded VaR.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group's structural hedge notional increased to \u00a3230 billion at 31 December 2022 from \u00a3206 billion at 31 December 2021 as more balances were included in the hedging programme.\n- \uf02d Higher swap rates were reflected in a higher yield on the structural hedge, which rose from 0.75% in 2021 to 0.96% in 2022.\n- \uf02d The sensitivity of net interest earnings to a 25-basis-point upward shift in the yield curve fell to a cumulative \u00a3886 million over three years at 31 December 2022, from \u00a31,107 million at 31 December 2021. The main contributors to lower sensitivity were lower deposit volumes and increased structural hedging.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n264\n\n- \uf02d Sterling weakened against the US dollar, to 1.21 at 31 December 2022 compared to 1.35 at 31 December 2021. It also weakened against the euro, to 1.13 at 31 December 2022 compared to 1.19 at 31 December 2021. Residual structural foreign currency exposures decreased over the year by \u00a31.5 billion, in sterling equivalent terms, mainly due to increased hedging.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nResponsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from non-trading activities lies with the relevant business. Oversight is provided by the independent Risk function.\n\nRisk positions are reported regularly to the Executive Risk Committee, the Board Risk Committee, and the Board as well as to the Asset & Liability Management Committee. Non-traded market risk policy sets out the governance and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite is set out in the nontraded market risk appetite statement.\n\nIts quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of value-at-risk (VaR), stressed value-at-risk (SVaR), sensitivity and stress limits, and earnings-at-risk limits.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments. To ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers have been set and are actively managed.

        "page_content": "## Non-traded market risk continued Interest rate risk\n\nNon-traded interest rate risk (NTIRR) arises from the provision to customers of a range of banking products with differing interest rate characteristics. When aggregated, these products form portfolios of assets and liabilities with varying degrees of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Mismatches can give rise to volatility in net interest income as interest rates vary.\n\nNTIRR comprises the following three primary risk types:\n\n- \uf02d Gap risk: arises from the timing of rate changes in nontrading book instruments. The extent of gap risk depends on whether changes to the term structure of interest rates occur consistently across the yield curve (parallel risk) or differentially by period (non-parallel risk).\n- \uf02d Basis risk: captures the impact of relative changes in interest rates for financial instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices, or on the same interest rate indices but with different tenors.\n- \uf02d Option risk: arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in assets, liabilities and/or offbalance sheet items, where NatWest Group or its customer can alter the level and timing of their cash flows. Option risk also includes pipeline risk.\n\nTo manage exposures within its risk appetite, NatWest Group aggregates interest rate positions and hedges its residual exposure, primarily with interest rate swaps.\n\nStructural hedging aims to reduce gap risk and the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate shocks. It also provides some protection against prolonged periods of falling rates. Structural hedging is explained in greater detail below, followed by information on how NatWest Group measures NTIRR from both an economic value-based and an earnings-based perspective.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  hheeddggiinngg\n\nNatWest Group has a significant pool of stable, non and low interest-bearing liabilities, principally comprising current accounts and savings, in addition to its equity and reserves. A proportion of these balances are hedged, either by investing directly in longerterm fixed-rate assets (such as fixed-rate mortgages) or by using interest rate swaps, which are generally booked as cash flow hedges of floating-rate assets, in order to provide a consistent and predictable revenue stream.\n\nAfter hedging the net interest rate exposure externally, NatWest Group allocates income to equity or products in structural hedges by reference to the relevant interest rate swap curve. Over time, this approach has provided a basis for stable income attribution for management purposes to products and interest rate returns. The programme aims to track a time series of medium-term swap rates, but the yield will be affected by changes in product volumes and NatWest Group's equity capital.\n\nThe table below shows the total income and total yield, incremental income, and the period-end and average notional balances allocated to equity and products in respect of the structural hedges managed by NatWest Group. Total income represents the fixed leg of the hedge, while incremental income represents the difference between total income and short-term cash rates.\n\n|         | 2022                  | 2022            | 2022                    | 2022                 | 2022          | 2021                  | 2021            | 2021                    | 2021                 | 2021          |\n|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n|         | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | Average notional \u00a3bn | Total yield % | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | Average notional \u00a3bn | Total yield % |\n| Equity  | 71                    | 363             | 21                      | 21                   | 1.77          | 426                   | 448             | 21                      | 22                   | 2.05          |\n| Product | (973)                 | 1,571           | 184                     | 176                  | 0.89          | 744                   | 861             | 161                     | 145                  | 0.59          |\n| Other   | (112)                 | 201             | 25                      | 26                   | 0.77          | 139                   | 115             | 24                      | 23                   | 0.51          |\n| Total   | (1,014)               | 2,135           | 230                     | 223                  | 0.96          | 1,309                 | 1,424           | 206                     | 190                  | 0.75          |\n\nEquity structural hedges refer to income allocated primarily to equity and reserves.

The total yield of the structural hedge also rose to 0.96% in 2022 from 0.75% in 2021, although the yield on the equity hedge fell as higher yielding hedges matured.\n- \uf02d The five-year sterling swap rate rose to 4.10% at the end of December 2022 from 1.05% at the end of December 2021. The ten-year sterling swap rate also rose, from 0.95% to 3.75%.\n\nNTIRR can be measured using value-based or earnings-based approaches. Value-based approaches measure the change in value of the balance sheet assets and liabilities including all cash flows. Earnings-based approaches measure the potential impact on the income statement of changes in interest rates over a defined horizon, generally one to three years.\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR as its value-based approach and sensitivity of net interest earnings as its earnings-based approach.\n\nThese two approaches provide complementary views of the impact of interest rate risk on the balance sheet at a point in time. The scenarios employed in the net interest earnings sensitivity approach may incorporate assumptions about how NatWest Group and its customers will respond to a change in the level of interest rates. In contrast, the VaR approach measures the sensitivity of the balance sheet at a point in time. Capturing all cash flows, VaR also highlights the impact of duration and repricing risks beyond the one-to-three-year period shown in earnings sensitivity calculations.\n\n## V Vaalluuee--aatt--rriisskk\n\nVaR is a statistical estimate of the potential change in the market value of a portfolio (and, thus, the impact on the income statement) over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.\n\nNatWest Group's standard VaR metrics - which assume a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99% - are based on interest rate repricing gaps at the reporting date. Daily rate moves are modelled using observations from the last 500 business days. These incorporate customer products plus associated funding and hedging transactions as well as non-financial assets and liabilities. Behavioural assumptions are applied as appropriate.\n\nThe non-traded interest rate risk VaR metrics for NatWest Group's retail and commercial banking activities are included in the banking book VaR table presented earlier in this section. The VaR captures the risk resulting from mismatches in the repricing dates of assets and liabilities.\n\nIt also includes any mismatch between the maturity profile of external hedges and NatWest Group's target maturity profile for the hedge.\n\n- \uf02d Incremental income, which measures the difference between total yield and short term interest rates, turned negative. This reflects the relative stability of the total yield of the structural hedge. Compared to the 21-basis-point increase in the structural hedge total yield, the sterling overnight index average (SONIA) increased 324 basis points to 3.43% at 31 December 2022 from 0.19% at 31 December 2021.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n267",

A simple scenario is shown that projects forward earnings based on the 31 December 2022 balance sheet, which is assumed to remain constant. An earnings projection is derived from the market-implied curve, which is then subject to interest rate shocks. The difference between the market-implied projection and the shock gives an indication of underlying sensitivity to interest rate movements.\n\nReported sensitivities should not be considered a forecast of future performance in these rate scenarios. Actions that could reduce interest earnings sensitivity include changes in pricing strategies on customer loans and deposits as well as hedging.

Valuation changes that are not hedged (or not in effective hedge accounting relationships) are recognised in FVOCI reserves.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used to implement the structural hedging programme and also hedging of some personal and commercial lending portfolios, primarily fixed-rate mortgages. Generally, these swaps are booked in hedge accounting relationships. Changes in the valuation of swaps that are in effective cash flow hedge accounting relationships are recognised in cash flow hedge reserves.\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of FVOCI reserves and cash flow hedge reserves to a parallel shift in all rates. Cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective and interest rate hedges of bonds in the liquidity portfolio are also assumed to be subject to fully effective hedge accounting. No change in the spread between bonds and swaps is assumed. Hedge accounting ineffectiveness would result in deviation from the results below, with gains or losses recognised in P&L instead of reserves. Hedge ineffectiveness P&L is monitored, and the effectiveness of cash flow and fair value hedge relationships is regularly tested in accordance with IFRS requirements. Note that a movement in the FVOCI reserve would have an impact on CET1 capital but a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not be expected to do so. Volatility in both reserves affects tangible net asset value.\n\n|                          | 2022   | 2022   | 2022                                                                 | 2022   | 2021             | 2021   | 2021                                                | 2021   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|                          |        |        | +25 basis points -25 basis points +100 basis points-100 basis points |        | +25 basis points |        | -25 basis points+100 basis points -100 basis points |        |\n|                          | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                                                                   | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                                                  | \u00a3m     |\n| FVOCI reserves           | (3)    | 2      | (13)                                                                 | 5      | (46)             | 45     | (187)                                               | 174    |\n| Cash flow hedge reserves | (278)  | 281    | (1,097)                                                              | 1,138  | (210)            | 214    | (820)                                               | 877    |\n| Total                    | (281)  | 283    | (1,110)                                                              | 1,143  | (256)            | 259    | (1,007)                                             | 1,051  |\n\n- \uf02d The sensitivity of FVOCI and cash flow hedge reserves increased in 2022, mainly due to increased cash flow hedging, partly offset by a reduction in FVOCI sensitivity as a result of bond disposals.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n269",

Additionally, other highquality bond portfolios are held for collateral purposes and to support payment systems.\n\nCredit spread risk is monitored daily through sensitivities and VaR measures (refer to the non-traded VaR table earlier in this section). Exposures and limit utilisations are reported to senior management on a regular basis. Dealing mandates in place for the bond portfolios further mitigate the risk by imposing constraints by duration, asset class and credit rating.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nNon-traded foreign exchange risk arises from three main sources:\n\n- \uf02d Structural foreign exchange rate risk - mainly arises from the capital deployed in foreign subsidiaries and branches.\n- \uf02d Transactional foreign exchange rate risk - arises from customer transactions and profits and losses that are in a currency other than the functional currency.\n- \uf02d Forecast earnings or costs in foreign currencies - NatWest Group assesses its potential exposure to forecast foreign currency income and expenses. NatWest Group hedges forward some forecast expenses.\n\n## F Foorreeiiggnn  eexxcchhaannggee  rriisskk (audited)\n\nThe table below shows structural foreign currency exposures.\n\n| 2022               | Net investments in foreign operations \u00a3m   | Net investment hedges \u00a3m   | Structural foreign currency exposures pre-economic hedges \u00a3m   | Economic hedges (1) \u00a3m   | Residual Structural foreign currency exposures \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| US dollar          | 1,278                                      | (303)                      | 975                                                            | (975)                    | -                                                   |\n| Euro               | 6,189                                      | (4,164)                    | 2,025                                                          | -                        | 2,025                                               |\n| Other non-sterling | 996                                        | (431)                      | 565                                                            | -                        | 565                                                 |\n| Total              | 8,463                                      | (4,898)                    | 3,565                                                          | (975)                    | 2,590                                               |\n| 2021               |                                            |                            |                                                                |                          |                                                     |\n| US dollar          | 1,275                                      | (260)                      | 1,015                                                          | (1,015)                  | -                                                   |\n| Euro               | 6,222                                      | (2,669)                    | 3,553                                                          | -                        | 3,553                                               |\n| Other non-sterling | 990                                        | (421)                      | 569                                                            | -                        | 569                                                 |\n| Total              | 8,487                                      | (3,350)                    | 5,137                                                          | (1,015)                  | 4,122                                               |\n\n- \uf02d Residual structural foreign currency exposures fell in 2022, mainly due to increased hedging of net investments in euro operations.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n270\n\n- \uf02d Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect equity in proportion to structural foreign currency exposure pre economic hedges. For example, a 5% strengthening or weakening in foreign currencies against sterling would result in a gain or loss of \u00a30.2 billion in equity respectively.\n\nThe most material non-traded open currency positions are the structural foreign exchange exposures arising from investments in foreign subsidiaries and branches. These exposures are assessed and managed to predefined risk appetite levels under delegated authority agreed by the CFO with support from the Asset & Liability Management Committee. NatWest Group seeks to limit the potential volatility impact on its CET1 ratio from exchange rate movements by deliberately maintaining a structural open currency position. Gains or losses arising from the retranslation of net investments in overseas operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and reduce the sensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movements primarily arising from the retranslation of non-sterling denominated RWAs. Sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to RWAs equals the CET1 ratio.\n\nThe sensitivity of this ratio to exchange rates is monitored monthly and reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee at least quarterly. Foreign exchange exposures arising from customer transactions are hedged by businesses on a regular basis in line with NatWest Group policy.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management Risk and capital management Risk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Non-traded market risk continued Equity risk (audited)\n\nNon-traded equity risk is the potential variation in income and reserves arising from changes in equity valuations. Equity exposures may arise through strategic acquisitions, through participations in industry schemes (for example, SWIFT) or through private equity arrangements (for example, the Big Society scheme).\n\nInvestments, acquisitions or disposals of a strategic nature are referred to the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee. Once approved by the CFO with support from the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee for execution, such transactions are referred for approval to the Board, the Executive Committee, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer or as otherwise required. Decisions to acquire or hold equity positions in the non-trading book that are not of a strategic nature are taken by authorised persons with delegated authority.\n\nEquity positions are carried at fair value on the balance sheet based on market prices where available. If market prices are not available, fair value is based on appropriate valuation techniques or management estimates.\n\nThe table below shows the balance sheet carrying value of equity positions in the banking book.\n\n|                          |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Exchange-traded equity   |       154 |        16 |\n| Private equity and other |       170 |       226 |\n|                          |       324 |       242 |\n\nThe exposures may take the form of (i) equity shares listed on a recognised exchange, (ii) private equity shares defined as unlisted equity shares with no observable market parameters or (iii) other unlisted equity shares such as participation in SWIFT.\n\n|                                                           |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net realised gains arising from disposals                 |       106 |         8 |\n| Unrealised gains included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital (1) |        89 |        88 |\n\n- \uf02d The increase in equity investments mainly reflects the acquisition of new investments in PTSB and Vodeno in H2 2022, partly offset by disposals.\n\n## Accounting volatility risk\n\nAccounting volatility risk arises when an exposure is accounted for at amortised cost but economically hedged by a derivative that is accounted for at fair value. Although this is not an economic risk, the difference in accounting between the exposure and the hedge creates volatility in the income statement.\n\nAccounting volatility can be mitigated through hedge accounting. However, residual volatility will remain in cases where accounting rules mean that hedge accounting is not an option, or where there is some hedge ineffectiveness. Accounting volatility risk is reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee monthly and capitalised as part of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n271",

        "page_content": "## Traded market risk Definition (audited)\n\nTraded market risk is the risk arising from changes in fair value on positions, assets, liabilities or commitments in trading portfolios as a result of fluctuations in market prices.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited)\n\nTraded market risk mainly arises from NatWest Group's trading activities. These activities provide a range of financing, risk management and investment services to clients - including corporations and financial institutions - around the world. From a market risk perspective, activities are focused on rates; currencies; and traded credit. NatWest Group undertakes transactions in financial instruments including debt securities, as well as securities financing and derivatives.\n\nAll material traded market risk resides in NatWest Markets. The key categories are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign currency price risk.\n\nTrading activities may also give rise to counterparty credit risk. For further detail refer to the Credit risk section.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d The year was marked by periods of increased market volatility reflecting UK political developments, global inflationary concerns and the invasion of Ukraine\n- \uf02d The significant volatility in Gilts, sterling swaps and inflation entered the rolling window for VaR calculation during 2022. However, traded VaR and SVaR remained within appetite and, on an average basis, decreased compared to 2021, aided by NatWest Group's continued disciplined approach to risk-taking.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nMarket risk policy statements set out the governance and risk management framework. Responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from trading activities lies with the relevant trading business. The Market Risk function independently advises on, monitors and challenges the risk-taking activities undertaken by the trading business ensuring these are within the constraints of the market risk framework, policies, and risk appetite statements and measures.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite for traded market risk is set out in the traded market risk appetite statement. Quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of exposure limits. The limits at NatWest Group level comprise value-at-risk (VaR), stressed value-at-risk (SVaR) and stress-testing limits. More details on these are provided on the following pages.\n\nFor each trading business, a document known as a dealing authority compiles details of all applicable limits and trading restrictions. The desk-level mandates comprise qualitative limits related to the product types within the scope of each desk, as well as quantitative metrics specific to the desk's market risk exposures. These additional limits and metrics aim to control various risk dimensions such as exposure size, aged inventory, currency and tenor.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments and recalibrated to ensure that they remain aligned to NatWest Group RWA targets. Limit reviews focus on optimising the alignment between traded market risk exposure and capital usage.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n272\n\nTo ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers have been set such that if exposures exceed a specified level, action plans are developed by the relevant business and the Market Risk function and implemented. For more detail on risk appetite and risk controls, refer to pages 181 and 182.\n\n## Monitoring and mitigation\n\nTraded market risk is identified and assessed by gathering, analysing, monitoring and reporting market risk information at desk, business, business segment and NatWest Group-wide levels. Industry expertise, continued system developments and techniques such as stress testing are also used to enhance the effectiveness of the identification and assessment of all material market risks.\n\nTraded market risk exposures are monitored against limits and analysed daily. A daily report summarising the position of exposures against limits at desk, business, business segment and NatWest Group levels is provided to senior management and market risk managers across the function. Limit reporting is supplemented with regulatory capital and stress testing information as well as ad-hoc reporting.\n\nA risk review of trading businesses is undertaken weekly with senior risk and front office staff. This includes a review of profit and loss drivers, notable position concentrations and other positions of concern.\n\nBusiness profit and loss performance is monitored automatically through loss triggers which, if breached, require a remedial action plan to be agreed between the Market Risk function and the business. The loss triggers are set using both a fall-from-peak approach and an absolute loss level. In addition, regular updates on traded market risk positions are provided to the Executive Risk Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\n## Measurement\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR, SVaR and the incremental risk charge to measure traded market risk. Risks that are not adequately captured by VaR or SVaR are captured by the Risks Not In VaR (RNIV) framework to ensure that NatWest Group is adequately capitalised for market risk. In addition, stress testing is used to identify any vulnerabilities and potential losses.\n\nThe key inputs into these measurement methods are market data and risk factor sensitivities. Sensitivities refer to the changes in trade or portfolio value that result from small changes in market parameters that are subject to the market risk limit framework. Revaluation ladders are used in place of sensitivities to capture the impact of large moves in risk factors or the joint impact of two risk factors.\n\nThese methods have been designed to capture correlation effects and allow NatWest Group to form an aggregated view of its traded market risk across risk types, markets and business lines while also taking into account the characteristics of each risk type.\n\n## V Vaalluuee--aatt--rriisskk\n\nFor internal risk management purposes, VaR assumes a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal VaR model - which captures all trading book positions including those products approved by the regulator is based on a historical simulation, utilising market data from the previous 500 days on an equally-weighted basis.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Traded market risk continued\n\nThe model also captures the potential impact of interest rate risk; credit spread risk; foreign currency price risk; equity price risk; and commodity price risk.\n\nWhen simulating potential movements in such risk factors, a combination of absolute, relative and rescaled returns is used.\n\nThe performance and adequacy of the VaR model are tested regularly through the following processes:\n\n- \uf02d Back-testing: Internal and regulatory back-testing is conducted on a daily basis. Information on internal backtesting is provided in this section. Information on regulatory back-testing appears in the Pillar 3 Report.\n- \uf02d Ongoing model validation: VaR model performance is assessed both regularly, and on an ad-hoc basis, if market conditions or portfolio profile change significantly.\n- \uf02d Model Risk Management review: As part of the model lifecycle, all risk models (including the VaR model) are independently reviewed to ensure the model is still fit for purpose given current market conditions and portfolio profile. For further detail on the independent model validation carried out by Model Risk Management refer to page 282.

SVaR is a VaR-based measure using historical data from a one-year period of stressed market conditions.\n\nA simulation of 99% VaR is run on the current portfolio for each 250-day period from 2005 to the current VaR date, moving forward one day at a time. The SVaR is the worst VaR outcome of the simulated results.\n\nThis is in contrast with VaR, which is based on a rolling 500-day historical data set. A time horizon of ten trading days is assumed with a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal traded SVaR model captures all trading book positions.\n\n|                            | 2022       | 2022       | 2022       | 2022          | 2021       | 2021       | 2021       | 2021          |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|\n|                            | Average \u00a3m | Maximum \u00a3m | Minimum \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m | Average \u00a3m | Maximum \u00a3m | Minimum \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m |\n| Total internal traded SVaR | 70         | 206        | 34         | 40            | 95         | 175        | 46         | 66            |\n\n## R Riisskkss  NNoott  IInn  VVaaRR  ((RRNNIIVVss))\n\nThe RNIV framework is used to identify and quantify market risks that are not fully captured by the internal VaR and SVaR models.\n\nRNIV calculations form an integral part of ongoing model and data improvement efforts to capture all market risks in scope for model approval in VaR and SVaR.\n\nFor further qualitative and quantitative disclosures on RNIVs, refer to the Market risk section of the Pillar 3 Report.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n274\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg\n\nFor information on stress testing, refer to page 182.\n\n## I Innccrreemmeennttaall  rriisskk  cchhaarrggee  ((IIRRCC))\n\nThe IRC model quantifies the impact of rating migration and default events on the market value of instruments with embedded credit risk (in particular, bonds and credit default swaps) held in the trading book.

        "page_content": "## Pension risk Definition\n\nPension risk is defined in a consistent manner to the regulatory definition as the inability to meet contractual obligations and other liabilities to the established employee or related company pension scheme.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to pension risk through its defined benefit schemes worldwide. The Main section of The NatWest Group Pension Fund (the Main section) is the largest source of pension risk with \u00a334.0 billion of assets and \u00a324.7 billion of liabilities at 31 December 2022 (2021 - \u00a352.0 billion of assets and \u00a342.0 billion of liabilities). Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, for further details on NatWest Group's pension obligations, including sensitivities to the main risk factors.\n\nPension scheme liabilities vary with changes in long-term interest rates and inflation as well as with pensionable salaries, the longevity of scheme members and legislation. Pension scheme assets vary with changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, credit spreads, exchange rates, and equity and property prices. NatWest Group is exposed to the risk that the schemes' assets, together with future returns and additional future contributions, are estimated to be insufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due. In such circumstances, NatWest Group could be obliged (or might choose) to make additional contributions to the schemes or be required to hold additional capital to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d There were no material changes to NatWest Group's exposure to pension risk during the year. Despite market volatility, the Main section remained resilient, primarily due to its interest rate and inflation hedging strategy, as well as its limited exposure to equities. Furthermore, the Main section held sufficient collateral in relation to its liability hedging portfolio, without the need to sell assets to meet collateral requirements. Some of NatWest Group's smaller schemes faced more challenging dynamics, with reductions in funding levels, but continued to be able to raise collateral as required. Any impact was not material at NatWest Group level.\n- \uf02d In line with the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Trustee of the Main section in April 2018, a \u00a3500 million lump sum contribution was paid into the Main section, following the share buyback in Q1 2022.\n- \uf02d Since 31 December 2022, it has been agreed with the Trustee of the Main section, that remaining contributions of \u00a3471 million previously due to the Main section under the Memorandum of Understanding signed in April 2018, will instead be paid into a new legal structure. For further details, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n- \uf02d As part of the ongoing phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland, in December 2022, an agreement was reached with the Trustees of NatWest Group's defined benefit pension schemes in the Republic of Ireland to secure the long-term strategy for the schemes.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n276\n\n## Governance\n\nChaired by the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Asset & Liability Management Committee is a key component of NatWest Group's approach to managing pension risk. It considers the pension impact of the capital plan for NatWest Group and reviews the performance of NatWest Group's material pension funds and other issues material to NatWest Group's pension strategy. It also considers investment strategy proposals from the Trustee of the Main section.\n\nFor further information on governance, refer to page 179.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group maintains an independent view of the risk inherent in its pension funds. NatWest Group has an annually reviewed pension risk appetite statement incorporating defined metrics against which risk is measured.\n\nPolicies and standards are in place to provide formal controls for pension risk reporting, modelling, governance and stress testing. A pension risk policy, which sits within the NatWest Group enterprise-wide risk management framework, is also in place and is subject to associated framework controls.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nPension risk is monitored by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee, whilst the Asset & Liability Management Committee receives updates on the performance of NatWest Group's material pension funds.\n\nNatWest Group also undertakes stress tests on its material defined benefit pension schemes each year. These tests are also used to satisfy the requests of regulatory bodies such as the Bank of England.\n\nThe stress testing framework includes pension risk capital calculations for the purposes of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process as well as additional stress tests for a number of internal management purposes. The results of the stress tests and their consequential impact on NatWest Group's balance sheet, income statement and capital position are incorporated into the overall NatWest Group stress test results.\n\nNatWest Bank Plc (a subsidiary of NatWest Group) is the principal employer of the Main section and could be required to fund any deficit that arises.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFollowing risk mitigation measures taken by the Trustee in recent years, the Main section is now well protected against interest rate and inflation risks and is being run on a low investment risk basis with relatively small equity risk exposure. The Main section also uses derivatives to manage the allocation of the portfolio to different asset classes and to manage risk within asset classes.\n\nThe potential impact of climate change is one of the factors considered in managing the assets of the Main section. The Trustee monitors the risk to its investments from changes in the global economy and invests, where return justifies the risk, in sectors that reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels, or that may otherwise promote environmental benefits. Further details regarding the Main section Trustee's approach to managing climate change risk can be found in its Responsible Ownership Policy and its net zero commitment. During the year, the Trustee also produced its first climate disclosures as required by The Occupational Pension Schemes (Climate Change Governance and Reporting) Regulations 2021.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Compliance and conduct risk Definition\n\nCompliance risk is the risk that NatWest Group fails to observe the letter and spirit of all relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice.\n\nConduct risk is the risk of inappropriate behaviour towards customers, or in the markets in which NatWest Group operates, which leads to unfair or inappropriate customer outcomes.\n\nThe consequences of failing to meet compliance and/or conduct responsibilities can be significant and could result, for example, in legal action, regulatory enforcement, material financial loss and/or reputational damage.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nCompliance and conduct risks exist across all stages of NatWest Group's relationships with its customers and arise from a variety of activities including product design, marketing and sales, complaint handling, staff training, and handling of confidential inside information.\n\nAs set out in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, members of NatWest Group are party to legal proceedings and are subject to investigation and other regulatory action in the UK, the US and other jurisdictions.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d Further progress was made on the compliance agenda during 2022. The first line of defence ring-fencing hub which was established to provide an aggregated view of ring-fencing compliance and risk management continues to work across business segments, functions and legal entities.\n- \uf02d From a conduct risk perspective, the focus on consumer protection increased significantly during 2022, given the cost-of-living challenges and their impact on customers in vulnerable situations. The FCA's increased expectations under its Consumer Duty initiative was also a key development, and the establishment of the consumer duty 'One Bank' programme will ensure continued focus on the required 'paradigm shift' in the levels of consumer protection.\n- \uf02d In December 2021, NatWest Markets Plc pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud, related to historical spoofing conduct by former employees in US Treasuries markets, between 2008 and 2014 and, separately, during approximately three months in 2018. In line with the plea agreement with DOJ, an independent monitor was appointed in 2022. The monitor will be engaged in working with NatWest Markets over a threeyear period.\n- \uf02d More generally, work is also ongoing to further enhance the conduct and compliance risk framework so that it is aligned to a wider programme of work on the overall risk management framework.\n\n## Governance\n\nNatWest Group defines appropriate standards of compliance and conduct and ensures adherence to those standards through its risk management framework. Relevant compliance and conduct matters are escalated through the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n277\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite for compliance and conduct risks is set at Board level. Risk appetite statements articulate the levels of risk that legal entities, businesses and functions work within when pursuing their strategic objectives and business plans.\n\nA range of controls are operated to ensure the business delivers good customer outcomes and are conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. A suite of policies addressing compliance and conduct risks set appropriate standards across NatWest Group. Examples include policies relating to customers in vulnerable situations, complaints management, cross-border activities and market abuse. Continuous monitoring and targeted assurance are carried out as appropriate.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nCompliance and conduct risks are measured and managed through continuous assessment and reporting to NatWest Group's senior risk committees and at Board level. The compliance and conduct risk framework facilitates the consistent monitoring and measurement of compliance with laws and regulations and the delivery of consistently good customer outcomes. The first line of defence is responsible for effective risk identification, reporting and monitoring, with oversight, challenge and review by the second line. Compliance and conduct risk management is also integrated into NatWest Group's strategic planning cycle.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nActivity to mitigate the most material compliance and conduct risks is carried out across NatWest Group with specific areas of focus in the customer-facing businesses and legal entities. Examples of mitigation include consideration of customer needs in business and product planning, targeted training, conflicts of interest management, market conduct surveillance, complaints management, mapping of priority regulatory requirements and independent monitoring activity. Internal policies help support a strong customer focus across NatWest Group.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\n## Definition\n\nFinancial crime risk is the risk that NatWest Group's products and services are intentionally or unintentionally used to facilitate financial crime in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions and tax evasion, as well as external or internal fraud.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nFinancial crime risk may be present if NatWest Group's customers, employees or third parties undertake or facilitate financial crime, or if NatWest Group's products or services are used intentionally or unintentionally to facilitate such crime. Financial crime risk is an inherent risk across all lines of business.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d Significant investment continued to be made to support delivery of the multi-year transformation plan across financial crime risk management.\n- \uf02d Enhancements were made to technology and data analytics to improve the effectiveness of systems used to monitor customers and transactions.\n- \uf02d A financial crime and fraud goal was rolled out to approximately 55,000 colleagues across NatWest Group.",

In January 2022, NatWest Group received the Skilled Person's final report in connection with governance arrangements for two financial crime change programmes in respect of which the Skilled Person had been appointed under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to provide assurance. The FCA confirmed in March 2022 that the section 166 review had been concluded.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Financial Crime Executive Steering Group, which is jointly chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and the Group Chief Information Officer (previously the Chief Administration Officer), is the core governance committee for financial crime risk (excluding fraud). It oversees financial crime risk management, operational performance, and transformation matters including decision-making and escalations to the Executive Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and NatWest Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe Fraud Executive Steering Group, which is chaired by the Chief Information Officer, is the core governance committee for fraud. It oversees fraud risk management, operational performance, and investment matters including decisionmaking and escalations to relevant senior committees.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThere is no appetite to operate in an environment where systems and controls do not enable the effective identification, assessment, monitoring, management and mitigation of financial crime risk. NatWest Group's systems and controls must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its businesses\n\nNatWest Group operates a framework with preventative and detective controls designed to mitigate the risk that it could facilitate financial crime. These controls are supported by a suite of policies, procedures and guidance to ensure they operate effectively.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nFinancial crime risks are identified and reported through continuous risk management and regular reporting to senior risk committees and the NatWest Group Board. Quantitative and qualitative data is reviewed and assessed to measure whether financial crime risk is within risk appetite.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThrough the financial crime framework, relevant policies, systems, processes and controls are used to mitigate and manage financial crime risk. This includes the use of dedicated screening and monitoring systems and controls to identify people, organisations, transactions and behaviours that may require further investigation or other actions. Centralised expertise is available to detect and disrupt threats to NatWest Group and its customers.\n\nIntelligence is shared with law enforcement, regulators and government bodies to strengthen national and international defences against those who would misuse the financial system for criminal motives.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n278\n\n## Climate risk\n\n## Definition\n\nClimate risk is the threat of financial loss or adverse nonfinancial impacts associated with climate change and the political, economic and environmental responses to it.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nPhysical risks may arise from climate and weather-related events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises. They can potentially result in financial losses, impairing asset values and the creditworthiness of borrowers. NatWest Group could be exposed to physical risks directly by the effects on its property portfolio and, indirectly, by the impacts on the wider economy as well as on the property and business interests of its customers.\n\nTransition risks may arise from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and sentiment could prompt reassessment of customers' financial risk and may lead to falls in the value of a large range of assets. NatWest Group could be exposed to transition risks directly through the costs of adaptation within economic sectors and markets as well as supply chain disruption leading to financial impacts on it and its customers. Potential indirect effects include the erosion of NatWest Group's competitiveness, profitability, reputational damage and liability risk.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d The enhancement of scenario generation capability, building on our internal scenario analysis capability developed over 2021 that supported risk management and participation in the PRA Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES).\n- \uf02d To support the management of credit risk, the application of first generation qualitative climate risk scorecards within customer conversations, and initiation of testing of enhanced scorecards including quantitative elements.\n- \uf02d Improved oversight of management of climate-related risk through regular reporting and review of climate risk appetite measures and key risk indicator trends informing monthly risk committee updates.\n- \uf02d The assessment of potential greenwashing risks driven by a hypothetical risk scenario where increased competition in the green finance market leads to less efficient product designs and diminished robustness of governance.\n- \uf02d The preparation of an initial iteration of the NatWest Group Climate Transition plan including identification and analysis of potential impacts associated with proposed actions.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board is responsible for monitoring and overseeing climate-related risk within NatWest Group's overall business strategy and risk appetite. The potential impact, likelihood and preparedness of climate-related risk are reported regularly to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer shares accountability with the CEO under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime for identifying and managing the financial risks arising from climate change. This includes ensuring that the financial risks from climate change are adequately reflected in risk management frameworks, and that NatWest Group can identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on its exposure to these risks.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Climate risk continued\n\nThe Climate Change Executive Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the direction of and progress against NatWest Group's climate-related commitments. During 2022, the Executive Steering Group focused on overseeing the preparation of the initial iteration of NatWest Group's Climate Transition Plan, progression in establishing partnerships and opportunities including oversight of progress against the NatWest Group climate and sustainable funding and financing target, and ensuring the effective management of climaterelated risks. The Executive Steering Group will continue to supervise strategic implementation and delivery, supported by the Climate Centre of Excellence.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's ambition is to be a leading bank in the UK in helping to address climate change. This ambition is underpinned by activity to reduce the climate impact of financing activity by at least 50% by 2030 and to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\nWork continued in 2022 to mature NatWest Group's climaterelated risk capabilities in accordance with the risk management framework. In December 2022, the Board approved the adoption of enhanced climate risk appetite measures into the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which are designed to provide a heightened focus on balance sheet exposure to financed emissions.\n\nCombined with segment-specific risk measures, this suite of metrics will enable reporting of climate risk appetite to senior risk management forums and links risk management to NatWest Group's strategic goals and priorities.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nNatWest Group focused on developing the capabilities to use scenario analysis to identify the most material climate risks and opportunities for its customers, seeking to harness insights to inform risk management practices and maximise the opportunities arising from a transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nScenario analysis allows NatWest Group to test a range of possible future climate pathways and understand the nature and magnitude of the risks they present. The purpose of scenario analysis is not to forecast the future but to understand and prepare to manage risks that could arise.\n\nKey priorities in 2022 have included enhancing our climate scenario analysis capabilities to both address ongoing regulatory expectations and building on the infrastructure required by NatWest Group to meet current and future climate scenario analysis objectives. NatWest Group made significant investment in developing a variety of internal scenario analysis tools which support the development of commercial strategy, products and services and help manage risks, including managing exposures efficiently and removing unmitigated risks from future climate impacts.\n\nNatWest Group recognises a number of key use cases for climate scenario analysis, including, but not restricted to, the following:\n\n- \uf02d Regulatory stress testing requirements.\n- \uf02d Heightened climate risk sector classifications.\n- \uf02d Sector/sub-sector risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Lending pricing.\n- \uf02d Portfolio management.\n- \uf02d Strategic decision-making.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n279\n\nNatWest Group made material progress in developing internal climate modelling capabilities, building on the learnings from our internal scenario analysis carried out in 2021 and participation in the CBES. NatWest Group has enhanced its scenario generation capabilities to support future integration of climate risk into strategic planning, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP) and IFRS 9. Modelling infrastructure to execute scenarios matured in 2022, giving increased flexibility for scenario analysis capability for short, medium and long-term scenarios. Incorporation into the NatWest Group strategic plan and ICAAP ensures that NatWest Group factors climate into strategic planning and appropriately capitalises for the most material source of climate risk over the capital planning horizon. Developing internal methodologies also enhances the capacity to integrate scenario analysis with customer journeys. This builds on NatWest Group's ability not only to effectively develop tools for risk management but also to develop products and processes that support NatWest Group's customers' transition.\n\nNatWest Group also focused on developing an internal methodology for forecasting its counterparties' corporate transition risk via counterparty level modelling infrastructure and climate risk customer scorecards. NatWest Group is actively targeting the minimisation of reliance on third party models, whilst recognising there is likely to be some reliance on them over the medium-to-long term given the specialist and evolving nature of climate financial risk management. Enhancement of this infrastructure links very closely with the scenario analysis noted above. Further information on this can be found in NatWest Group's 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\nInternal scenario analysis carried out to support participation in the CBES focused on the application of three climate scenarios (early policy action, late policy action and no additional action and a counterfactual scenario) to quantify climate risk across NatWest Group's lending portfolio. This showed that NatWest Group was most exposed to a late transition scenario with a concentrated period of losses between 2030 and 2035, the point at which disruptive transition policy is implemented, resulting in an economic recession. The early action scenario resulted in more gradual losses through the stress horizon, with the earlier onset of transition curtailing impairments in comparison to the sharp onset in the late action scenario. A key conclusion for transition risk is that supporting customers' transition to net zero is critical to manage NatWest Group's exposures to transition risk.\n\nThe effects of physical risk were explored through the no additional action scenario which produced lower total cumulative impairments compared to the early action and late action scenarios. This comparatively lower level of impairments is reflective of NatWest Group's diversified book and geographic exposure. NatWest Group's results broadly aligned with the key findings and aggregate outcome for banks (across both physical and transition risk).",

        "page_content": "## Climate risk continued\n\nHowever, NatWest Group recognises the industry data and methodology limitations for physical risk and therefore recognises that the no additional action scenario does not capture the severe long-term effects of irreversible climate change. Further information on results, limitations and conclusions can be found in NatWest Group's 2022 Climaterelated Disclosures Report.\n\nThere are a number of challenges with climate scenario analysis, for example in relation to climate data. NatWest Group continues to participate in a number of industry forums including the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking, which provides a unique framework for banks to align strategy and practice with the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Climate Agreement. In addition, NatWest Group is also represented on the Climate Financial Risk Forum established by the PRA and FCA to shape the financial services industry's response to the challenges posed by climate risk and continues to work with a number of UK and international bodies to develop climate scenario analysis best practices.\n\nNatWest Group is continuing to make progress in embedding climate risk analytics as appropriate across customer journeys and in supporting decision-making at customer and strategic portfolio levels. Leveraging qualitative and quantitative outputs from scenario analysis, will enable NatWest Group to integrate outcomes into risk appetite measures and customer origination processes. Developing the ability to incorporate these outcomes enables NatWest Group to manage and mitigate both the risks but also the opportunities that are presented by climate risk.\n\n## Operational risk Definition\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. It arises from day-to-day operations and is relevant to every aspect of the business.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nOperational risk may arise from a failure to manage operations, systems, transactions and assets appropriately. This can take the form of human error, an inability to deliver change adequately or on time, the non-availability of technology services, or the loss of customer data. Systems failure, theft of NatWest Group property, information loss and the impact of natural, or man-made, disasters - as well as the threat of cyber-attacks - are sources of operational risk. Operational risk can also arise from a failure to account for changes in law or regulations or to take appropriate measures to protect assets.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d A review of the NatWest Group Risk Directory was completed, allowing greater risk visibility and improved risk reporting.\n- \uf02d The NatWest Group Impact Classification Matrix was updated to align to industry materiality, ensuring focus on the most material risks.\n- \uf02d An Early Event Escalation Process was implemented to ensure material events are escalated in a timely manner.\n- \uf02d A Risk & Control Self-Assessment approach was developed to identify risks across end-to-end processes, refocusing existing risk assessment, towards materiality.\n- \uf02d A payments review has been initiated in late 2022 to assess control enhancements in response to manual payment risk.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n280\n\n## Governance\n\nThe governance arrangements in place for operational risk are aligned to the requirements set out in the Board approved enterprise-wide risk management framework and are consistent with achieving safety, soundness and sustainable risk outcomes.\n\nAligned to this, a strong operational risk management oversight function is vital to support NatWest Group's ambitions to serve its customers better. Improved management of operational risk against defined appetite is vital for stability and reputational integrity.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOperational risk appetite supports effective management of all operational risks. It expresses the level and types of operational risk NatWest Group is willing to accept to achieve its strategic objectives and business plans. NatWest Group's operational risk appetite statement encompasses the full range of operational risks faced by its legal entities, businesses and functions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Control Environment Certification (CEC) process is a halfyearly self-assessment by the CEOs of NatWest Group's customer-facing business areas, as well as the heads of the bank's support functions. It provides a consistent and comparable view on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nCEC covers material risks and the underlying key controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, as well as their supporting risk management frameworks. The CEC outcomes, including forward-looking assessments for the next two half-yearly cycles and progress on control environment improvements, are reported to the Group Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. They are also shared with external auditors.\n\nThe CEC process helps to ensure compliance with the NatWest Group Policy Framework, Sarbanes-Oxley 404 requirements concerning internal control over financial reporting and certain requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nRisks are mitigated by applying key preventative and detective controls This is an integral step in the risk self-assessment methodology which determines residual risk exposure. Control owners are accountable for the design, execution, performance and maintenance of key controls. Key controls are regularly assessed for adequacy and tested for effectiveness. The results are monitored and, where a material change in performance is identified, the associated risk is re-evaluated.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRisk and control self-assessments are used across all business areas and support functions to identify and assess material operational risks, conduct risks and key controls. All risks and controls are mapped to NatWest Group's Risk Directory. Risk assessments are refreshed at least annually to ensure they remain relevant and that they capture any emerging risks and also ensure that these risks are reassessed.\n\nThe process is designed to confirm that risks are effectively managed in line with risk appetite. Controls are tested at the appropriate frequency to verify that they remain fit-for-purpose and operate effectively to reduce the identified risks.\n\nNatWest Group uses the standardised approach to calculate its Pillar 1 operational risk capital requirement. This is based on multiplying three years' average historical gross income by coefficients set by the regulator based on business line.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Operational risk continued\n\nAs part of the wider Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process an operational risk economic capital model is used to assess Pillar 2A, which is a risk-sensitive add-on to Pillar 1. The model uses historical loss data (internal and external) and forward-looking scenario analysis to provide a risk-sensitive view of NatWest Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement.\n\nScenario analysis is used to assess how severe but plausible operational risks will affect NatWest Group. It provides a forward-looking basis for evaluating and managing operational risk exposures.\n\nRefer to the Capital, liquidity and funding risk section for the operational risk capital requirement figures.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nNatWest Group manages and monitors operational resilience through its risk and control self-assessment methodology. This is underpinned by setting and monitoring of risk indicators and performance metrics for the operational resilience of key business services. Progress continued on embedding regulator expectations for operational resilience, with involvement in a number of industry-wide operational resilience forums. This enables a cross-sector view of the operational resilience risk profile and the pace of ongoing innovation and change, both internally and externally.\n\nNatWest Group operates layered security controls and its network architecture is designed to provide inherent protection against threats. This approach avoids reliance on any one type or method of security control. Minimum security control requirements are set out in Key Risk policies, standards, processes and procedures.  Through 2023 NatWest Group will monitor and manage the threat landscape focusing on:\n\n- \uf02d Attack Surface Vulnerabilities - such as the rising number of zero-days and code vulnerabilities impacting organisations\n- \uf02d Initial Access Brokers and Nation States - increasingly sophisticated attacks from ransomware gangs and ongoing challenges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has raised international tensions increasing the likelihood of disruptive cyber-attacks.\n\n|                                            | Value of events   | Value of events   | Value of events   | Value of events   | Volume of events (1)   | Volume of events (1)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                            | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m                | Proportion        | Proportion        | Proportion             | Proportion             |\n|                                            | 2022              | 2021              | 2022              | 2021              | 2022                   | 2021                   |\n| Fraud                                      | 34                | 71                | 17%               | 16%               | 90%                    | 81%                    |\n| Clients, products and business practices   | 153               | 366               | 76%               | 80%               | 2%                     | 7%                     |\n| Execution, delivery and process management | 14                | 9                 | 7%                | 2%                | 7%                     | 8%                     |\n| Employment practices and workplace safety  | -                 | 6                 | -                 | 1%                | 1%                     | 3%                     |\n| Technology and infrastructure failures     | 1                 | 3                 | -                 | 1%                | -                      | 1%                     |\n| Disasters and public safety                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                      | -                      |\n|                                            | 202               | 455               | 100%              | 100%              | 100%                   | 100%                   |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n281\n\nAs cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group continues to invest in additional capability designed to defend against emerging threats.\n\n## E Evveenntt  aanndd  lloossss  ddaattaa  mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe operational risk event and loss data management process ensures NatWest Group captures and records operational risk financial and non-financial events that meet defined criteria. Loss data is used for regulatory and industry reporting and is included in capital modelling when calculating economic capital for operational risk. The most serious events are escalated in a simple, standardised process to all senior management, by way of a 'Early Event Escalation Process'.\n\nAll financial impacts and recoveries associated with an operational risk event are reported against the date they were recorded in NatWest Group's financial accounts. A single event can result in multiple losses (or recoveries) that may take time to crystallise. Losses and recoveries with a financial accounting date in 2021 may relate to events that occurred, or were identified in, prior years.

NatWest Group defines a model as a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, accounting, mathematical or data science theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group uses a variety of models in the course of its business activities. Examples include the use of model outputs to support customer decisioning, measuring and assessing risk exposures (including credit, market, and climate risk), as well as calculating regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nModel applications may give rise to different risks depending on the business segment in which they are used. Model risk is therefore assessed separately for each business segment in addition to the overall assessment made for NatWest Group.\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d NatWest Group's model risk management practices continued to evolve, driven through a dedicated Model Management Programme. This delivered an enhanced model management committee structure, a new model risk governance team operating model and an improved model inventory.\n- \uf02d Aligned to the implementation of the enterprise-wide risk management framework, new model risk management procedures were approved to support the identification, assessment and monitoring of model risk.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group provided a comprehensive response to the PRA's Consultation Paper on Model Risk Management (CP6/22). A self-assessment of the bank's current Model Risk Policy compared to the PRA's draft Supervisory Statement was completed and gaps identified. A programme of work will be established in 2023 to continue to evolve the bank's model risk management framework in line with regulatory expectations and industry best practice.\n\n## Governance\n\nA governance framework is in place to ensure policies and processes relating to models are appropriate and effective. Two roles are key to this - model risk owners and model risk officers. Model risk owners are responsible for model approval and ongoing performance monitoring. Model risk officers, in the second line, are responsible for oversight, including ensuring that models are independently validated prior to use and on an ongoing basis aligned to the model's risk rating. Model risk matters are escalated to senior management in several ways.\n\nThese include model risk oversight committees, as well as the relevant business and function model management committees.\n\nA new NatWest Group Model Risk Oversight Committee will further enhance model risk governance by providing a direct escalation route to the NatWest Group Executive Risk Committee and, where applicable, onwards to the NatWest Group Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nModel risk appetite is set in order to limit the level of model risk that NatWest Group is willing to accept in the course of its business activities. The model risk appetite statement and measures are approved by the board on BRC's recommendation. Business areas are responsible for monitoring performance against appetite and remediating models outside appetite.\n\n282\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nPolicies and procedures related to the development, validation, approval, implementation, use and ongoing monitoring of models are in place to ensure adequate control across the lifecycle of an individual model.\n\nValidation of material models is conducted by an independent risk function comprising of skilled, well-informed subject matter experts. This is completed for new models or amendments to existing models and as part of an ongoing periodic programme to assess model performance. The frequency of periodic validation is aligned to the risk rating of the model. The independent validation focuses on a variety of model features, including modelling approach, the nature of the assumptions used, the model's predictive ability and complexity, the data used in the model, its implementation and its compliance with regulation.\n\nThe level of risk relating to an individual model is assessed through a model risk rating. A quantitative approach is used to determine the risk rating of each model, based on the model's materiality and validation rating. This approach provides the basis for model risk appetite measures and enables model risk to be robustly monitored and managed across NatWest Group.\n\nOngoing performance monitoring is conducted by model owners and overseen by the model validators to ensure parameter estimates and model constructs remain fit for purpose, model assumptions remain valid and that models are being used consistently with their intended purpose. This allows timely action to be taken to remediate poor model performance and/or any control gaps or weaknesses.\n\nIf a model risk issue arises due to an operational control weakness (and the residual risk meets the operational risk thresholds, then an operational risk issue would be raised.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nBy their nature - as approximations of reality - model risk is inherent in the use of models. It is managed by refining or redeveloping models where appropriate - due to changes in market conditions, business assumptions or processes - and by applying adjustments to model outputs (either quantitative or based on expert opinion). Enhancements may also be made to the process within which the model output is used in order to further limit risk levels.\n\n## Reputational risk Definition\n\nReputational risk is defined as the risk of damage to stakeholder trust due to negative consequences arising from internal actions or external events.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nReputational risks can originate from internal actions and external events. The three primary drivers of reputational risk have been identified as: failure in internal execution; a conflict between NatWest Group's values and the public agenda; and contagion (when NatWest Group's reputation is damaged by failures in the wider financial sector).\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Reputational risk continued\n\n## Key developments in 2022\n\n- \uf02d A new reputational risk policy was implemented to manage reputational risk at an organisational level.\n- \uf02d The NatWest Group Reputational Risk Register was further embedded into the organisation, the results of which are reported to the NatWest Group Reputational Risk Committee.\n- \uf02d All Environmental, Social & Ethical (ESE) risk acceptance criteria underwent a review to align with Our Purpose.\n\n## Governance\n\nA reputational risk policy supports reputational risk management across NatWest Group. Reputational risk committees review relevant issues at an individual business or entity level, while the NatWest Group Reputational Risk\n\nCommittee opines on issues, cases, sectors and themes that represent material reputational risks. The NatWest Group Board Risk Committee oversees the identification and reporting of reputational risk.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group manages and articulates its appetite for reputational risk through a qualitative reputational risk appetite statement and associated quantitative measures. NatWest Group seeks to identify, measure and manage risk aligned to stakeholder trust. However, reputational risk is inherent in NatWest Group's operating environment and public trust is a specific factor in setting reputational risk appetite.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n283\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRelevant internal and external factors are monitored through regular reporting to the reputational risk committees at business or entity level and escalated, where appropriate, to the NatWest Group Reputational Risk Committee or the NatWest Group Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nStandards of conduct are in place across NatWest Group requiring strict adherence to policies, procedures and ways of working to ensure business is transacted in a way that meets or exceeds - stakeholder expectations.\n\nExternal events that could cause reputational damage are identified and mitigated through NatWest Group's Top and Emerging Threats process (where sufficiently material) as well as through the NatWest Group and business segment-level risk registers.\n\nNatWest Group has in recent years been the subject of investigations and reviews by a number of regulators and governmental authorities, some of which have resulted in past fines, settlements and public censure.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## I Innddeeppeennddeennccee\n\nWe are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## C Coonncclluussiioonnss  rreellaattiinngg  ttoo  ggooiinngg  ccoonncceerrnn\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \uf02d In conjunction with our walkthrough of the Group's financial close process, we confirmed our understanding of management's Going Concern assessment process and also engaged with management early to ensure all key factors were considered in their assessment;\n- \uf02d We evaluated management's going concern assessment which included reviewing their evaluation of long-term business and strategic plans, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding positions. It also assessed these positions considering internal stress tests which included consideration of principal and emerging risks. The Group's risk profile and risk management practices were considered including credit risk, market risk, compliance and conduct risk, climate risk and operational risk;\n- \uf02d We evaluated management's assessment by considering the Group's ability to continue in operation and meets its liabilities under different scenarios including the impact of the Group's strategic plans, and the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook. We used economic specialists in assessing the macroeconomic assumptions in the forecast through benchmarking to institutional forecasts, HMT consensus and peer comparative economic forecasts. We also considered other commitments of the Group including those in respect of its subsidiaries;\n- \uf02d Considered the results of the Bank's stress testing and Bank of England 2022 solvency stress test; and\n- \uf02d We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n286\n\n## Parent Company\n\n- \uf02d Balance sheet as at 31 December 2022;\n- \uf02d Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;\n- \uf02d Cash flow statement for the year then ended; and\n- \uf02d Related notes 1 to 12 to the financial statements including a summary of critical accounting policies\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account the size and risk profile of the component and its activities, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the four reporting components of the Group, we selected four components based on size and risk, which represent the principal reporting legal entities within the Group.\n\nThe scoping for the current year is as follows:\n\n| Component              | Scope    | Key locations                                   |\n|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| NatWest Holdings (NWH) | Full     | United Kingdom                                  |\n| NatWest Markets (NWM)  | Full     | United Kingdom, United States, and  Netherlands |\n| RBS International      | Specific | Channel Islands                                 |\n| RBS AA Holdings        | Specific | United Kingdom                                  |\n\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams. We considered total assets, total equity and total income to verify we had appropriate overall coverage.\n\n|              | Full scope (1)   | Specific scope (2)   | Other procedures (3)   | Total   |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Total assets | 94%              | 6%                   | 0%                     | 100%    |\n| Total equity | 92%              | 8%                   | 0%                     | 100%    |\n| Total income | 95%              | 4%                   | 1%                     | 100%    |\n\nThe audit scope of the specific scope components may not have included testing of all significant accounts within the components. However, the testing will have contributed to the total coverage of significant accounts tested for the overall Group.\n\n## I Innvvoollvveemmeenntt  wwiitthh  ccoommppoonneenntt  tteeaammss\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.\n\nThe primary audit engagement team interacted regularly with the component audit teams where appropriate throughout the course of the audit, which included holding planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status of the audits, reviewing key working papers and taking responsibility for the scope and direction of the audit process. The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of oversight visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor, or another Group audit partner, has ongoing interaction with all full scope and specific scope locations outside the United Kingdom. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams and maintained a continuous and open dialogue with component teams, as well as holding formal closing meetings quarterly, to ensure that the primary team were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. The primary team also reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements\n\n## C Clliimmaattee  cchhaannggee\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact the Group. The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from credit risk, operational risk, reputational risk, conduct risk and regulatory compliance risk. These are explained in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures in the Strategic Report, and in the Climate Risk section within the Risk and capital management section. The Group has also explained their climate commitments in the Strategic Report. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information', rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n287",

        "page_content": "The Group has explained in the Accounting Policy note how they have reflected the impact of climate change in their financial statements, and the significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change. These disclosures also explain the uncertainty regarding policy response, including the effect of wider geo-political uncertainty on governmental ambitions regarding climate transition and the effect of decarbonisation on wider economic growth and customer behaviours. Many of the impacts arising will be longer term in nature, with an inherent level of uncertainty, and have limited effect on accounting judgments and estimates for the current period under the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards and IFRS as issued by the IASB. The Group has also explained within the Accounting Policies, their approach to quantifying the impact of climate transition policy on macroeconomic factors in the future years, and the limitations on the ability to make a reliable estimate for 2022 reporting.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating the Group's assessment of the impact of climate risk, their climate commitments and the significant judgements and estimates disclosed in the Accounting Policies, and whether these have been appropriately reflected in the asset values where these are impacted by future cash flows, and in the timing and nature of liabilities recognised following the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards and IFRS as issued by the IASB. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change specialists, to determine the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit. We also evaluated the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work we have considered the impact of climate change on the financial statements to impact certain key audit matters.

These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n288\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n| R Riisskk Expected Credit Loss Provisions  At 31 December 2022 the Group reported total  gross loans - amortised cost and FVOCI of  \u00a3377.2 billion (2021: \u00a3369.8 billion) and \u00a33.4  billion of expected credit losses (ECL) (2021: \u00a33.8  billion).   | O \uf02d                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Management's judgments and estimates are                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Ouurr  rreessppoonnssee  ttoo  tthhee  rriisskk Controls testing - We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of  controls across the processes relevant to ECL, including the judgments and  estimates noted.

This assessment included the latest developments related to the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook at 31 December 2022.  We assessed whether forecasted macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index, Bank of England base rates and the House Price Index were complete and appropriate. With the support of our modelling specialists we evaluated the correlation and translation of the macroeconomic factors to the ECL.\n\nPost Model Adjustments (PMAs) - We evaluated and tested the appropriateness, adequacy and completeness of PMAs held at year end, including those applied in response to the current geopolitical and economic outlook and the impact of certain economic factors. This included challenging the identification of retail customers vulnerable to price and rate increases and the identification of commercial sub-sectors more susceptible to inflation and supply chain issues as well as the method by which those PMAs were measured. We have also challenged those PMAs which continued to be applied as a result of COVID-19 related to recovery periods and the associated debt issued to borrowers that obtained government supported loans during Covid-19. With our modelling specialists, we assessed the risk of bias and the completeness of these adjustments by considering the data, judgments, methodology, sensitivities, and governance of these adjustments as well as considering model shortcomings.\n\nIndividual provisions - We recalculated and challenged the scenarios, assumptions and cash flows for a sample of individual provisions including the alternative scenarios and evaluating probability weights assigned, involving EY valuation specialists where appropriate.  The sample was based on a number of factors, including higher risk sectors identified with reference to external sources, such as commercial real estate, agriculture, oil and gas, mining, retail and leisure, and materiality. We considered the impact of the current geopolitical and economic outlook and climate change had on collateral valuations and time to collect as well as whether planned exit strategies remained viable.\n\nDisclosure - We tested the data flows used to populate the disclosures and assessed the adequacy of disclosures for compliance with the accounting standards and regulatory considerations.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that provisions for the impairment of loans were reasonable and recognised in accordance with IFRS 9.

We also performed sensitivity analysis on the staging criteria and noted that substantial changes would be needed to the criteria to result in a material difference;  and\n- \uf02d For individually assessed impairments, in a few instances we identified judgmental differences in respect of the extent of the impairment identified, however, none of these differences, individually or in aggregate, were considered material.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Credit Risk section of the Risk and capital management section Accounting policies\n\nNote 15 to the financial statements\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n290\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nR Riisskk\n\n## O Ouurr  rreessppoonnssee  ttoo  tthhee  rriisskk\n\n## Provisions for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group has reported \u00a31.1 billion (2021 - \u00a31.3 billion) of provisions for liabilities and charges, including \u00a30.7 billion (2021 - \u00a30.8 billion) for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters as detailed in Note 21 of the financial statements.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny and the continued litigious environment give rise to a high level of management judgment in determining appropriate provisions and disclosures for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. Management judgment is needed to determine whether a present obligation exists and a provision should be recorded at 31 December 2022 in accordance with the accounting criteria set out under IAS 37.\n\n## The most significant areas of judgment are:\n\n- \uf02d Judgment and risk of management bias - Auditing the adequacy of these provisions is complex because judgment is involved in the selection and use of assumptions in the estimation of specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. There is also a risk of management bias in the determination of whether an outflow in respect of identified material customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters is probable and can be estimated reliably; and\n- \uf02d Disclosure - Judgment is required to assess the adequacy of disclosures of provisions and contingent liabilities given the underlying estimation uncertainty in the provisions, and other uncertainties and assumptions.\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the identification, estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions and other uncertainties and assumptions related to customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters considering the potential for management override of controls. The controls tested, among others, included those to identify and monitor claims, determine when a provision is required and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate provisions.\n\nExamination of regulatory correspondence: We examined the relevant regulatory and legal correspondence to assess developments in certain cases.  We also considered regulatory developments to identify actual or possible non-compliance with laws and regulations that might have a material effect on the financial statements.  For cases which were settled during the period, we compared the actual outflows with the provision that had been recorded, considered whether further risk existed, and evaluated the level of disclosures provided.\n\nInquiry of legal counsel: For significant legal matters, we received confirmations from the Group's external legal counsel to evaluate the likelihood of the obligation and management's estimate of the outflow at year-end. We also conducted inquiries with internal legal counsel over the existence of the legal obligations and related provision. We performed a test for unrecorded provisions to assess if there were cases not considered in the provision estimate by assessing against external legal confirmations and discussing with internal counsel.\n\nTesting of assumptions: Where appropriate, we involved our conduct risk and forensics specialists to assist us in evaluating the provision for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. We tested the underlying data and assumptions used in the determination of the provisions recorded, including expected claim rates, legal costs, and the timing of settlement. We evaluated the accuracy of management's historical estimates by comparing the actual settlement to the provision and considered peer bank settlement in similar cases. We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used by management by comparing to the results of our independently performed benchmarking and sensitivity analysis. We also developed our own range of reasonable alternative estimates and compared them to management's provision. We tested utilisations of remaining provisions during the year and assessed the sufficiency of the remaining provisions yet to be paid for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters.\n\nDisclosure: We evaluated the disclosures provided on customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters to assess whether they complied with accounting standards.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that provisions for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters are reasonable and recognised in accordance with IFRS. We concurred with the recognition, measurement and level of disclosures of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. We did not identify any material unrecorded provisions. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d The level of provisions by their nature incorporates significant judgments to be made and may change as a result of future developments; and\n- \uf02d Continued vigilance in assessing conduct risks from the impact of cost of living crisis and Consumer Duty Act, which may not manifest until after the current economic conditions take effect or implementation deadline, respectively.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Accounting policies Note 21 and 26 to the financial statements\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n291",

The fair value of these instruments can involve complex valuation models and significant fair value adjustments, both of which may be reliant on inputs where there is limited market observability.\n\nManagement's estimates which required significant judgment include:\n\n- \uf02d Complex models - Complex model-dependent valuations of financial instruments, which include interest rate swaps linked to prepayment behaviour and interest rate and foreign exchange options with exotic features;\n- \uf02d Illiquid inputs - Pricing inputs and calibrations for illiquid instruments, including fair value loan exposures for which there is no active market. Additionally, derivative instruments whose valuation is dependent on discount rates associated with complex collateral arrangements;\n- \uf02d Fair value adjustments - The appropriateness and completeness of fair value adjustments made to derivatives valuations including Funding Valuation Adjustments (FVA), Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA), relating to derivative counterparties whose credit spread may not be observable and material product and deal specific adjustments on long dated derivative portfolios; and\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to financial instrument valuation and related income statement measurement including independent price verification, valuation models governance, collateral management, income statement analysis, and the associated controls over relevant information technology systems. We also observed the Valuation Committees where valuation inputs, assumptions and adjustments were discussed and approved.\n\nWe involved our financial instrument valuation and modelling specialists to assist us in performing procedures including the following:\n\n- \uf02d Complex models: Testing complex model-dependent valuations by performing independent revaluation to assess the appropriateness of models and the adequacy of assumptions and inputs used by the Group;\n- \uf02d Illiquid inputs: Independently re-pricing instruments that had been valued using illiquid pricing inputs, using alternative pricing sources where available, to evaluate management's valuation;\n- \uf02d Fair value adjustments: Comparing fair value adjustment methodologies to current market practice and assessing the appropriateness and adequacy of the valuation adjustment framework in light of emerging market practice and changes in the risk profile of the underlying portfolio; and revaluing a sample of counterparty level FVA and CVA, comparing funding spreads to third party data, independently challenging illiquid CVA inputs, and testing material product and deal specific adjustments on the long-dated derivatives portfolio.\n\nThroughout our audit procedures we considered the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook, including market volatility and the impact of climate change on the valuation of financial instruments, particularly in relation to long-dated illiquid positions.\n\nIn addition, we assessed whether there were any indicators of aggregate bias in financial instrument marking and methodology assumptions.\n\nWe performed back-testing analysis of recent trade activity and asset disposals to evaluate the drivers of significant differences between book value and trade value and to assess the impact on the fair value of similar instruments within the portfolio. We performed an analysis of significant collateral discrepancies with counterparties to assess the potential impact on the fair value of the underlying (and similar) financial instruments.\n\n- \uf02d The manipulation of revenue recognition is most likely to arise through the inappropriate valuation of these instruments given the level of judgment involved.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that the assumptions used by management to reflect the fair value of financial instruments with higher risk characteristics and the recognition of related income is reasonable and in accordance with IFRS. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d Complex model-dependent valuations were appropriate based on the output of our independent revaluations, analysis of trade activity, assessment of the output of the independent price verification process, inspection of collateral disagreements and peer benchmarking;\n- \uf02d The fair value estimates of hard-to-price financial instruments appropriately reflected pricing information available at 31 December 2022; and\n- \uf02d Valuation adjustments applied to derivative portfolios for credit, funding and other risks were recorded in accordance with the requirements of IFRS considering trade activity for positions with common risk characteristics, analysis of market data and peer benchmarking.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Accounting policies\n\nNote 11 to the financial statements\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n292\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nR Riisskk\n\n## O Ouurr  rreessppoonnssee  ttoo  tthhee  rriisskk\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets, impairment of goodwill and, in the Parent Company's accounts, investments in group undertakings.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had reported goodwill of \u00a35.5 billion (2021: \u00a35.5 billion) and deferred tax assets of \u00a32.0 billion (2021: \u00a30.8 billion). The parent company has reported investments in group undertakings of \u00a352.8 billion (2021: \u00a348.8 billion).\n\nThe recognition and carrying value of goodwill, deferred tax and, in the Parent Company's accounts, investments in group undertakings are based on estimates of future profitability, which require significant management judgment and include the risk of management bias. The recognition of deferred tax also considers the future profit forecasts of the legal entities as well as interpretation of recent changes to tax rates and laws.\n\nThe judgments and assumptions used are especially complex and subjective due to their forward-looking nature and inherent uncertainties. These include:\n\n- \uf02d Revenue forecasts which are inherently challenging due to the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook including the impacts of climate change which are driven by delivery of the Group's Strategy;\n- \uf02d Cost forecasts given the strategic ambitions of the bank and potential headwinds from inflation and supply chain issues;\n- \uf02d Macroeconomic and model assumptions used in the forecasting and valuation assessments (discount rates, growth rates, macroeconomic assumptions) including the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook and the impact of climate change over an extended period; and\n- \uf02d Disclosure adequacy including key assumptions, the sensitivity of changes to these assumptions as well as an explanation of the impairment testing performed.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n293\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the preparation and review of the forecasts, and the significant assumptions (such as discount rate and long-term growth rate) inputs, calculations, methodologies and judgments used in the value-in-use model. This included testing controls over the selection of macroeconomic assumptions in addition to controls over the preparation and review of the revenue and cost projections. In evaluating the governance processes we reviewed the Board meeting materials and minutes where forecasts were discussed and approved, and we observed the committee meetings where the value-in-use model and outcomes were discussed and approved.\n\nMacroeconomic and model assumptions: With the support of our internal economic specialists, we tested whether macroeconomic assumptions used in the Group's forecasts were reasonable by comparing these to other scenarios from a variety of external sources.  We evaluated how the discount rates and long-term growth rates used by management compared to our ranges which were developed using peer practice, external market data and calculations performed by our valuation specialists. We also assessed changes to valuation methodology and benchmarked this against industry practice with the assistance of our valuation specialists.\n\nRevenue forecasts: We evaluated the underlying business strategies, comparing to expected market trends and considering anticipated balance sheet growth. We obtained an understanding of the Group's strategy including their consideration of the impact of climate change and considered its expected impact on the forecasts and the extent to which decisions had been factored into the forecasts, where appropriate, in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. We also inspected the findings from the review performed by management including their own sensitivity analysis of the forecasts.\n\nCost forecasts: We tested how previous management forecasts, including the impact of cost reduction programmes, compared to actual results to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting process. We also tested the reasonableness of key performance indicators against peers with the help of our valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the Group's cost forecast.\n\nDeferred Tax Model: With the support of our taxation specialists, we reviewed the deferred tax model including an assessment of the time horizon used for the recoverability of losses and other temporary differences.\n\nSensitivity analysis: We evaluated how management considered alternative assumptions and performed our own sensitivity and scenario analyses on certain assumptions such as cost and revenue forecasts, discount rate, long-term growth rate and other key performance indicators on both the detailed forecasts and on an overall basis.\n\nDisclosure: We evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements including the appropriateness of assumptions and sensitivities disclosed. We tested the data and calculations included in the disclosures.",

At 31 December 2022, the Group reported a net pension asset of \u00a3220 million (2021 - \u00a3488 million) comprising \u00a3318 million of schemes in surplus and \u00a398 million of schemes in deficit (2021 - \u00a3602 million and \u00a3114 million respectively). The net pension asset is sensitive to changes in the key judgments and estimates, including the effects of current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook, including market volatility, which include:\n\n- \uf02d Assumptions Actuarial assumptions and inputs including discount rate, inflation, pension payment and longevity to determine the valuation of retirement benefit liabilities;\n- \uf02d Valuations Pricing inputs and calibrations for illiquid or complex model-dependent valuations of certain investments held by the schemes; and\n- \uf02d Funding - the pension schemes have adequate liquidity to cover for any shortfall in derivative asset prices as a result of current economic conditions.\n- \uf02d Augmentation cap Quantification of trustee's rights to unilaterally augment benefits (Augmentation cap) to determine the recognition of surplus.\n\nControls testing We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the actuarial assumptions setting process, the data inputs used in the actuarial calculation and the measurement of the fair value of the schemes' assets.\n\nAssumptions We involved our actuarial specialists to evaluate the actuarial assumptions by comparing them to independently obtained third party sources and market practice. We assessed the impact on pension liabilities due to changes in financial, demographic and longevity assumptions over the year, and whether these were supported by objective external evidence and rationales, including the effects of current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook, including market volatility.\n\nValuations - We tested the fair value of scheme assets by independently calculating fair value for a sample of the assets held. Our sample included cash, equity and debt instruments, derivative financial instruments and illiquid assets. We involved our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of management's valuation methodology including the judgments made in determining significant assumptions used in the valuation of complex and illiquid pension assets, including the effects of current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook, including market volatility. We independently re-priced illiquid and complex assets that had been valued using unobservable market inputs, using alternative pricing sources where available, to evaluate management's valuations.\n\nFunding - in the performance of our procedures we consider whether the pension schemes have adequate funding to cover for any shortfall in derivative asset prices.\n\nAugmentation cap and equalisation adjustments - We involved our actuarial specialists to test the estimation of the augmentation cap including the inputs used in the calculation. We also assessed the methodology and judgments made in calculating these estimates and the associated accounting treatment in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14.\n\nDisclosure We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements, including the appropriateness of the assumptions, sensitivities and disclosures over investment strategy and risk management..\n\n294\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that the valuation and disclosure of the net pension balance are reasonable and in accordance with IFRS.

Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that applications process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate manner. This risk is also impacted by the greater dependency on third parties, increasing use of cloud platforms, decommissioning of legacy systems, and migration to new systems.  Such controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data.\n\nThe Group has implemented user access management controls across IT applications, databases and operating systems. We have identified user access-related deficiencies in the past and whilst the number of deficiencies has reduced year over year, the risk of inappropriate access remains.\n\nWe evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls over the applications, operating systems and databases that are relevant to financial reporting.\n\n## Controls testing\n\nWe tested user access by assessing the controls in place for in-scope applications, in particular testing the addition and periodic recertification of users' access. We continue to focus on key controls enforced by the Group's user access management tools, including the completeness of user data, automated identification of movers and leavers and the adequacy of the overall control environment.\n\nDuring the current audit period, the Identity and Access Management tool used in NatWest Markets was decommissioned and replaced with the Group's strategic tool. We tested the governance process around the migration and onboarding of users to the Identity and Access Management tool and noted no deficiencies, with the suite of access management controls supported by the two tools remaining consistent throughout the year.\n\nA number of systems are outsourced to third party service providers. For these systems, we tested IT general controls through evaluating the relevant Service Organisation Controls ('SOC') reports (where available). This included assessing the timing of the reporting, the controls tested by the service auditor and whether they address relevant IT risks. We also tested required complementary user entity controls performed by management. Where a SOC report was not available we identified and reviewed compensating business controls to address risks to financial reporting. Several systems have been migrated to a cloud-hosted infrastructure model, however access management processes and controls remained in-house and they formed part of our testing.\n\nWhere control deficiencies were identified, we tested remediation activities performed by management and compensating controls in place and assessed what additional testing procedures were necessary to mitigate any residual risk. We also performed a further analysis of access management deficiencies identified by EY, Management and Internal Audit to revalidate our overall approach to access management testing.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that IT controls impacting financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. The following matters were reported to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d We have seen an overall reduction in the number of discrete IT control deficiencies identified compared to prior year.\n- \uf02d Improvements were made to further standardise access management processes and controls across the Group, which was one of the drivers for the reduced number of deficiencies; and\n- \uf02d Particular attention should continue to be paid to controls over user access management including ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the data used to perform access controls. Where issues were noted in relation to access management, these were remediated by year end or mitigated by compensating controls. We performed additional testing in response to deficiencies identified, where required;\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n295",

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a3208 million (2021: \u00a3157 million), which is 5% (2021: 5%) of the profit before tax of the Group of \u00a35,132 million (2021: \u00a34,032million) adjusted for non-recurring conduct and litigation costs. We believe removing these non-recurring charges reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements and is consistent with the prior year. The 5% basis used for Group materiality is consistent with the wider industry, and is the standard for listed and regulated entities.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3208 million (2021 - \u00a3157 million) which is 0.4% (2021 - 0.3%) of equity of the Parent Company. We believe this reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements as the Parent Company's primary purpose is to act as a holding company with investments in the Group's subsidiaries, not to generate operating profits and therefore a profit based measure is not relevant.\n\n## P Peerrffoorrmmaannccee  mmaatteerriiaalliittyy\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgment was that performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a3156 million (2021: \u00a3118 million). We have based the percentage of performance materiality on a number of considerations, including the number and amount of identified misstatements, the effectiveness of the control environment and other factors affecting the entity and its financial reporting. Audit work at component teams for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a347 million to \u00a3136 million (2021: \u00a335 million to \u00a3106 million).\n\n## R Reeppoorrttiinngg  tthhrreesshhoolldd\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a310 million (2021 - \u00a38 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## O Otthheerr  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Accounts, including the Strategic Report, Financial Review, Corporate Governance, Report of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, Report of the Group Audit Committee, Report of the Group Board Risk Committee, Report of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee, Report of the Technology and Innovation Committee, Report of the directors,  Risk and capital management, Non-IFRS financial measures, Risk factors, Material contracts, and Additional information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined below, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \uf02d We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are the regulations, licence conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA); Companies Act 2006; and the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX).\n- \uf02d Conducted a review of correspondence with and reports from the regulators, including the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA').\n- \uf02d We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making inquiries of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance matters.

We also tested controls and performed procedures to respond to the fraud risks as identified in our key audit matters.

We also identified the risks of fraud in our key audit matters as described above and identified areas that we considered when performing our fraud procedures, such as cybersecurity, segregation of duties testing, user access testing and the appropriateness of sources used when performing confirmation testing on accounts such as cash, loans and securities. Our procedures over our key audit matters and other significant accounting estimates included challenging management on the assumptions and judgements made in determining these estimates.\n- \uf02d Identified and tested journal entries, including those posted with certain descriptions or unusual characteristics, backdated journals or posted by infrequent and unexpected users.\n- \uf02d The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, involving specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Further information is provided where judgment and estimation is applied to critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nFuture accounting developments details new, or amendments to existing, accounting standards, when they are effective from and where we are assessing their impact on future financial statements.\n\n## 1 1..  PPrreesseennttaattiioonn  ooff  ffiinnaanncciiaall  ssttaatteemmeennttss\n\nNatWest Group plc is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland. The financial statements are presented in the functional currency, pounds sterling.\n\nThe audited financial statements include audited sections of the Risk and capital management section. The directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis after assessing the principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence over the twelve months from the date the financial statements are approved (see the Report of the directors) and in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS), and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The critical and significant accounting policies and related judgments are set out below.\n\nThe financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are stated at fair value.\n\nThe effect of the amendments to IFRS effective from 1 January 2022 on our financial statements was immaterial.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of NatWest Group plc and the entities it controls. Control arises when we have the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return from the entity. Control is assessed by reference to our ability to enforce our will on the other entity, typically through voting rights. The consolidated financial statements are prepared under consistent accounting policies.\n\nOn acquisition of a subsidiary, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at their fair value. A subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date it is controlled by us until the date we cease to control it through a sale or a significant change in circumstances. Changes in our interest in a subsidiary that does not result in us ceasing to control that subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\nWe apply accounting for associates and joint arrangements (including joint ventures) to entities where we have significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies.  We assess significant influence by reference to a presumption of voting rights of more than 20%, but less than 50%, supplemented by a qualitative assessment of substantive rights which include representation at the Board of Directors, significant exchange of managerial personnel or technology amongst others. Joint ventures are arrangements where we have joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are recorded upon initial recognition at cost, increased or decreased each period by the share of the subsequent levels of profit or loss, and other changes in equity are considered in line with their nature.\n\nTransactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements to show only those transactions and balances external to us.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n306\n\nThe judgments and assumptions involved in our accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are noted below. The use of estimates, assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by us would affect our reported results.\n\n## How Climate risk affects our accounting judgments and estimates\n\n## Business planning\n\nKey financial estimates are based on management's latest fiveyear revenue and cost forecasts. The outputs from this forecast affect forward-looking accounting estimates. Measurement of deferred tax and expected credit losses are highly sensitive to reasonably possible changes in those anticipated conditions. In 2022, our scenario planning supported the development of NatWest Group's initial iteration climate transition plan, including the assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n- \uf02d The initial iteration of our Climate transition plan includes an assessment of:\n- \uf02d changes in business operations, products and services to support customer decarbonisation;\n- \uf02d financial plans linked to business operations and strategy. During 2022, the financial planning process has been enhanced to incorporate climate related opportunities included in the climate transition plan.

We also assume certain broader policy responses and technological innovation to enable the wider transition of the economy.\n- \uf02d There remains considerable uncertainty regarding this policy response, including the effect of wider geo-political uncertainty on governmental ambitions regarding climate transition and the effect of decarbonisation on wider economic growth, technology development and customer behaviours.\n\n## Information used in other accounting estimates\n\nWe make use of reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgments and estimates. This includes information about the observable effects of the physical and transition risks of climate change on the current creditworthiness of borrowers, asset values and market indicators. It also includes the effect on our competitiveness and profitability. Many of the effects arising from climate change will be longer term in nature, with an inherent level of uncertainty, and have limited effect on accounting judgments and estimates for the current period. Some physical and transition risks can manifest in the shorter term. The following items represent the most significant effects:\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Accounting policies continued\n\n- \uf02d The classification of financial instruments linked to climate, or other sustainability indicators: consideration is given to whether the effect of climate related terms prevent the instrument cashflows being solely payments of principal and interest.\n- \uf02d The measurement of expected credit loss considers the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. Future cashflows are discounted, so long dated cashflows are less likely to affect current expectations on credit loss. Our assessment of sector specific risks, and whether additional adjustments are required, include expectations of the ability of those sectors to meet their financing needs in the market. Changes in credit stewardship and credit risk appetite that stem from climate considerations, such as oil and gas, will directly affect our positions.\n- \uf02d The use of market indicators as inputs to fair value is assumed to include current information and knowledge regarding the effect of climate risk.\n\n## Effect of climate change in the estimation of expected credit loss\n\nSince the implementation of IFRS 9 in January 2018 loan losses reflect expected credit losses taking account of relevant and reliable forward looking information. We are evaluating the effect of the physical and transition consequences of climate change on our experience of loan loss. We use available information regarding the effect of climate transition policy largely driven by carbon prices as an adjustment to macroeconomic factors that are used as inputs to the models that generate PD and LGD outcomes, which are key inputs to the ECL calculation. The determination of whether specific loss drivers and climate events generate specific losses is ongoing and is necessary to determine how sensitive changes in ECL could be to climate inputs. As at 31 December 2022, our quantification of the impact due to physical risk and how other climate risks may impact the ECL is ongoing.\n\nAn impact assessment on how climate risk factors may require adjustment in our IFRS 9 model suite has also not been finalised. We judged that this information was not sufficiently complete to make a reliable estimate and given the immaterial change in ECL it indicated, determined it was not appropriate to adjust ECL.\n\nWhen this information is reliable, possibly during 2023, it could be used in our ECL calculation. A key part of this is determining that any adjustment resulting from the inclusion of new climaterelated inputs does not double count or omit credit losses arising from other inputs. We will continue to develop our data, models and methodologies relating to climate evaluation and market practice will continue to evolve and this will affect the estimation of climate effect in ECL on an ongoing basis. We expect that the effect of climate risks on ECL will increase as government policy, organisations and individuals react to changes in climate as well as the probable increased occurrence of climate-related loss events (such as flooding and wildfire).\n\n## 2 2..

DDeeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and the carrying amount for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent their recovery is probable.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences that arise from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction (other than a business combination) that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates expected to apply in the periods when the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where we have a legally enforceable right to offset and where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority either on an individual NatWest Group company or on NatWest Group companies in the same tax group that intend, in future periods, to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or on a gross basis simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax asset recoverability is based on the level of supporting offsetable deferred tax liabilities we have and of our future taxable profits. These future taxable profits are based on our five-year revenue and cost forecasts and the expectation of long term economic growth beyond this period. The five-year forecast takes account of management's current expectations on competitiveness and profitability. The long term growth rate reflects external indicators which will include market expectations on climate risk. We do not consider any additional adjustments to this indicator.\n\n## 2 2..22..

All derivatives are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement considers the characteristics of the asset or liability and the assumptions that a market participant would consider when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nWe manage some portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities based on our net exposure to either market or credit risk. In these cases, the fair value is derived from the net risk exposure of that portfolio with portfolio level adjustments applied to incorporate bid-offer spreads, counterparty credit risk, and funding costs (see 'Valuation Adjustments').\n\nWhere the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques involve a degree of estimation, the extent of which depends on the instrument's complexity and the availability of market-based data. The complexity and uncertainty in the financial instrument's fair value is categorised using the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe use of market indicators as inputs to fair value is assumed to include current information and knowledge regarding the effect of climate risk.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n308\n\n## 2 2..33..

Any change in impairment is reported in the income statement.\n\nLoss allowances are forward-looking, based on 12-month ECL where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk rating, otherwise allowances are based on lifetime expected losses.\n\nECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. The probability is determined by the risk of default which is applied to the cash flow estimates. In the absence of a change in credit rating, allowances are recognised when there is a reduction in the net present value of expected cash flows. Following a significant increase in credit risk, ECL are adjusted from 12 months to lifetime. This will lead to a higher impairment charge.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit loss considers the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. Future cashflows are discounted, so long-dated cashflows are less likely to affect current expectations on credit loss. Our assessment of sector specific risks, and whether additional adjustments are required, include expectations of the ability of those sectors to meet their financing needs in the market. Changes in credit stewardship and credit risk appetite that stem from climate considerations, such as oil and gas, will directly affect our positions.\n\nJudgment is exercised as follows:\n\n- \uf02d Models -in certain low default portfolios, Basel parameter estimates are also applied for IFRS 9.\n- \uf02d Non-modelled portfolios - use a standardised capital requirement under Basel II. Under IFRS 9, they have bespoke treatments for the identification of significant increase in credit risk. Benchmark PDs, EADs and LGDs are reviewed annually for appropriateness. The ECL calculation is based on expected future cash flows, which is typically applied at a portfolio level.\n- \uf02d Multiple economic scenarios (MES) - the central, or base, scenario is most critical to the ECL calculation, independent of the method used to generate a range of alternative outcomes and their probabilities.\n- \uf02d Significant increase in credit risk - IFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the current probability of default over the remaining lifetime) with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nOn restructuring where a financial asset is not derecognised, the revised cash flows are used in re-estimating the credit loss. Where restructuring causes derecognition of the original financial asset, the fair value of the replacement asset is used as the closing cash flow of the original asset.\n\nWhere in the course of the orderly realisation of a loan, it is exchanged for equity shares or property, the exchange is accounted for as the sale of the loan and the acquisition of equity securities or investment property. Where our acquired interest is in equity shares, relevant policies for control, associates and joint ventures apply.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Accounting policies continued\n\nImpaired financial assets are written off and therefore derecognised from the balance sheet when we conclude that there is no longer any realistic prospect of recovery of part, or all, of the loan. For financial assets that are individually assessed for impairment, the timing of the write-off is determined on a case-by-case basis. Such financial assets are reviewed regularly and write-off will be prompted by bankruptcy, insolvency, re-negotiation, and similar events.\n\nThe typical time frames from initial impairment to write-off for our collectively assessed portfolios are:\n\n- \uf02d Retail mortgages: write-off usually occurs within five years, or earlier, when an account is closed, but can be longer where the customer engages constructively;\n- \uf02d Credit cards: the irrecoverable amount is typically written off after twelve arrears cycles or at four years post default any remaining amounts outstanding are written off;\n- \uf02d Overdrafts and other unsecured loans: write-off occurs within six years;\n- \uf02d Commercial loans: write-offs are determined in the light of individual circumstances; and Business loans are generally written off within five years.\n\n## 2 2..44..

An obligation exists when we have a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and have raised a valid expectation in those affected either by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features.\n\nWe recognise any onerous cost of the present obligation under a contract as a provision. An onerous cost is the unavoidable cost of meeting our contractual obligations that exceed the expected economic benefits. When we intend to vacate a leasehold property or right of use asset, the asset would be tested for impairment and a provision may be recognised for the ancillary contractual occupancy costs.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because either an outflow of economic benefits is not probable, or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but information about them is disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow of economic benefits in settlement is remote.\n\n## 3 3..

The fair value of shares granted is the market price adjusted for the expected effect of dividends as employees are not entitled to dividends until shares are vested.\n\nThe fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. These consider the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors such as the dividend yield.",

If any such indication exists, we estimate the recoverable amount of the asset and compares it to its balance sheet value to calculate if an impairment loss should be charged to the income statement. The balance sheet value of the asset is reduced by the amount of the impairment loss. A reversal of an impairment loss on intangible assets or property, plant and equipment is recognised in the income statement provided the increased carrying value is not greater than it would have been had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.

A business model assessment helps to ascertain the measurement approach depending on whether cash flows result from holding financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows, from selling those financial assets, or both.\n\nBusiness model assessment of assets is made at portfolio level, being the level at which they are managed to achieve a predefined business objective. This is expected to result in the most consistent classification of assets because it aligns with the stated objectives for the portfolio, its risk management, manager's remuneration and the ability to monitor sales of assets from a portfolio. When a significant change to our business is communicated to external parties, we reassess our business model for managing those financial assets. We reclassify financial assets if we have a significant change to the business model. A reclassification is applied prospectively from the reclassification date.\n\nThe contractual terms of a financial asset; any leverage features; prepayment and extension terms; and discounts or penalties to interest rates that are part of meeting environmental, social and governance targets as well as other contingent and leverage features, non-recourse arrangements and features that could modify the timing and/or amount of the contractual cash flows that might reset the effective rate of interest; are considered in determining whether cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nCertain financial assets may be designated at fair value through profit or loss (DFV) upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates, or significantly reduces, accounting mismatch.\n\nEquity shares are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless specifically elected as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nUpon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in fair value through other comprehensive income reserve are recycled to the income statement for monetary assets and for nonmonetary assets (equity shares) the cumulative gains or losses are transferred directly to retained earnings.",

Conversely, an asset is not derecognised in a contract under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nA financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation is paid, or is cancelled, or expires. Cancellation includes the issuance of a substitute instrument on substantially different terms.\n\n## 3 3..1100..

Incremental costs and related tax that are directly attributable to an equity transaction are deducted from equity.\n\nThe consideration for any ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc purchased by us (known as treasury shares or own shares held) is deducted from equity. On the cancellation of treasury shares their nominal value is removed from equity and any excess of consideration over nominal value is treated in accordance with the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nOn the sale or re-issue of treasury shares the consideration received and related tax are credited to equity, net of any directly attributable incremental costs.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n312\n\n## 3 3..1122..

We use derivatives as part of our trading activities, to manage our own risk such as interest rate, foreign exchange, or credit risk or in certain customer transactions. Not all derivatives used to manage risk are in hedge accounting relationships (an IFRS method to reduce accounting mismatch from changes in the fair value of the derivatives reported in the income statement).\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not in hedge relationships are recognised in the income statement in Income from trading activities except for gains and losses on those derivatives that are managed together with financial instruments designated at fair value; these gains and losses are included in Other operating income.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe enter into three types of hedge accounting relationships (see later). Hedge accounting relationships are designated and documented at inception in line with the requirements of IAS 39 Financial instruments - Recognition and Measurement.\n\nThe documentation identifies the hedged item, the hedging instrument and details of the risk that is being hedged and the way in which effectiveness will be assessed at inception and during the period of the hedge. When designating a hedging relationship, we consider: the economic relationship between the hedged item (including the risk being hedged) and the hedging instrument; the nature of the risk; the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge; and the appropriateness of the method that will be used to assess hedge effectiveness. Designated hedging relationships must be expected to be highly effective both on a prospective and retrospective basis. Effectiveness is assessed by reference to the degree of offsetting between the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk and the changes in fair value of the designated hedging derivatives.\n\nFair value hedge - the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in the income statement. Where the hedged item is measured at amortised cost, the balance sheet amount of the hedged item is also adjusted.\n\nCash flow hedge - the effective portion of the designated hedge relationship is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in the income statement. When the hedged item (forecasted cash flows) results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged forecasted cash flows affect the income statement.\n\nHedge of net investment in a foreign operation -in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of the designated hedge relationship is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Non-derivative financial liabilities as well as derivatives may be designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.\n\n## Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting i.e. the hedge is not highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the documented risk management strategy; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or if hedge designation is revoked.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Accounting policies continued\n\nFor fair value hedging any cumulative adjustment is amortised to the income statement over the life of the hedged item. Where the hedge item is no longer on the balance sheet the adjustment to the hedged item is reported in the income statement. For cash flow hedging the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement when the hedged cash flows occur or, if the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, when the hedged forecast cash flows affect the income statement. Where a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement immediately.\n\nFor net investment hedging on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n313\n\n## 4 4..

Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the financial instrument's yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instrument are considered when estimating future cash flows. Negative interest on financial assets is presented in interest payable and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented in interest receivable.\n\nIncluded in interest receivable is finance lease income of \u00a3314 million (2021 - \u00a3298 million; 2020 - \u00a3289 million) which is recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 3.1.\n\n| Continuing operations                                         | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 (1) \u00a3m   | 2020 (1) \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| Balances at central banks and loans to banks -

When estimating the fair value of the award, the number of shares granted, and the prevailing market price as defined on page 149 are used.  The fair value of the award is recognised as services are provided over the vesting period.\n\n| Sharesave      | 2022                     | 2022                          | 2021                     | 2021                          | 2020                     | 2020                          |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) |\n| At 1 January   | 1.61                     | 95                            | 1.64                     | 96                            | 2.01                     | 84                            |\n| Granted        | 1.86                     | 25                            | 1.80                     | 24                            | 1.12                     | 35                            |\n| Exercised      | 1.88                     | (15)                          | 1.76                     | (10)                          | 1.83                     | -                             |\n| Cancelled      | 1.60                     | (6)                           | 2.02                     | (15)                          | 2.20                     | (23)                          |\n| At 31 December | 1.63                     | 99                            | 1.61                     | 95                            | 1.64                     | 96                            |\n\nOptions are exercisable within six months of vesting; 5.1 million options were exercisable at 31 December 2022 (2021 - 6.0 million; 2020 - 6.3 million).

The presentation is consistent with internal financial reporting and how senior management assesses the performance of each operating segment.\n\n## C Chhaannggeess  iinn  rreeppoorrttaabbllee  sseeggmmeennttss::\n\nTwo changes to reportable segments have been made:\n\nOn 27 January 2022, NatWest Group announced that a new business segment, Commercial & Institutional, would be created, bringing together the Commercial, NatWest Markets and RBSI businesses to form a single business segment, with common management and objectives, to best support our customers across the full non-personal customer lifecycle.\n\nFollowing good progress with respect to the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland, announced in February 2021,Ulster Bank RoI continuing operations are now included in Central items & other.\n\nComparatives have been re-presented. The re-presentation of operating segments does not change the consolidated financial results of NatWest Group.\n\n## R Reeppoorrttaabbllee  ooppeerraattiinngg  sseeggmmeennttss::\n\nThe business is organised into the following reportable segments: Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial & Institutional, and Central items & other.\n\nRetail Banking serves personal customers in the UK and includes Ulster Bank customers in Northern Ireland.\n\nPrivate Banking serves UK connected high-net-worth individuals and their business interests.\n\nCommercial & Institutional brings together our Commercial Banking, NatWest Markets and RBS International businesses, to support our customers across the full non-personal customer lifecycle, both domestically and internationally. Our Markets offering helps our customers manage financial risks across different geographies, while our International offering provides full-service banking operations in the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar and Luxembourg.\n\nCentral items & other includes corporate functions, such as NatWest Group Treasury, finance, risk management, compliance, legal, communications and human resources. Central functions manages NatWest Group capital resources and NatWest Groupwide regulatory projects and provides services to the reportable segments. Balances in relation to litigation issues and the international private banking business are included in Central items in the relevant periods. Ulster Bank RoI is no longer an operating segment and its continuing operations now form part of Central items & other.\n\n## Allocation of central balance sheet items\n\nNatWest Group allocates all central costs relating to Services and Functions to the business using appropriate drivers; these are reported as indirect costs in the segmental income statements. Assets and risk-weighted assets held centrally, mainly relating to NatWest Group Treasury, are allocated to the business using appropriate drivers .\n\n| 2022                          | Retail Banking \u00a3m   | Private Banking \u00a3m   | Commercial & Institutional \u00a3m   | Central items & other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Continuing operations         |                     |                      |                                 |                            |            |\n| Net interest income           | 5,224               | 777                  | 4,171                           | (330)                      | 9,842      |\n| Net fees and commissions      | 422                 | 250                  | 1,580                           | 40                         | 2,292      |\n| Other non-interest income     | -                   | 29                   | 662                             | 331                        | 1,022      |\n| Total income                  | 5,646               | 1,056                | 6,413                           | 41                         | 13,156     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | -                   | -                    | (161)                           | (672)                      | (833)      |\n| Other operating expenses      | (2,593)             | (622)                | (3,583)                         | (56)                       | (6,854)    |\n| Impairment (losses)/releases  | (229)               | 2                    | (122)                           | 12                         | (337)      |\n| Operating profit/(loss)       | 2,824               | 436                  | 2,547                           | (675)                      | 5,132      |\n\n2021\n\n(1)\n\n| Continuing operations Net interest income   | 4,074   | 480   | 2,974   | 7     | 7,535   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Net fees and commissions                    | 377     | 258   | 1,440   | 45    | 2,120   |\n| Other non-interest income                   | (6)     | 78    | 424     | 278   | 774     |\n| Total income                                | 4,445   | 816   | 4,838   | 330   | 10,429  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation               | (85)    | -     | (173)   | (665) | (923)   |\n| Other operating expenses                    | (2,428) | (520) | (3,584) | (303) | (6,835) |\n| Impairment releases/(losses)                | 36      | 54    | 1,160   | (77)  | 1,173   |\n| Operating profit/(loss)                     | 1,968   | 350   | 2,241   | (715) | 3,844   |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n319",

The defined contribution schemes invest contributions in a choice of funds and the accumulated contributions and investment returns are used by the employee to provide benefits on retirement, there is no legal or constructive obligation for NatWest Group to pay any further contributions or benefits. The defined benefit schemes provide pensions in retirement based on employees' pensionable salary and service.\n\nNatWest Group's balance sheet includes any defined benefit pension scheme surplus or deficit as a retirement benefit asset or liability reported in other assets and other liabilities. The surplus or deficit is the difference between the liabilities to be paid from the defined benefit scheme, and the assets held by the scheme to meet these liabilities. The liabilities are calculated by external actuaries using a number of financial and demographic assumptions.\n\nFor some NatWest Group defined benefit schemes where there is a net defined benefit surplus in excess of the present value of any economic benefits that can be obtained from that surplus, the application of accounting standards means we do not recognise that surplus on the balance sheet.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 3.3.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  ccoonnttrriibbuuttiioonn  sscchheemmeess\n\nNatWest Group sponsors several defined contribution schemes in different territories, which new employees are entitled to join. NatWest Group pays specific contributions into individual investment funds on employees' behalf. Once those contributions are paid, there is no further liability on the NatWest Group balance sheet relating to the defined contribution scheme.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  bbeenneeffiitt  sscchheemmeess\n\nNatWest Group sponsors a number of pension schemes in the UK and overseas, including the Main section of the NatWest Group Pension Fund (the Main section) which operates under UK trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of its members in accordance with the terms of the trust deed, the scheme rules and UK legislation.\n\nPension fund trustees are appointed to operate each fund and ensure benefits are paid in accordance with the scheme rules and national law. The trustees are the legal owner of a scheme's assets, and have a duty to act in the best interests of all scheme members.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n323\n\nThe schemes generally provide a pension of one-sixtieth of final pensionable salary for each year of service prior to retirement up to a maximum of 40 years and are contributory for current members. These have been closed to new entrants for over ten years, although active members continue to build up additional pension benefits, currently subject to 2% maximum annual salary inflation, while they remain employed by NatWest Group. The Main section corporate trustee is NatWest Pension Trustee Limited (the Trustee), a wholly owned subsidiary of NWB Plc, Principal Employer of the Main section. The Board of the Trustee comprises four member trustee directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and pensioner members who apply and six appointed by NatWest Group. Under UK legislation, a defined benefit pension scheme is required to meet the statutory funding objective of having sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its liabilities (the pensions that have been promised to members).\n\nSimilar governance principles apply to NatWest Group's other defined benefit pension schemes.\n\n## I Innvveessttmmeenntt  ssttrraatteeggyy\n\nThe assets of the Main section, which is typical of other group schemes, represent 91% of all plan assets at 31 December 2022 (2021 - 90%) and are invested as shown below.\n\nThe Main section employs physical, derivative and nonderivative instruments to achieve a desired asset class exposure and to reduce the section's interest rate, inflation, and currency risk. This means that the net funding position is considerably less sensitive to changes in market conditions than the value of the assets or liabilities in isolation. In particular, movements in interest rate and inflation are substantially hedged by the Trustee.\n\nOver the year, increases in bond yields resulted in many pension schemes in the UK having to raise additional collateral to support Liability-driven investments positions held as part of their hedging strategies. Liability-driven investments (LDI) refer to assets that are expected to move broadly in line with liabilities on a specific basis. All of the Group's schemes affected by this were able to raise the collateral needed from existing assets, with no additional support from the Group. The Trustee of the Group Pension Fund takes a prudent approach to liquidity and collateral and holds sufficient collateral to withstand substantial rises in gilt yields. The level of collateral held by some of the Group's smaller schemes was increased over the year, so as to ensure they could withstand further large rises in gilt yields if required.",

The trustees and the sponsor, with the support of the Scheme Actuary, agree the assumptions used to value the liabilities and to determine future contribution requirements. The funding assumptions incorporate a margin for prudence over and above the expected cost of providing the benefits promised to members, taking into account the sponsor's covenant and the investment strategy of the scheme. Similar arrangements apply in the other territories where NatWest Group sponsors defined benefit pension schemes.\n\nA full triennial funding valuation of the Main section, effective 31 December 2020, was completed during financial year 2021.\n\nThis triennial funding valuation determined the funding level to be 104%, pension liabilities to be \u00a349 billion and the surplus to be \u00a32 billion, all assessed on the agreed funding basis. The average cost of the future service of current members is 49% of salary before contributions from those members. In addition, the sponsor has agreed to meet administrative expenses. Following the ring-fencing agreement with the Trustee reached in 2018, additional contributions of up to \u00a3500 million p.a. are payable to the Main section should the Group make distributions to shareholders of an equal amount.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n326\n\nThese contributions are capped at \u00a31.5 billion in total; \u00a3500 million was paid in 2022 (2021 - \u00a3500 million). The remaining distribution linked contribution to the Main section would have fallen due in 2023, but NatWest Bank has agreed with the Trustee that assets to the value of the contributions falling due will instead be paid to a new legal structure. These assets will be restricted and are reserved to ensure they are available should they be needed by the Trustee according to agreed criteria in the future. The assets under this arrangement would be available to the Group to the extent that they are not needed under the defined trigger events.\n\nThe key assumptions used to determine the funding liabilities were the discount rate, which is determined based on fixed interest swap and gilt yields plus 0.64% per annum, and mortality assumptions, which result in life expectancies of 27.7/29.4 years for males/females who are currently age 60 and 28.9/30.7 years from age 60 for males/females who are currently aged 40.\n\nThe 2020 triennial valuation of the Group Pension Fund included an allowance for the estimated impact of guaranteed minimum pension equalisation, which is reflected in the IAS 19 valuation at 31 December 2022.\n\n## A Accccoouunnttiinngg  AAssssuummppttiioonnss\n\nPlacing a value on NatWest Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires NatWest Group's management to make a number of assumptions, with the support of independent actuaries. The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations depends upon actual future events and the assumptions made are unlikely to be exactly borne out in practice, meaning the final cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 5 Pensions continued\n\nThe most significant assumptions used for the Main section are shown below:\n\n|                                         | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions (1)   | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions (1)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2022 %                                       | 2021 %                                       |\n| Discount rate                           | 5.0                                          | 1.8                                          |\n| Inflation assumption (RPI)              | 3.2                                          | 3.3                                          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries            | 1.8                                          | 1.8                                          |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions   | 3.2                                          | 3.7                                          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment | 2.5                                          | 2.5                                          |\n| Lump sum conversion rate at retirement  | 18                                           | 18                                           |\n| Longevity at age 60:                    | years                                        | years                                        |\n| Current pensioners                      |                                              |                                              |\n| Males                                   | 27.3                                         | 27.3                                         |\n| Females                                 | 29.1                                         | 29.0                                         |\n| Future pensioners, currently aged 40    |                                              |                                              |\n| Males                                   | 28.3                                         | 28.2                                         |\n| Females                                 | 30.1                                         | 30.1                                         |\n\n## D Diissccoouunntt  rraattee\n\nThe IAS 19 valuation uses a single discount rate set by reference to the yield on a basket of 'high quality' sterling corporate bonds.\n\nSignificant judgment is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the basket of bonds that is used to determine the discount rate used in the IAS 19 valuations. The criteria include issue size, quality of pricing and the exclusion of outliers. Judgment is also required in determining the shape of the yield curve at long durations; a constant credit spread relative to gilts is assumed. Sensitivity to the main assumptions is presented below.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the Main section's defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2022 is 15.3 years (2021 - 20 years).

The Group Audit Committee recognises that for certain assignments, the auditors are best placed to perform the work economically; for other work, NatWest Group selects the supplier best placed to meet its requirements. NatWest Group's auditors are permitted to tender for such work in competition with other firms where the work is permissible under audit independence rules.\n\n|                                                       | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fees payable for:                                     |           |           |           |\n| - the audit of NatWest Group's annual accounts (1)    | 4.7       | 4.4       | 4.7       |\n| - the audit of NatWest Group plc's subsidiaries (1)   | 31.9      | 29.6      | 30.6      |\n| - audit-related assurance services (1,2)              | 3.9       | 5.3       | 4.7       |\n| Total audit and audit-related assurance services fees | 40.5      | 39.3      | 40.0      |\n| Other assurance services                              | 1.2       | 0.4       | 0.6       |\n| Corporate finance services (3)                        | 0.5       | 0.5       | 0.4       |\n| Total other services                                  | 1.7       | 0.9       | 1.0       |\n\n## 7 Tax\n\nNatWest Group's corporate income tax charge for the period is set out below, together with a reconciliation to the expected tax charge calculated using the UK standard corporation tax rate and details of the NatWest Group's deferred tax balances.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 3.7.\n\n## A Annaallyyssiiss  ooff  tthhee  ttaaxx  cchhaarrggee  ffoorr  tthhee  yyeeaarr\n\nThe tax charge comprises current and deferred tax in respect of profits and losses recognised or originating in the income statement.

The tax treatment of some transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax charges in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n## D Deeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences where the carrying amount of an asset or liability differs for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities reflect the expected amount of tax payable in the future on these temporary differences. Deferred tax assets reflect the expected amount of tax recoverable in the future on these differences.\n\nThe net deferred tax asset recognised by the NatWest Group is shown below, together with details of the accounting judgments and tax rates that have been used to calculate the deferred tax. Details are also provided of any deferred tax assets or liabilities that have not been recognised on the balance sheet.\n\n## A Annaallyyssiiss  ooff  ddeeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx\n\n|                        | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m      |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax asset     | (2,178) | (1,195) |\n| Deferred tax liability | 227     | 359     |\n| Net deferred tax asset | (1,951) | (836)   |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n330\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 7 Tax continued\n\n|                                                              | Pension   | Accelerated capital allowances   | Expense Financial provisions instruments (1)   | Expense Financial provisions instruments (1)   | Tax losses carried forward   | Other   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                              | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m                               | \u00a3m                                             | \u00a3m                                             | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 January 2021                                            | (4)       | (64)                             | (85)                                           | 480                                            | (905)                        | (32)    | (610)   |\n| Charge/(credit) to income statement:                         |           |                                  |                                                |                                                |                              |         |         |\n| - continuing operations                                      | 19        | 21                               | (5)                                            | (10)                                           | (1)                          | (33)    | (9)     |\n| - discontinued operations                                    | -         | -                                | -                                              | -                                              | 3                            | -       | 3       |\n| Charge/(credit) to other comprehensive income                | 10        | -                                | (7)                                            | (222)                                          | -                            | (5)     | (224)   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments                   | (1)       | 1                                | -                                              | -                                              | 4                            | -       | 4       |\n| At 1 January 2022                                            | 24        | (42)                             | (97)                                           | 248                                            | (899)                        | (70)    | (836)   |\n| Charge/(credit) to income statement: - continuing operations | 1         | (43)                             | 14                                             | (171)                                          | (51)                         | 14      | (236)   |\n| - discontinued operations                                    | -         | -                                | -                                              | -                                              | -                            | -       | -       |\n| (Credit)/charge to other comprehensive income                | (2)       | -                                | 1                                              | (913)                                          | -                            | (2)     | (916)   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments                   | -         | 10                               | -                                              | 31                                             | (2)                          | (2)     | 37      |\n| At 31 December 2022                                          | 23        | (75)                             | (82)                                           | (805)                                          | (952)                        | (60)    | (1,951) |\n\nDeferred tax assets in respect of carried forward tax losses are recognised if the losses can be used to offset probable future taxable profits after taking into account the expected reversal of other temporary differences.

These include amounts recognised in respect of UK and overseas tax losses of \u00a3952 million (2021 \u00a3899 million).\n\nIt was announced in the UK Government's budget on 27 October 2021 that the UK banking surcharge will decrease from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023. This legislative change was enacted on 24 February 2022. NatWest Group's closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have therefore been recalculated taking into account this change of rate and the applicable period the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to crystallise.\n\nJudgment -NatWest Group has considered the carrying value of deferred tax assets and concluded that, based on management's estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover recognised deferred tax assets.\n\nEstimate - These estimates are partly based on forecast performance beyond the horizon for management's detailed plans. They have regard to inherent uncertainties, such as climate change.

Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further taxation. No taxation is expected to arise in the foreseeable future in respect of heldover gains on which deferred tax is not recognised.

Completion of this sale is expected to occur in Q2 2023.\n\nThe business activities relating to these sales that meet the requirements of IFRS 5 are presented as a discontinued operation and as a disposal group. Comparatives have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain items as discontinued operations. This has resulted in a re-presentation of 2021 comparatives: a reduction of Operating profit before tax and Profit from continuing operations of \u00a3188 million, and an increase of Profit from discontinued operations of \u00a3188 million. Total profit for the year remains unchanged. Ulster Bank RoI continuing operations are now reported within Group central items & other. In 2022 we reclassified mortgage loans to fair value through profit or loss, which resulted in a \u20ac453 million reduction in mortgage financial assets in UBIDAC to 31 December 2022. This reclassification applies across both our continuing and discontinued operations.\n\n## ( (aa))  ((LLoossss))//pprrooffiitt  ffrroomm  ddiissccoonnttiinnuueedd  ooppeerraattiioonnss,,  nneett  ooff  ttaaxx\n\n|                                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest receivable                                    | 177       | 339       | 360       |\n| Net interest income                                    | 177       | 339       | 360       |\n| Non-interest income (1)                                | (472)     | 13        | 33        |\n| Total income                                           | (295)     | 352       | 393       |\n| Operating expenses                                     | (38)      | (47)      | (47)      |\n| (Loss)/profit before impairment releases/(losses)      | (333)     | 305       | 346       |\n| Impairment releases/(losses)                           | 71        | 162       | (144)     |\n| Operating (loss)/profit before tax                     | (262)     | 467       | 202       |\n| Tax charge                                             | -         | (3)       | (9)       |\n| (Loss)/profit from discontinued operations, net of tax | (262)     | 464       | 193       |\n\n- (1) Excludes gain of \u00a320 million (\u20ac24 million) recognised by NatWest Group as a result of acquisition of PTSB shares in relation to disposal of UBIDAC assets to PTSB.\n\n## (b) Assets and liabilities of disposal groups\n\n|                                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets of disposal groups                   |           |           |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost         | 1,458     | 9,002     |\n| Other financial assets - loans to customers | 5,397     | -         |\n| Derivatives                                 | -         | 5         |\n| Other assets                                | 6         | 8         |\n|                                             | 6,861     | 9,015     |\n| Liabilities of disposal groups              |           |           |\n| Other liabilities                           | 15        | 5         |\n|                                             | 15        | 5         |\n| Net assets of disposal groups               | 6,846     | 9,010     |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n333",

Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive share options and convertible securities. The assessment of whether the effect of share options and convertible securities is dilutive or not, is based on the earnings from continuing operations.\n\n|                                                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Earnings                                                                         |           |           |           |\n| Profit/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders   | 3,602     | 2,486     | (946)     |\n| (Loss)/profit from discontinued operations attributable to ordinary shareholders | (262)     | 464       | 193       |\n| Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders                              | 3,340     | 2,950     | (753)     |\n| Weighted average number of shares (millions)                                     |           |           |           |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year           | 9,872     | 10,792    | 11,231    |\n| Effect of dilutive share options and convertible securities (1)                  | 57        | 45        | -         |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year   | 9,929     | 10,837    | 11,231    |\n\n## 10 Financial instruments - classification\n\nFinancial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a corresponding financial liability or equity instrument of a counterparty entity, such as: cash; derivatives; loans; deposits; and settlement balances. This note presents financial instruments classified in accordance with IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments.\n\n## J Juuddggmmeenntt::  ccllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  ooff  ffiinnaanncciiaall  aasssseettss\n\nClassification of financial assets between amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income requires a degree of judgment in respect of business models and contractual cashflows.\n\n- \uf02d The business model criteria is assessed at a portfolio level to determine whether assets are classified as held to collect or held to collect and sell. Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes the portfolio's policies and objectives, how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management; and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for sales.\n- \uf02d The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. A level of judgment is made in assessing terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for solely payments of principal and interest, including contingent and leverage features, non -recourse arrangements and features that could modify the time value of money.\n\nWe originate loans that include features that change the contractual cash flows based on the borrower meeting certain contractually specified environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets. These are known as ESG-linked (or sustainabilitylinked) loans. As part of the terms of these loans, the contractual interest rate is reduced or increased if the borrower meets (fails to meet) specific targets linked to the activity of the borrower for example reducing carbon emissions, increase the level of diversity at Board level, sustainable supply chain, etc. ESG features are first assessed to ascertain whether the adjustment to the contractual cash flows results in a de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in those contractual cash flows. If this is the case the classification of the loan is not affected. If the effect of the ESG feature is assessed as being more than de minimis, we apply judgement to ensure that the ESG features do not generate compensation for risks that are not in line with a basic lending arrangement. This includes amongst other aspects a review of the consistency of the ESG targets with the asset or activity of the borrower, consideration of the targets within our risk appetite etc. Some of these loans are an integral part of our climate and sustainable funding and financing target disclosed on page 25.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.12.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n334\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 10 Financial instruments -

On 1 July 2022 UBIDAC mortgages in both its continuing and discontinued businesses were reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through profit or loss, reflecting the change in business model. We fair value these assets using a discounted cash flow method. Key inputs include assumptions around cash flows from legally binding sales agreements for those mortgage assets that form part of the assets of disposal groups.\n\nThe effect of the reclassification as at 1 July 2022 is shown below:\n\n|                                       | Amortised cost \u00a3m   | MFVTPL \u00a3m   | Change in value \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Amounts reclassified on balance sheet |                     |             |                      |\n| Loans to customers (1)                | 587                 | 606         | 19                   |\n| Assets of disposal groups (2)         | 10,676              | 10,383      | (293)                |\n|                                       | 11,263              | 10,989      | (274)                |\n\n## A Addddiittiioonnaall  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn  oonn  ffiinnaannccee  lleeaassee  rreecceeiivvaabblleess\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of undiscounted finance lease receivables to net investment in finance leases:\n\n|                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Amount receivable under finance leases |           |           |\n| Within 1 year                          | 3,235     | 3,272     |\n| 1 to 2 years                           | 2,254     | 2,044     |\n| 2 to 3 years                           | 1,388     | 1,443     |\n| 3 to 4 years                           | 833       | 757       |\n| 4 to 5 years                           | 411       | 429       |\n| After 5 years                          | 1,130     | 1,423     |\n| Lease payments total                   | 9,251     | 9,368     |\n| Unguaranteed residual values           | 171       | 225       |\n| Future drawdowns                       | (13)      | (21)      |\n| Unearned income                        | (889)     | (891)     |\n| Present value of lease payments        | 8,520     | 8,681     |\n| Impairments                            | (118)     | (150)     |\n| Net investment in finance leases       | 8,402     | 8,531     |\n\n## A Addddiittiioonnaall  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn  oonn  rreevveerrssee  rreeppooss  aanndd  rreeppooss\n\nThe following table shows the value of reverse repos and repos included within the below balance sheet captions:\n\n|                                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reverse repos                       |           |           |\n| Trading assets                      | 21,537    | 20,742    |\n| Loans to banks - amortised cost     | 277       | 189       |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost | 19,750    | 25,962    |\n| Repos                               |           |           |\n| Bank deposits                       | 1,446     | 7,912     |\n| Customer deposits                   | 9,829     | 14,541    |\n| Trading liabilities                 | 23,740    | 19,389    |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n336\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 10 Financial instruments - classification continued\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  rraattee  bbeenncchhmmaarrkk  rreeffoorrmm\n\nNatWest Group continues to work on the transition of USD IBOR exposures to risk free rates in advance of the cessation date of 30 June 2023. Derivatives are expected to transition during April and May 2023 and other exposures in line with fallback provisions or deferred switches using widely accepted methodologies. The instruments yet to transition reflect an insignificant element of NatWest Group's exposures. Instruments with exposures to other rates transitioned at the end of 2021, or at the first contractual reset date, or at a date agreed with the counterparty.\n\nThe level of exposures without explicit or agreed conversion provisions as of the preceding year were as follows:\n\n|                                     | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                     | GBP LIBOR                      | USD IBOR                       | Other IBOR                     | Total                          |\n| 2021                                | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             |\n| Trading assets                      | 62                             | 90                             | -                              | 152                            |\n| Loans to banks - amortised cost     | -                              | 11                             | -                              | 11                             |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost | 4,788                          | 4,565                          | 267                            | 9,620                          |\n| Other financial assets              | 864                            | 768                            | -                              | 1,632                          |\n| Bank deposits                       | -                              | 37                             | -                              | 37                             |\n| Trading liabilities                 | 31                             | 166                            | -                              | 197                            |\n| Other financial liabilities         | 2,390                          | 7,023                          | 131                            | 9,544                          |\n| Subordinated liabilities            | -                              | 90                             | -                              | 90                             |\n| Loan commitments (1)                | 1,016                          | 6,366                          | 55                             | 7,437                          |\n| Derivatives notional (\u00a3bn)          | 4                              | 1,152                          | -                              | 1,156                          |\n\nAt 31 December 2021, NatWest Group held certain currency swaps with both legs subject to IBOR reform, for which only the GBP LIBOR leg has an explicit or agreed conversion provisions as of 31 December 2021, but not the entire contract. These include currency swaps of GBP LIBOR of \u00a38.7 billion with USD IBOR \u00a38.2 billion and Other IBOR \u00a30.5 billion; currency swaps of USD IBOR of \u00a3117 billion with GBP LIBOR \u00a391.7 billion and Other IBOR \u00a325.3 billion; currency swaps of EURIBOR of \u00a30.1 billion with GBP LIBOR \u00a30.1 billion; currency swaps of Other IBOR of \u00a30.4 billion with USD IBOR \u00a30.4 billion\n\n## A ATT11  iissssuuaanncceess\n\nNatWest Group has issued certain capital instruments, AT1, under which reset clauses are linked to IBOR rates subject to reform.

valuation\n\nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are revalued using techniques that can include observable inputs (pricing information that is readily available in the market, for example UK Government securities), and unobservable inputs (pricing information that is not readily available, for example unlisted securities). Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income as appropriate. This note presents information on the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the various sections contained within the note.\n\n## C Crriittiiccaall  aaccccoouunnttiinngg  ppoolliiccyy::  FFaaiirr  vvaalluuee  --  ffiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss\n\nFinancial instruments classified as mandatory fair value through profit or loss; held-for-trading; designated fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in the financial statements at fair value. All derivatives are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement considers the characteristics of the asset or liability and the assumptions that a market participant would consider when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nNatWest Group manages some portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities based on its net exposure to either market or credit risk. In these cases, the fair value is derived from the net risk exposure of that portfolio with portfolio level adjustments applied to incorporate bid-offer spreads, counterparty credit risk, and funding costs (see 'Valuation Adjustments').\n\nWhere the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques involve a degree of estimation, the extent of which depends on the instrument's complexity and the availability of market-based data. The complexity and uncertainty in the financial instrument's fair value is categorised using the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 3.8 and 3.12.\n\n|                                                                                                   | Page   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| F Fiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss                                                       |        |\n| Critical accounting policy: Fair value                                                            | 339    |\n| V Vaalluuaattiioonn                                                                               |        |\n| Fair value hierarchy (D)                                                                          | 339    |\n| Valuation techniques (D)                                                                          | 340    |\n| Inputs to valuation models (D)                                                                    | 340    |\n| Valuation control (D)                                                                             | 340    |\n| Key areas of judgment (D)                                                                         | 341    |\n| Table of assets and liabilities split by fair value      hierarchy level (T)                      | 342    |\n| V Vaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss                                                       |        |\n| Table of fair value adjustments made (T)                                                          | 343    |\n| Funding valuation adjustments (FVA) (D)                                                           | 343    |\n| Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) (D)                                                            | 343    |\n| Bid-offer (D)                                                                                     | 343    |\n| Product and deal specific (D)                                                                     | 343    |\n| Own credit (D)                                                                                    | 343    |\n| L Leevveell  33  aaddddiittiioonnaall  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn                                     |        |\n| Level 3 ranges of unobservable inputs (D)                                                         | 344    |\n| Table of level 3 instruments, valuation                                                           |        |\n| techniques and inputs  ( (TT))                                                                    | 344    |\n| Level 3 sensitivities (D)                                                                         | 345    |\n| Alternative assumptions (D)                                                                       | 345    |\n| Other considerations (D)                                                                          | 345    |\n| Table of high and low range of fair value of                                                      |        |\n| level 3 assets and liabilities  ( (TT))                                                           | 345    |\n| Movement in level 3 assets and liabilities                                                        |        |\n| over the reporting period (D)                                                                     | 346    |\n| Table of the movement in level 3 assets and liabilities                                           | 346    |\n| ( (TT)) F Faaiirr  vvaalluuee  ooff  ffiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss  mmeeaassuurreedd |        |\n| aatt  aammoorrttiisseedd  ccoosstt                                                                |        |\n| Table showing the fair value of financial instruments                                             |        |\n| (D) = Descriptive; (T) = Table                                                                    |        |\n| measured at amortised cost on the balance sheet  ( (TT))                                          | 347    |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n339\n\n## Valuation\n\n## F Faaiirr  vvaalluuee  hhiieerraarrcchhyy\n\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value have been classified under the fair value hierarchy. The classification ranges from level 1 to level 3, with more expert judgment and price uncertainty for those classified at level 3.\n\nThe determination of an instrument's level cannot be made at a global product level as a single product type can be in more than one level. For example, a single name corporate credit default swap could be in level 2 or level 3 depending on the level of market activity for the referenced entity .\n\nLevel 1 - instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active and liquid markets, for identical financial instruments. Examples include government bonds, listed equity shares and certain exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nLevel 2 - instruments valued using valuation techniques that have observable inputs. Observable inputs are those that are readily available with limited adjustments required. Examples include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products - including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, certain money market securities, loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.\n\nLevel 3 - instruments valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data. Examples include non-derivative instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, private equity, and derivatives with unobservable model inputs.",

Examples include equities and most debt securities.\n\nNon-modelled products can fall into any fair value levelling hierarchy depending on the observable market activity, liquidity, and assessment of valuation uncertainty of the instruments. The assessment of fair value and the classification of the instrument to a fair value level is subject to the valuation controls discussed in the Valuation control section.\n\nModelled products valued using a pricing model range in complexity from comparatively vanilla products such as interest rate swaps and options (e.g., interest rate caps and floors) through to more complex derivatives (e.g., balance guarantee swaps).\n\nFor modelled products the fair value is derived using the model and the appropriate model inputs or parameters, as opposed to a cash price equivalent. Model inputs are taken either directly or indirectly from available data, where some inputs are also modelled.\n\nFair value classification of modelled instruments is either level 2 or level 3, depending on the product/model combination, the observability and quality of input parameters and other factors. All these must be assessed to classify a position. The modelled product is assigned to the lowest fair value hierarchy level of any significant input used in that valuation.\n\nMost derivative instruments, for example vanilla interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and liquid single name credit derivatives, are classified as level 2. This is because they are vanilla products valued using standard market models and with observable inputs. Level 2 products range from vanilla to more complex products, where more complex products remain classified as level 2 due to the low materiality of any unobservable inputs.\n\n## I Innppuuttss  ttoo  vvaalluuaattiioonn  mmooddeellss\n\nWhen using valuation techniques, the fair value can be significantly affected by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions. Factors considered include the cashflow amounts and timing of those cash flows, and application of appropriate discount rates, incorporating both funding and credit risk. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and extrapolation. The principal inputs to these valuation techniques are as follows:\n\nBond prices - quoted prices are generally available for government bonds, certain corporate securities, and some mortgage-related products.\n\nCredit spreads - these express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the referenced credit risk. Where available, these are derived from the price of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. When direct prices are not available; credit spreads are determined with reference to available prices of entities with similar characteristics.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n340\n\nInterest rates - these are principally based on interest rate swap prices referencing benchmark interest rates. Benchmark rates include Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate, including SONIA (Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate). Other quoted interest rates may also be used from both the bond, and futures markets.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates - there are observable prices both for spot and forward contracts and futures in the world's major currencies.\n\nEquity and equity index prices - quoted prices are generally readily available for equity shares listed on the world's major stock exchanges and for major indices on such shares.\n\nPrice volatilities and correlations - volatility is a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time. Correlation measures the degree which two or more prices or variables are observed to move together. Variables that move in the same direction show positive correlation; those that move in opposite directions are negatively correlated.\n\nPrepayment rates - rates used to reflect how fast a pool of assets prepay. The fair value of a financial instrument that can be prepaid by the issuer or borrower differs from that of an instrument that cannot be prepaid. When valuing prepayable instruments, the value of this prepayment option is considered.\n\nRecovery rates/loss given default - these are used as an input to valuation models and reserves for asset-backed securities and other credit products as an indicator of severity of losses on default. Recovery rates are primarily sourced from market data providers, the value of the underlying collateral or inferred from observable credit spreads.\n\n## V Vaalluuaattiioonn  ccoonnttrrooll\n\nNatWest Group's control environment for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments includes formalised procedures for the review and validation of fair values. This review is performed by an independent price verification (IPV) team.\n\nIPV is a key element of the control environment. Valuations are first performed by the business which entered into the transaction. These valuations are then reviewed by the IPV team, independent of those trading the financial instruments, in light of available pricing evidence.\n\nIndependent pricing data is collated from a range of sources. Each source is reviewed for quality and the independent data applied in the IPV processes using a formalised input quality hierarchy. Consensus services are one source of independent data and encompass interest rate, currency, credit, and bond markets, providing comprehensive coverage of vanilla products and a wide selection of exotic products.\n\nWhere measurement differences are identified through the IPV process these are grouped by the quality hierarchy of the independent data. If the size of the difference exceeds defined thresholds, an adjustment is made to bring the valuation to within the independently calculated fair value range.\n\nIPV takes place at least monthly, for all fair value financial instruments. The IPV control includes formalised reporting and escalation of any valuation differences in breach of established thresholds.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 11 Financial instruments - valuation\n\n## continued\n\nThe quality and completeness of the information gathered in the IPV process gives an indication as to the liquidity and valuation uncertainty of an instrument and forms part of the information considered when determining fair value hierarchy classifications.\n\nInitial fair value level classification of a financial instrument is carried out by the IPV team. These initial classifications are subject to senior management review. Particular attention is paid to instruments transferring from one level to another, new instrument classes or products, instruments where the transaction price is significantly different from the fair value and instruments where valuation uncertainty is high.\n\nValuation Committees are made up of valuation specialists and senior business representatives from various functions and oversees pricing, reserving and valuations issues. These committees meet monthly to review and ratify any methodology changes. The Executive Valuation Committee meets quarterly to address key material and subjective valuation issues, to review items escalated by Valuation Committees and to discuss other relevant industry matters.\n\nThe Group model risk policy sets the policy for model documentation, testing and review. Governance of the model risk policy is carried out by the Group model risk oversight committee, which comprises model risk owners and independent model experts. All models are required to be independently validated in accordance with the Model Risk Policy.\n\n## K Keeyy  aarreeaass  ooff  jjuuddggmmeenntt\n\nOver the years the business has simplified, with most products classified as level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, the diverse range of products historically traded by NatWest Group means some products remain classified as level 3. Level 3 indicates a significant level of pricing uncertainty, where expert judgment is used. As such, extra disclosures are required in respect of level 3 instruments .\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n341\n\nIn general, the degree of expert judgment used and hence valuation uncertainty depends on the degree of liquidity of an instrument or input.\n\nWhere markets are liquid, little judgment is required. However, when the information regarding the liquidity in a particular market is not clear, a judgment may need to be made. For example, for an equity traded on an exchange, daily volumes of trading can be seen, but for an over the counter (OTC) derivative, assessing the liquidity of the market with no central exchange is more challenging.\n\nA key related matter is where a market moves from liquid to illiquid or vice versa. Where this movement is considered temporary, the fair value level is not changed. For example, if there is little market trading in a product on a reporting date but at the previous reporting date and during the intervening period the market has been liquid. In this case, the instrument will continue to be classified at the same level in the hierarchy. This is to provide consistency so that transfers between levels are driven by genuine changes in market liquidity and do not reflect short term or seasonal effects. Material movements between levels are reviewed quarterly by the Business and IPV. The breadth and depth of the IPV data allows for a rules-based quality assessment to be made of market activity, liquidity, and pricing uncertainty, which assists with the process of allocation to an appropriate level. Where suitable independent pricing information is not readily available, the quality assessment will result in the instrument being assessed as level 3.",

These adjustments are presented in the table below:\n\n| Adjustment                | 2 2002222 \u00a3 \u00a3mm   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Funding - FVA             | 1 17733           |        90 |\n| Credit - CVA              | 3 30000           |       390 |\n| Bid - Offer               | 1 13300           |       113 |\n| Product and deal specific | 1 14411           |       119 |\n|                           | 7 74444           |       712 |\n\nFunding valuation adjustments on the group defined benefit pension plan increased during the year, primarily driven by increases in GBP interest rates.\n\nThe decrease in CVA was driven by a reduction in exposures, primarily due to increases in interest rates and trade exit activity, partially offset by the net impact of credit spreads widening and specific counterparty activity. The increase in bid-offer was driven by the net impact of risk changes, wider bid-offer spreads and an increase in the estimated costs of exiting certain less liquid risks. The increase in product and deal specific was driven by credit spreads widening and specific counterparty activity.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss  ((FFVVAA))\n\nFVA represents an estimate of the adjustment that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs and benefits that arise in relation to derivative exposures. FVA is calculated as a portfolio level adjustment and can result in either a funding charge (positive) or funding benefit (negative).\n\nFunding levels are applied to estimated potential future exposures. For uncollateralised derivatives, the exposure reflects the future valuation of the derivative. For collateralised derivatives, the exposure reflects the difference between the future valuation of the derivative and the level of collateral posted.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss  ((CCVVAA))\n\nCVA represents an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that is made to incorporate the counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative exposures. CVA is actively managed by a credit and market risk hedging process, and therefore movements in CVA are partially offset by trading revenue on the hedges.\n\nThe CVA is calculated on a portfolio basis reflecting an estimate of the amount a third party would charge to assume the credit risk.\n\nCollateral held under a credit support agreement is factored into the CVA calculation. In such cases where NatWest Group holds collateral against counterparty exposures, CVA is held to the extent that residual risk remains.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n343\n\n## B Biidd--ooffffeerr\n\nFair value positions are required to be marked to exit, represented by bid (long positions) or offer (short positions) levels. Non-derivative positions are typically marked directly to bid or offer prices. However derivative exposures are adjusted to exit levels by taking bid-offer reserves calculated on a portfolio basis. The bid-offer approach is based on current market spreads and standard market bucketing of risk.\n\nBid-offer spreads vary by maturity and risk type to reflect different spreads in the market. For positions where there is no observable quote, the bid-offer spreads are widened in comparison to proxies to reflect reduced liquidity or observability.\n\nNetting is applied on a portfolio basis to reflect the value at which NatWest Group believes it could exit the net risk of the portfolio, rather than the sum of exit costs for each of the portfolio's individual trades. This is applied where the asset and liability positions are managed as a portfolio for risk and reporting purposes.\n\n## P Prroodduucctt  aanndd  ddeeaall  ssppeecciiffiicc\n\nOn initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques which have a significant dependence on information other than observable market data, any difference between the transaction price and that derived from the valuation technique is deferred. Such amounts are recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction; when market data becomes observable; or when the transaction matures or is closed out as appropriate. On 31 December 2022, net gains of \u00a374 million (2021 - \u00a371 million) were carried forward. During the year, net gains of \u00a397 million (2021 - \u00a3103 million) were deferred and \u00a394 million (2021 - \u00a394 million) were recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere system generated valuations do not accurately reflect market prices, manual valuation adjustments are applied either at a position or portfolio level. Manual adjustments are subject to the scrutiny of independent control teams and are subject to monthly review by senior management.\n\n## O Owwnn  CCrreeddiitt\n\nNatWest Group considers the effect of its own credit standing when valuing financial liabilities recorded at fair value. Own credit spread adjustments are made when valuing issued debt held at fair value, including issued structured notes. An own credit adjustment is applied to positions where it is believed that counterparties would consider NatWest Group's creditworthiness when pricing trades.",

As individual sensitivities are aggregated with no reflection of the correlated nature between instruments, the overall portfolio sensitivity may not be accurately reflected. For example, some portfolios may be negatively correlated to others, where a downwards movement in one asset would produce an upwards movement in another. However, due to the additive presentation of the above figures this correlation impact cannot be displayed. As such, the actual potential downside sensitivity of the total portfolio may be less than the non-correlated sum of the additive figures as shown in the below table.\n\n## A Alltteerrnnaattiivvee  aassssuummppttiioonnss\n\nReasonably plausible alternative assumptions of unobservable inputs are determined based on a specified target level of certainty of 90%.\n\nAlternative assumptions are determined with reference to all available evidence including consideration of the following: quality of independent pricing information considering consistency between different sources, variation over time, perceived tradability or otherwise of available quotes; consensus service dispersion ranges; volume of trading activity and market bias (e.g. one-way inventory); day 1 profit or loss arising on new trades; number and nature of market participants; market conditions; modelling consistency in the market; size and nature of risk; length of holding of position; and market intelligence.\n\n## O Otthheerr  ccoonnssiiddeerraattiioonnss\n\nWhilst certain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA and own credit adjustments are not based on observable market data, the uncertainty of these inputs is not considered to have a significant effect on the net valuation of the related derivative portfolios and issued debt.\n\nAs such, the fair value levelling of the derivative portfolios and issued debt is not determined by CVA, FVA or own credit inputs. In addition, any fair value sensitivity driven by these inputs is not included in the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\nThe table below shows the high and low range of fair value of the level 3 assets and liabilities. This range incorporates the range of fair value inputs as described in the previous table.\n\n|                          | 2022       | 2022          | 2022            | 2021       | 2021          | 2021            |\n|--------------------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|\n|                          | Level 3 \u00a3m | Favourable \u00a3m | Unfavourable \u00a3m | Level 3 \u00a3m | Favourable \u00a3m | Unfavourable \u00a3m |\n| Assets                   |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Trading assets           |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Loans                    | 395        | 10            | (10)            | 721        | 10            | (10)            |\n| Securities               | 1          | -             | -               | 21         | -             | -               |\n| Derivatives              | 1,007      | 50            | (50)            | 917        | 60            | (70)            |\n| Other financial assets   |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Loans                    | 727        | -             | (10)            | 207        | 10            | (10)            |\n| Securities               | 203        | 20            | (30)            | 186        | 20            | (20)            |\n|                          | 2,333      | 80            | (100)           | 2,052      | 100           | (110)           |\n| Liabilities              |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Trading liabilities      |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Deposits                 | 1          | -             | -               | 2          | -             | -               |\n| Debt securities in issue | -          | -             | -               | -          | -             | -               |\n| Short positions          | -          | -             | -               | 1          |               | -               |\n| Derivatives              | 975        | 30            | (30)            | 606        | 30            | (30)            |\n|                          | 976        | 30            | (30)            | 609        | 30            | (30)            |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n345",

Two principal methods are used to estimate fair value:\n\n- (a) Contractual cashflows that are discounted using a market discount rate that incorporates the current spread for the borrower or where this is not observable, the spread for borrowers of a similar credit standing.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n347\n\n- (b) Expected cash flows (unadjusted for credit losses) are discounted at the current offer rate for the same or similar products. The current methodology caps all loan values at par rather than modelling clients' option to repay loans early. This approach is adopted for lending portfolios in Retail Banking, Ulster Bank RoI, Commercial & Institutional (SME loans) and Private Banking in order to reflect the homogeneous nature of these portfolios.\n\n## D Deebbtt  sseeccuurriittiieess  aanndd  ssuubboorrddiinnaatteedd  lliiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nMost debt securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets or from quoted prices of similar financial instruments.

The balances in the following tables do not agree directly with the consolidated balance sheet, as the tables include all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments, presented on an undiscounted basis. The tables have been prepared on the following basis:\n\nFinancial assets have been reflected in the time band of the latest date on which they could be repaid, unless earlier repayment can be demanded by NatWest Group. Financial liabilities are included at the earliest date on which the counterparty can require repayment, regardless of whether or not such early repayment results in a penalty. If the repayment of a financial instrument is triggered by, or is subject to, specific criteria such as market price hurdles being reached, the asset is included in the time band that contains the latest date on which it can be repaid, regardless of early repayment.\n\nThe liability is included in the time band that contains the earliest possible date on which the conditions could be fulfilled, without considering the probability of the conditions being met.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n348\n\nFor example, if a structured note is automatically prepaid when an equity index exceeds a certain level, the cash outflow will be included in the less than three months period, whatever the level of the index at the year end. The settlement date of debt securities in issue, issued by certain securitisation vehicles consolidated by NatWest Group, depends on when cash flows are received from the securitised assets. Where these assets are prepayable, the timing of the cash outflow relating to securities assumes that each asset will be prepaid at the earliest possible date. As the repayments of assets and liabilities are linked, the repayment of assets in securitisations is shown on the earliest date that the asset can be prepaid, as this is the basis used for liabilities.\n\nThe principal amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are repayable after 20 years or where the counterparty has no right to repayment of the principal are excluded from the table, as are interest payments after 20 years.\n\nThe maturity of guarantees and commitments is based on the earliest possible date they would be drawn in order to evaluate NatWest Group's liquidity position.\n\nMFVTPL assets of \u00a3145.8 billion (2021 - \u00a3165.6 billion) and HFT liabilities of \u00a3146.7 billion (2021 - \u00a3165.3 billion) have been excluded from the following tables.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 12 Financial instruments -

This note shows contracted volumes of derivatives, how they are used for hedging purposes and more specifically the effects of the application of hedge accounting.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 3.8 and 3.12.\n\n|                                | 2022         | 2022      | 2022           | 2021         | 2021      | 2021           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|\n|                                | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Exchange rate contracts        | 3,168        | 45,829    | 45,237         | 3,167        | 38,517    | 39,286         |\n| Interest rate contracts        | 10,742       | 53,480    | 48,535         | 8,919        | 67,458    | 61,206         |\n| Credit derivatives             | 15           | 236       | 275            | 14           | 154       | 343            |\n| Equity and commodity contracts | -            | -         | -              | -            | 10        | -              |\n|                                |              | 99,545    | 94,047         |              | 106,139   | 100,835        |\n\nNatWest Group applies hedge accounting to reduce the accounting mismatch caused in the income statement by using derivatives to hedge the following risks: interest rate, foreign exchange and the foreign exchange risk associated with net investment in foreign operations.\n\nNatWest Group's interest rate hedging relates to the management of NatWest Group's non-trading structural interest rate risk, caused by the mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates on its financial instruments. NatWest Group manages this risk within approved limits. Residual risk positions are hedged with derivatives, principally interest rate swaps.\n\nSuitable larger fixed rate financial instruments are subject to fair value hedging in line with documented risk management strategies\n\nCash flow hedges of interest rate risk relate to exposures to the variability in future interest payments and receipts due to the movement of benchmark interest rates on forecast transactions and on financial assets and financial liabilities. This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps, which convert variable cash flows into fixed. For these cash flow hedge relationships, the hedged items are actual and forecast variable interest rate cash flows arising from financial assets and financial liabilities with interest rates linked to the relevant benchmark rates, most notably USD LIBOR, SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA and the Bank of England Official Bank Rate. The variability in cash flows due to movements in the relevant benchmark rate is hedged; this risk component is identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group and encompasses the majority of cash flow variability risk.\n\nFair value hedges of interest rate risk involve interest rate swaps transforming the fixed interest rate risk in financial assets and financial liabilities to floating. The hedged risk is the risk of changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate risk component of the hedged item. The significant benchmarks identified as risk components are USD LIBOR, SOFR, EURIBOR and SONIA. These risk components are identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group and encompass the majority of the hedged item's fair value risk.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n351\n\nNatWest Group hedges the exchange rate risk of its net investment in foreign currency denominated operations with currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts. NatWest Group reviews the value of the investments' net assets, executing hedges where appropriate to reduce the sensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movement. Hedge accounting relationships will be designated where required.\n\nExchange rate risk also arises in NatWest Group where payments are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Residual risk positions are hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts, fixing the exchange rate the payments will be settled in. The derivatives are documented as cash flow hedges.\n\nFor all cash flow hedging and fair value hedge relationships, and net investment hedging, NatWest Group determines that there is an adequate level of offsetting between the hedged item and hedging instrument at inception and on an ongoing basis. This is achieved by comparing movements in the fair value of the expected highly probable forecast cash flows/fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk with movements in the fair value of the expected changes in cash flows from the hedging instruments. The method used for comparing movements is either regression testing or the dollar offset method. The method for testing effectiveness and the period over which the test is performed depends on the applicable risk management strategy and is applied consistently to each risk management strategy. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a cumulative basis and the determination of effectiveness is in line with the requirements of IAS39.\n\nNatWest Group uses either the actual ratio between the hedged item and hedging instrument(s) or one that minimises hedge ineffectiveness to establish the hedge ratio for hedge accounting. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured in line with the requirements of IAS39 and recognised in the income statement as it arises.",

At 31 December 2022, customer loan impairment provisions amounted to \u00a33,434 million (2021 \u00a33,806 million). A loan is impaired when there is objective evidence that the cash flows will not occur in the manner expected when the loan was advanced. Such evidence includes, changes in the credit rating of a borrower, the failure to make payments in accordance with the loan agreement, significant reduction in the value of any security, breach of limits or covenants, and observable data about relevant macroeconomic measures.\n\nThe impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of estimated future cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe measurement of credit impairment under the IFRS expected loss model depends on management's assessment of any potential deterioration in the creditworthiness of the borrower, its modelling of expected performance and the application of economic forecasts. All three elements require judgments that are potentially significant to the estimate of impairment losses.

No impairment was indicated at 31 December 2022. In 2021 goodwill in the Retail Banking segment was impaired by \u00a385 million.\n\nNatWest Group's goodwill acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually at 31 December by cashgenerating unit (CGU) (2022 and 2021: Retail Banking \u00a32,607 million; Commercial Banking \u00a32,606 million; Private Banking \u00a39 million; and RBS International \u00a3300 million). Analysis by reportable segment is in Note 4 Segmental analysis.\n\nImpairment testing involves the comparison of the carrying value of each CGU with its recoverable amount. The carrying values of the segments reflect the equity allocations made by management, which are consistent with NatWest Group's capital targets.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n358\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amounts for all CGUs at 31 December 2022 were based on value in use, using management's latest fiveyear revenue and cost forecasts. These are discounted cash flow projections over five years. The forecast is then extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to compute a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the value in use. The long-term growth rates have been based on expected growth of the CGUs (2022: 1.4% and 2021: 1.6%). The pre-tax risk discount rates are based on those observed to be applied to businesses regarded as peers of the CGUs (2022: 15.3% for Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Private Banking, 14% for RBS International, and 2021: 13.9% for Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Private Banking, 12.1% for RBS International).\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 18 Other assets\n\nOther assets are not financial assets and reflect a grouping of assets that are not large enough to present separately on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                         | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interests in associates (1)             | 688       | 716       |\n| Property, plant and equipment (2)       | 4,240     | 4,230     |\n| Pension schemes in net surplus (Note 5) | 318       | 602       |\n| Prepayments                             | 340       | 360       |\n| Accrued income                          | 327       | 248       |\n| Tax recoverable                         | 279       | 190       |\n| Deferred tax (Note 7)                   | 2,178     | 1,195     |\n| Acceptances                             | 237       | 225       |\n| Other                                   | 569       | 476       |\n| Other assets                            | 9,176     | 8,242     |\n\n## 19 Other financial liabilities\n\nOther financial liabilities consist of customer deposits designated at fair value and debt securities in issue.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 3.8 and 3.11.\n\n|                                                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Customer deposits - designated as at fair value through profit or loss | 1,050     | 568       |\n| Debt securities in issue                                               |           |           |\n| - MRELs                                                                | 22,265    | 23,422    |\n| - Other medium term notes                                              | 16,419    | 12,430    |\n| - Commercial paper and certificates of deposit                         | 5,672     | 9,153     |\n| - Covered bonds                                                        | 2,842     | 2,886     |\n| - Securitisation                                                       | 859       | 867       |\n| Total                                                                  | 49,107    | 49,326    |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n359",

There is often a high degree of uncertainty and judgment is based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events in determining whether there is a present obligation. Judgment is also involved in estimation of the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. Where NatWest Group can look to another party such as an insurer to pay some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision, any reimbursement is recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that it will be received.\n\nEstimates - Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, the outflow of economic benefit is probable and the outflow can be estimated reliably.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n361\n\nAny difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect the reported results in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n- \uf02d Customer redress: Provisions reflect the estimated cost of redress attributable to claims where it is determined that a present obligation exists.\n- \uf02d Litigation and other regulatory: NatWest Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and in overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 26.\n- \uf02d Property: This includes provision for contractual costs associated with vacant properties.\n- \uf02d Other provisions: These materially comprise provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring costs.

At 31 December 2022, the directors had authority granted at the 2022 Annual General Meeting to issue up to \u00a3561,452,512 nominal of ordinary shares other than by preemption to existing shareholders.

Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting available at natwestgroup.com. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting in 2022, and amended at the General Meeting held on 25 August 2022 to preserve the position as if the share consolidation had not taken place.

The capital maintenance provisions of UK companies legislation apply to the capital redemption reserve as if it were part of the company's paid up share capital. On 15 June 2017, the Court of Session approved a reduction of NatWest plc capital so that the amounts which stood to the credit of the capital redemption reserve were transferred to retained earnings. The nominal value of the shares bought back from HM Treasury in March 2021 and via the Programme during 2022 have been transferred to the Capital redemption reserve.\n\nOwn shares held -at 31 December 2022, 13 million ordinary shares of \u00a31.0769 each of the company (2021 - 15 million) were\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n363\n\nheld by employee share trusts in respect of share awards and options granted to employees.

The company retains the flexibility to use newly issued shares, shares purchased by the NatWest Group Employee Share Ownership Trust and any available treasury shares to satisfy obligations under its employee share plans. The company does not use performance conditions or targets based on earnings per share (EPS), total shareholder return (TSR), and net asset value (NAV) in connection with its employee share plans.\n\nAs part of the shares bought back from HM Treasury in March 2021, the company transferred 200 million ordinary shares to treasury. The company has used a total of 76,513,524 treasury shares to satisfy the exercise of options and the vesting of share awards under the employee share plans. The balance of ordinary shares held in treasury as at 31 December 2022 was 114,011,084. The figure has been adjusted to reflect the 13 for 14 share consolidation on 30 August 2022.\n\nNatWest Group plc optimises capital efficiency by maintaining reserves in subsidiaries, including regulated entities. Certain preference shares and subordinated debt are also included within regulatory capital. The remittance of reserves to the company or the redemption of shares or subordinated capital by regulated entities may be subject to maintaining the capital resources required by the relevant regulator.\n\nUK law prescribes that only the reserves of the company are taken into account for the purpose of making distributions and in determining permissible applications of the share premium account.",

In carrying out this policy, NatWest Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the PRA. The PRA uses capital ratios as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets (the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks); by international agreement, the Pillar 1 capital ratios should be not less than 8% with a Common Equity Tier 1 component of not less than 4.5%. NatWest Group has complied with the PRA's capital requirements throughout the year.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n366\n\nA number of subsidiaries and sub-groups within NatWest Group, principally banking entities, are subject to various individual regulatory capital requirements in the UK and overseas. Furthermore, the payment of dividends by subsidiaries and the ability of members of NatWest Group to lend money to other members of NatWest Group may be subject to restrictions such as local regulatory or legal requirements, the availability of reserves and financial and operating performance.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 26 Memorandum items\n\n## C Coonnttiinnggeenntt  lliiaabbiilliittiieess  aanndd  ccoommmmiittmmeennttss\n\nNatWest Group provides its customers with a variety of services to support their businesses, such as guarantees. These are reported as commitments. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations dependent on a future event or present obligations which are either not probable or cannot be measured reliably.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 2.4.\n\nThe amounts shown in the table below are intended only to provide an indication of the volume of business outstanding at 31 December 2022. Although NatWest Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of a customer's failure to meet its obligations, the amounts shown do not, and are not intended to, provide any indication of NatWest Group's expectation of future losses.\n\n|                                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Guarantees                                             | 3,150     | 2,055     |\n| Other contingent liabilities                           | 1,855     | 2,004     |\n| Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments | 121,576   | 121,308   |\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments                 | 126,581   | 125,367   |\n\nBanking commitments and contingent obligations, which have been entered into on behalf of customers and for which there are corresponding obligations from customers, are not included in assets and liabilities. NatWest Group's maximum exposure to credit loss, in the event of its obligation crystallising and all counterclaims, collateral or security proving valueless, is represented by the contractual nominal amount of these instruments included in the table above. These commitments and contingent obligations are subject to NatWest Group's normal credit approval processes.\n\nGuarantees - NatWest Group gives guarantees on behalf of customers. A financial guarantee represents an irrevocable undertaking that NatWest Group will meet a customer's specified obligations to third party if the customer fails to do so. The maximum amount that NatWest Group could be required to pay under a guarantee is its principal amount as disclosed in the table above. NatWest Group expects most guarantees it provides to expire unused.\n\nStandby facilities and credit lines - under a loan commitment, NatWest Group agrees to make funds available to a customer in the future. Loan commitments, which are usually for a specified term, may be unconditionally cancellable or may persist, provided all conditions in the loan facility are satisfied or waived. Commitments to lend include commercial standby facilities and credit lines, liquidity facilities to commercial paper conduits and unutilised overdraft facilities.\n\nOther commitments - these include documentary credits, which are commercial letters of credit providing for payment by NatWest Group to a named beneficiary against presentation of specified documents, forward asset purchases, forward deposits placed and undrawn note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities, and other short-term trade related transactions.\n\nOther contingent liabilities - these include standby letters of credit, supporting customer debt issues and contingent liabilities relating to customer trading activities such as those arising from performance and customs bonds, warranties and indemnities.\n\n## Contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts\n\nThe following table shows contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts at the year end.\n\n|                                                      |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment |         8 |        16 |\n| Contracts to purchase goods or services (1)          |       677 |       682 |\n|                                                      |       685 |       698 |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n367",

NatWest Group earned fee income of \u00a3266 million (2021 - \u00a3280 million; 2020 - \u00a3245 million) from these activities.\n\n## T Thhee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  SSeerrvviicceess  CCoommppeennssaattiioonn  SScchheemmee\n\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK's statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms, pays compensation if a firm is unable to meet its obligations. The FSCS funds compensation for customers by raising management expenses levies and compensation levies on the industry. In relation to protected deposits, each deposit-taking institution contributes towards these levies in proportion to their share of total protected deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year (which runs from 1 April to 31 March), subject to annual maxima set by the Prudential Regulation Authority. In addition, the FSCS has the power to raise levies on a firm that has ceased to participate in the scheme and is in the process of ceasing to be authorised for the costs that it would have been liable to pay had the FSCS made a levy in the financial year it ceased to be a participant in the scheme.\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\nNatWest Group plc and certain members of NatWest Group are party to legal proceedings and involved in regulatory matters, including as the subject of investigations and other regulatory and governmental action (Matters) in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group recognises a provision for a liability in relation to these Matters when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation resulting from past events, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nIn many of these Matters, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable, or to estimate reliably the amount of any loss, either as a direct consequence of the relevant proceedings and regulatory matters or as a result of adverse impacts or restrictions on NatWest Group's reputation, businesses and operations. Numerous legal and factual issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and document production exercises and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before a liability can reasonably be estimated for any claim. NatWest Group cannot predict if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, damages, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages.\n\nThere are situations where NatWest Group may pursue an approach that in some instances leads to a settlement agreement. This may occur in order to avoid the expense, management distraction or reputational implications of continuing to contest liability, or in order to take account of the risks inherent in defending claims or regulatory matters, even for those Matters for which NatWest Group believes it has credible defences and should prevail on the merits. The uncertainties inherent in all such Matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both Matters with respect to which provisions have been established and other contingent liabilities in respect of any such Matter.\n\n368\n\nIt is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.\n\nThe future outflow of resources in respect of any Matter may ultimately prove to be substantially greater than or less than the aggregate provision that NatWest Group has recognised. Where (and as far as) liability cannot be reasonably estimated, no provision has been recognised. NatWest Group expects that in future periods, additional provisions, settlement amounts and customer redress payments will be necessary, in amounts that are expected to be substantial in some instances. Please refer to Note 21 for information on material provisions.\n\nMatters which are, or could be material, having regard to NatWest Group, considered as a whole, in which NatWest Group is currently involved are set out below. We have provided information on the procedural history of certain Matters, where we believe appropriate, to aid the understanding of the Matter.\n\nFor a discussion of certain risks associated with NatWest Group's litigation and regulatory matters, see the Risk Factors relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on pages 423 to 424.\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) litigation in the US\n\nNatWest Group companies continue to defend RMBS-related claims in the US in which the plaintiff, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), alleges that certain disclosures made in connection with the relevant offerings of RMBS contained materially false or misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the mortgage loans underlying the RMBS were issued.\n\n## London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other rates litigation\n\nNWM Plc and certain other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, are defendants in a number of class actions and individual claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) with respect to the setting of LIBOR and certain other benchmark interest rates. The complaints allege that certain members of NatWest Group and other panel banks violated various federal laws, including the US commodities and antitrust laws, and state statutory and common law, as well as contracts, by manipulating LIBOR and prices of LIBOR-based derivatives in various markets through various means.\n\nSeveral purported class actions relating to USD LIBOR, as well as more than two dozen non-class actions concerning USD LIBOR, are part of a co-ordinated proceeding in the SDNY. The class actions include claims on behalf of persons who purchased LIBOR-linked instruments from defendants, bonds issued by defendants, persons who transacted futures and options on exchanges, and lenders who made LIBOR-based loans. The coordinated proceeding is currently in the discovery phase. In March 2020, NatWest Group companies finalised a settlement resolving the class action on behalf of bondholder plaintiffs (those who held bonds issued by non-defendants on which interest was paid from 2007 to 2010 at a rate expressly tied to USD LIBOR). The amount of the settlement (which was covered by an existing provision) was paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 26 Memorandum items continued\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\nThe non-class claims filed in the SDNY include claims that the FDIC is asserting on behalf of certain failed US banks. In July 2017, the FDIC, on behalf of 39 of those failed US banks, commenced substantially similar claims against NatWest Group companies and others in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. The action alleges collusion with regard to the setting of USD LIBOR and that the defendants breached UK and European competition law, as well as asserting common law claims of fraud under US law. The defendant banks consented to a request by the FDIC for discontinuance of the claim in respect of 20 failed US banks, leaving 19 failed US banks as claimants. The trial is currently anticipated to take place in Q4 2025.\n\nIn addition to the USD LIBOR cases described above, there are two class actions relating to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR that remain outstanding. The first class action, which relates to Euroyen TIBOR futures contracts, was dismissed by the SDNY in September 2020 on jurisdictional and other grounds, and that decision was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals in October 2022. The plaintiffs have petitioned the court for a rehearing of their appeal. The second class action, which relates to other derivatives allegedly tied to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR, was dismissed by the SDNY in relation to NWM Plc and other NatWest Group companies in September 2021. That dismissal may be the subject of a future appeal .\n\nTwo other IBOR-related class actions, concerning alleged manipulation of Euribor and Pound Sterling LIBOR, were previously dismissed by the SDNY for various reasons. The plaintiffs' appeals in those two cases remain pending.\n\nIn June 2021, NWM Plc and the plaintiffs in the Swiss Franc LIBOR class action finalised a settlement resolving that case. The amount of that settlement has been paid into escrow pending final court approval of the settlement.\n\nSettlements in the class action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the class action relating to the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received court approval in 2022, such that the settlements became final and the amounts previously paid into escrow were released to the plaintiffs.\n\nIn August 2020, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several United States retail borrowers against the USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and their affiliates (including NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc), alleging (i) that the very process of setting USD ICE LIBOR amounts to illegal pricefixing; and (ii) that banks in the United States have illegally agreed to use LIBOR as a component of price in variable retail loans. In September 2022, the district court dismissed the complaint, subject to re-pleading by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in October 2022, which the defendants are again seeking to have dismissed.\n\nNWM Plc is also named as a defendant in a motion to certify a class action relating to LIBOR in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel. NWM Plc filed a motion for cancellation of service outside the jurisdiction, which was granted in July 2020. The claimants appealed that decision and in November 2020 the appeal was refused and the claim dismissed by the Appellate Court. The claim could in future be recommenced depending on the outcome of an appeal to Israel's Supreme Court in respect of the dismissal of the substantive case against banks that had a presence in Israel.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n369\n\n## FX litigation\n\nNWM Plc, NWMSI and/or NatWest Group plc are defendants in several cases relating to NWM Plc's foreign exchange (FX) business. In 2015, NWM Plc paid US$255 million to settle the consolidated antitrust class action filed in the SDNY on behalf of persons who entered into over-the-counter FX transactions with defendants or who traded FX instruments on exchanges. In 2018, some members of the settlement class who opted out of that class action settlement filed their own non-class complaint in the SDNY asserting antitrust claims against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks.\n\nIn April 2019, some of the claimants in the opt-out case described above, as well as others, served proceedings in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, asserting competition claims against NWM Plc and several other banks. The claim was transferred from the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in December 2021 and registered in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in January 2022. In December 2022, NWM Plc reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, to resolve both the SDNY and CAT cases. The settlement amount to be paid by NWM Plc is covered by an existing provision.\n\nAn FX-related class action, on behalf of 'consumers and enduser businesses', is proceeding in the SDNY against NWM Plc and others. In March 2022, the SDNY denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Plaintiffs sought an immediate appeal of the decision but the appellate court declined to review the decision. As a result, the case is proceeding on an individual, non-class basis, and the defendants are seeking summary judgment dismissing the individual claims.\n\nIn May 2019, a cartel class action was filed in the Federal Court of Australia against NWM Plc and four other banks on behalf of persons who bought or sold currency through FX spots or forwards between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013 with a total transaction value exceeding AUD $0.5 million. The claimant has alleged that the banks, including NWM Plc, contravened Australian competition law by sharing information, coordinating conduct, widening spreads and manipulating FX rates for certain currency pairs during this period. NatWest Group plc and NWMSI have been named in the action as 'other cartel participants', but are not respondents. The claim was served in June 2019 and NWM Plc filed its defence in March 2022.\n\nIn July and December 2019, two separate applications seeking opt-out collective proceedings orders were filed in the CAT against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other banks. Both applications were brought on behalf of persons who, between 18 December 2007 and 31 January 2013, entered into a relevant FX spot or outright forward transaction in the EEA with a relevant financial institution or on an electronic communications network. In March 2022, the CAT declined to certify as collective proceedings either of the applications. In October 2022, the CAT granted permission for the applicants to appeal that decision to the Court of Appeal. Separately, the applicants have served judicial review proceedings, which are due to be heard together with the appeal to the Court of Appeal in April 2023.\n\nTwo motions to certify FX-related class actions were filed in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel in September and October 2018, and were subsequently consolidated into one motion. The consolidated motion to certify, which names The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (now NWM Plc) and several other banks as defendants, was served on NWM Plc in May 2020. The applicants have sought the court's permission to amend their motions to certify the class actions.",

That NWM Plc motion remains pending.\n\nIn December 2021, a claim was issued in the Netherlands against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and NWM N.V. by Stichting FX Claims, seeking a declaration from the court that anti-competitive FX market conduct described in decisions of the European Commission (EC) of 16 May 2019 is unlawful, along with unspecified damages. The claimant has amended its claim to also refer to a December 2021 decision by the EC, which also described anti-competitive FX market conduct. The defendants are contesting the jurisdiction of the Dutch court.\n\nCertain other foreign exchange transaction related claims have been or may be threatened. NatWest Group cannot predict whether all or any of these claims will be pursued.\n\n## Government securities antitrust litigation\n\nNWMSI and certain other US broker-dealers are defendants in a consolidated antitrust class action in the SDNY on behalf of persons who transacted in US Treasury securities or derivatives based on such instruments, including futures and options. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants rigged the US Treasury securities auction bidding process to deflate prices at which they bought such securities and colluded to increase the prices at which they sold such securities to the plaintiffs. In March 2022, the SDNY dismissed the complaint, without leave to replead. The plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal.\n\nClass action antitrust claims commenced in March 2019 are pending in the SDNY against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks in respect of Euro-denominated bonds issued by European central banks (EGBs). The complaint alleges a conspiracy among dealers of EGBs to widen the bid-ask spreads they quoted to customers, thereby increasing the prices customers paid for the EGBs or decreasing the prices at which customers sold the bonds. The class consists of those who purchased or sold EGBs in the US between 2007 and 2012. In March 2022, the SDNY dismissed the claims against NWM Plc and NWMSI on the ground that the complaint's conspiracy allegations are insufficient. The plaintiffs have filed a motion for permission to file an amended complaint.\n\n## Swaps antitrust litigation\n\nNWM Plc and other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, as well as a number of other interest rate swap dealers, are defendants in several cases pending in the SDNY alleging violations of the US antitrust laws in the market for interest rate swaps. There is a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of persons who entered into interest rate swaps with the defendants, as well as non-class action claims by three swap execution facilities (TeraExchange, Javelin, and trueEx). The plaintiffs allege that the swap execution facilities would have successfully established exchange-like trading of interest rate swaps if the defendants had not unlawfully conspired to prevent that from happening through boycotts and other means. Discovery in these cases is complete, and the plaintiffs' motion for class certification remains pending.\n\nIn June 2021, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against a number of credit default swap dealers in New Mexico federal court on behalf of persons who, from 2005 onwards, settled credit default swaps in the United States by reference to the ISDA credit default swap auction protocol. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to manipulate that benchmark through various means in violation of the antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\n370\n\nThe defendants include several NatWest Group companies, including NatWest Group plc. Defendants are seeking dismissal.\n\n## Odd lot corporate bond trading antitrust litigation\n\nIn October 2021, the SDNY granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the class action antitrust complaint alleging that from August 2006 onwards various securities dealers, including NWMSI, conspired artificially to widen spreads for odd lots of corporate bonds bought or sold in the United States secondary market and to boycott electronic trading platforms that would have allegedly promoted pricing competition in the market for such bonds. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal.\n\n## Spoofing litigation\n\nIn December 2021, three substantially similar class actions complaints were filed in federal court in the United States against NWM Plc and NWMSI alleging Commodity Exchange Act and common law unjust enrichment claims arising from manipulative trading known as spoofing. The complaints refer to NWM Plc's December 2021 spoofing-related guilty plea (described below under 'US investigations relating to fixedincome securities') and purport to assert claims on behalf of those who transacted in US Treasury securities and futures and options on US Treasury securities between 2008 and 2018. In July 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss these claims, which have been consolidated into one matter in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\n## Madoff\n\nNWM N.V. was named as a defendant in two actions filed by the trustee for the bankrupt estates of Bernard L. Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in bankruptcy court in New York, which together seek to clawback more than US$298 million that NWM N.V. allegedly received from certain Madoff feeder funds and certain swap counterparties. The claims were previously dismissed, but as a result of an August 2021 decision by the US Court of Appeals, they will now proceed in the bankruptcy court, where they have now been consolidated into one action, subject to NWM N.V.'s legal and factual defences. In May 2022, NWM N.V. filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the consolidated action.\n\n## EUA trading litigation\n\nNWM Plc was a named defendant in civil proceedings before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales brought in 2015 by ten companies (all in liquidation) (the 'Liquidated Companies') and their respective liquidators (together, 'the Claimants'). The Liquidated Companies previously traded in European Union Allowances (EUAs) in 2009 and were alleged to be VAT defaulting traders within (or otherwise connected to) EUA supply chains of which NWM Plc was a party. In March 2020, the court held that NWM Plc and Mercuria Energy Europe Trading Limited ('Mercuria') were liable for dishonestly assisting and knowingly being a party to fraudulent trading during a seven business day period in 2009.\n\nIn October 2020, the High Court quantified total damages against NWM Plc and Mercuria at \u00a345 million plus interest and costs, and permitted the defendants to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In May 2021 the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court's judgment and ordered that a retrial take place before a different High Court judge. The claimants have been denied permission by the Supreme Court to appeal that decision and the retrial will therefore proceed on a date to be scheduled. Mercuria has also been denied permission by the Supreme Court to appeal the High Court's finding that NWM Plc and Mercuria were both vicariously liable.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 26 Memorandum items continued\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\n## Offshoring VAT assessments\n\nHMRC issued protective tax assessments in 2018 against NatWest Group plc totalling \u00a3143 million relating to unpaid VAT in respect of the UK branches of two NatWest Group companies registered in India. NatWest Group formally requested reconsideration by HMRC of their assessments, and this process was completed in November 2020. HMRC upheld their original decision and, as a result, NatWest Group plc lodged an appeal with the Tax Tribunal and an application for judicial review with the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, both in December 2020. In order to lodge the appeal with the Tax Tribunal, NatWest Group plc was required to pay\n\n\u00a3143 million to HMRC, and payment was made in December 2020. The appeal and the application for judicial review have both been stayed pending resolution of a separate case involving another bank.\n\n## US Anti-Terrorism Act litigation\n\nNWM N.V. and certain other financial institutions are defendants in several actions filed by a number of US nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs), most of whom are or were US military personnel, who were killed or injured in attacks in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. NWM Plc is also a defendant in some of these cases.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs' allegations, the defendants are liable for damages arising from the attacks because they allegedly conspired with Iran and certain Iranian banks to assist Iran in transferring money to Hezbollah and the Iraqi terror cells that committed the attacks, in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, by agreeing to engage in 'stripping' of transactions initiated by the Iranian banks so that the Iranian nexus to the transactions would not be detected.\n\nThe first of these actions was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in November 2014. In September 2019, the district court dismissed the case, finding that the claims were deficient for several reasons, including lack of sufficient allegations as to the alleged conspiracy and causation. On 5 January 2023, the US Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's dismissal of this case. Another action, filed in the SDNY in 2017, was dismissed by the SDNY in March 2019 on similar grounds as the first case, but remains subject to appeal to the US Court of Appeals. Other follow-on actions that are substantially similar to the two that have now been dismissed are pending in the same courts.\n\n## 1MDB litigation\n\nA Malaysian court claim was served in Switzerland in November 2022 by 1MDB, a Sovereign Wealth Fund, in which Coutts & Co Ltd was named, along with six others, as a defendant in respect of losses allegedly incurred by 1MDB. It is claimed that Coutts & Co Ltd is liable as a constructive trustee for having dishonestly assisted the directors of 1MDB in the breach of their fiduciary duties by failing (amongst other alleged claims) to undertake due diligence in relation to a customer of Coutts & Co Ltd, through which funds totalling c.US$1 billion were received and paid out between 2009 and 2011. The claimant seeks the return of that amount plus interest. Coutts & Co Ltd filed an application in January 2023 challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court's jurisdiction to hear the claim. Coutts & Co Ltd is a company registered in Switzerland and is in wind-down following the announced sale of its business assets in 2015.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n371\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss  ((iinncclluuddiinngg  iinnvveessttiiggaattiioonnss  aanndd  ccuussttoommeerr r reeddrreessss  pprrooggrraammmmeess))\n\nNatWest Group's businesses and financial condition can be affected by the actions of various governmental and regulatory authorities in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere. NatWest Group has engaged, and will continue to engage, in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities, including in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere, on an ongoing and regular basis, and in response to informal and formal inquiries or investigations, regarding operational, systems and control evaluations and issues including those related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including consumer protection, investment advice, business conduct, competition/anti-trust, VAT recovery, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and sanctions regimes. NatWest Group expects government and regulatory intervention in financial services to be high for the foreseeable future, including increased scrutiny from competition and other regulators in the retail and SME business sectors.\n\nAny matters discussed or identified during such discussions and inquiries may result in, among other things, further inquiry or investigation, other action being taken by governmental and regulatory authorities, increased costs being incurred by NatWest Group, remediation of systems and controls, public or private censure, restriction of NatWest Group's business activities and/or fines. Any of the events or circumstances mentioned in this paragraph or below could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group, its business, authorisations and licences, reputation, results of operations or the price of securities issued by it, or lead to material additional provisions being taken.\n\nNatWest Group is co-operating fully with the matters described below.\n\n## US investigations relating to fixed-income securities\n\nIn December 2021, NWM Plc pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to one count of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud in connection with historical spoofing conduct by former employees in US Treasuries markets between January 2008 and May 2014 and, separately, during approximately three months in 2018. The 2018 trading occurred during the term of a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) between NWMSI and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut (USAO CT), under which non-prosecution was conditioned on NWMSI and affiliated companies not engaging in criminal conduct during the term of the NPA. The relevant trading in 2018 was conducted by two NWM traders in Singapore and breached that NPA. The plea agreement reached with the US Department of Justice and the USAO CT resolved both the spoofing conduct and the breach of the NPA.\n\nAs required by the resolution and sentence imposed by the court, NWM Plc is subject to a three-year period of probation. The plea agreement also imposes an independent corporate monitor. In addition, NWM Plc has committed to compliance programme reviews and improvements and agreed to reporting and co-operation obligations.\n\nOther material adverse collateral consequences may occur as a result of this matter, as further described in the Risk Factors relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on pages 423 to 424.",

Significant events are included in the financial statements either to provide new information about conditions that existed at 31 December 2022, including estimates used to prepare the financial statements (known as an adjusting event) or to provide new information about conditions that did not exist at 31 December 2022 (nonadjusting events). This note provides information relating to material non-adjusting events.\n\nOn 6 February 2023, NWB reached agreement with the trustees of the Main Section of the Group pension scheme to recognise that the final distribution linked contribution to the Main Scheme, of up to \u00a3471 million, in 2023 is not expected to be required. In its  place, agreement was reached to establish a new legal structure to hold assets with a value equivalent to \u00a3471 million. These assets would become transferrable to the Main section in the event that future triggers, reflecting a funding requirement, were met. The assets are not de-recognised from NWB balance sheet but are recorded as encumbered. The Group believes likelihood of triggers being met are remote given the current funding position of the Main section.\n\nOther than as disclosed in the accounts, there have been no other significant events between 31 December 2022 and the date of approval of these accounts which would require a change or additional disclosure.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\n376\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Parent company financial statements and notes\n\nBalance sheet as at 31 December 2022\n\n|                                   | Note   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                            |        |           |           |\n| Derivatives with subsidiaries     |        | 827       | 974       |\n| Amounts due from subsidiaries     | 4      | 25,981    | 29,962    |\n| Other financial assets            |        | -         | 668       |\n| Investments in Group undertakings | 9      | 52,816    | 48,835    |\n| Other assets                      |        | 42        | 38        |\n| Total assets                      |        | 79,666    | 80,477    |\n| Liabilities                       |        |           |           |\n| Amounts due to subsidiaries       | 4      | 30        | 378       |\n| Derivatives                       |        | 1,380     | 704       |\n| Other financial liabilities       |        | 22,229    | 23,600    |\n| Subordinated liabilities          | 8      | 5,820     | 7,740     |\n| Other liabilities                 |        | 95        | 150       |\n| Total liabilities                 |        | 29,554    | 32,572    |\n| Owners' equity                    |        | 50,112    | 47,905    |\n| Total liabilities and equity      |        | 79,666    | 80,477    |\n\nOwners' equity of NWG plc as at 31 December 2022 includes the profit for the year of \u00a38,111 million (2021 - \u00a37,147 million).\n\nAs permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the primary financial statements of the company do not include an income statement or a statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe accompanying notes on pages 380 to 392 form an integral part of these financial statements.\n\nThe accounts were approved by the Board of directors on 16 February 2023 and signed on its behalf by:\n\nHoward Davies Chairman\n\nAlison Rose-Slade DBE Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nKatie Murray Group Chief Financial Officer\n\nNatWest Group plc Registered No. SC45551\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n377",

Presentation of financial statements\n\nThe accounting policies applied to the parent company financial statements are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements except investment in group undertaking (subsidiaries) are stated at cost less impairment  and that it has no policy regarding consolidation.\n\nThe directors have prepared  the financial statements on a going concern basis based on the directors' assessment that the parent company will continue in operational existence for a period of twelve months from the date the financial statements are approved (refer to the Report of the directors).\n\n## 2. Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe reported results of the parent company are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements. The judgments and assumptions involved in the parent company's accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are those involved in assessing the impairment, if any, in its investment in group undertakings, refer to Note 9.\n\n## 3 Derivatives with subsidiaries - designated hedges\n\nFair value hedging is used to hedge loans and other financial liabilities, and cash flow hedging is used to hedge other financial liabilities and subordinated liabilities.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 3.8 and 3.12.\n\nDerivatives held for hedging purposes are as follows:\n\n|                                              | 2022         | 2022      | 2022           | 2021         | 2021      | 2021           |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|\n|                                              | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Fair value hedging -

If any such indication exists, the company undertakes an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of the investment in its Group undertakings with its estimated recoverable amount. The key judgment is in determining the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in its Group undertakings is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, being an assessment of the discounted future cash flows of the entity. Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgments: the five-year cash flow forecast, the choice of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the estimation of fair value.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Note 1.\n\nInvestments in Group undertakings are carried at cost less impairment losses. Movements during the year were as follows:\n\n|                                                | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                   | 48,835    | 46,229    |\n| Additional investments in Group undertakings   | 1,059     | 940       |\n| Disposals of investments in Group undertakings | (1,000)   | (934)     |\n| Net reversal of impairments of investments     | 3,922     | 2,600     |\n| At 31 December                                 | 52,816    | 48,835    |\n\nThe recoverable amount of investments in Group undertakings is the higher of net asset value as a proxy for fair value less cost to sell or value in use. Where recoverable value is based on net asset value, the fair value measurement is categorised as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of Investments in Group undertakings at 31 December 2022 is supported by the respective recoverable values of the entities.\n\nIn May 2022 the company issued \u00a31,000 million of contingent convertible AT1 notes to NWH Ltd and in June 2022 redeemed \u00a3999.9 million of contingent convertible AT1 notes issued to NWH Ltd. In 2022 the company also invested additional capital of \u00a359 million in its subsidiary, RBS AA Holdings.\n\nIn 2022, net reversal of impairments of investments includes a \u00a34,069 million reversal of an earlier impairment of the company's investment in NatWest Holdings Limited as improved five-year cash flow forecasts increased the value in use and a \u00a3147 million impairment of the company's investment in NatWest Markets Plc due to a decline in its net asset value mainly driven by dividends paid during the year and losses incurred by the business. The net reversal of impairments of investments in 2021 was mainly related to NatWest Holdings Limited's impairment reversals.\n\nThe impact of reasonably possible changes to the more significant variables in the value in use calculations for Natwest Holdings Limited are presented below. This reflects the sensitivity of the value in use to each variable on its own. In all cases there is sufficient headroom remaining to absorb changes in the assumptions. It is possible that more than one change may occur at the same time. The value in use calculations use 15.3% as a pre-tax discount rate and 1.4% as a long term growth rate.\n\nThe value in use model shows the following sensitivities:\n\n|                                                              | Potential VIU movement   | Potential VIU movement   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                              | 2022                     | 2021                     |\n|                                                              | \u00a3bn                      | \u00a3bn                      |\n| 1% adverse movement in discount rate                         | (6.0)                    | (4.4)                    |\n| 1% adverse movement in terminal growth rate                  | (3.1)                    | (2.0)                    |\n| \u00a3500 million adverse movement in operating profit before tax | (3.8)                    | (4.3)                    |\n\nThe principal subsidiary undertakings of the company are shown below. Their capital consists of ordinary shares, preference shares and additional Tier 1 notes which are unlisted with the exception of certain preference shares listed by NWB Plc. All of these subsidiaries are included in NatWest Group's consolidated financial statements and have an accounting reference date of 31 December.\n\n|                                                                                                                                    | Nature of business    | Country of incorporation and  principal area of operation   | Group interest   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| National Westminster Bank Plc (1,3)                                                                                                | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (3)                                                                                                 | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| Coutts & Company (2, 3)                                                                                                            | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| Ulster Bank Ireland Designated Activity Company (3)                                                                        Banking |                       | Republic of Ireland                                         | 100%             |\n| NatWest Markets Plc                                                                                                                | Banking               | Great Britain                                               | 100%             |\n| NatWest Markets N.V.

This document contains a number of adjusted or alternative performance measures, also known as non-GAAP or non-IFRS performance measures. These measures are adjusted for notable and other defined items which management believes are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period comparison. The non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include the calculation of metrics that are used throughout the banking industry. These non-IFRS measures are not measures within the scope of IFRS and are not a substitute for IFRS measures.\n\n## 1. Go-forward group\n\nFurther progress with respect to the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland has resulted in Ulster Bank RoI continuing operations no longer meeting the IFRS definition of an operating segment.

NatWest Group return on tangible equity\n\nReturn on tangible equity comprises profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by average tangible equity. Average tangible equity is average total equity excluding average non-controlling interests, average other owners equity and average intangible assets.\n\nGo-forward group return on tangible equity is calculated as profit for the period less Ulster Bank RoI divided by Go-forward group total tangible equity. Go-forward RWAe applying factor is the Go-forward group average RWAe as a percentage of total Natwest Group average RWAe.\n\nThis measure shows the return NatWest Group generates on tangible equity deployed.

Segmental return on equity\n\nSegmental return on equity comprises segmental operating profit or loss, adjusted for preference share dividends, paid-in equity and tax, divided by average notional equity. Average RWAe is defined as average segmental RWAs incorporating the effect of capital deductions. This is multiplied by an allocated equity factor for each segment to calculate the average notional tangible equity.\n\nThis measure shows the return generated by operating segments on equity deployed.\n\n| Year ended 31 December 2022                              | Retail Banking   | Private Banking   | Commercial & Institutional   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| Operating profit (\u00a3m)                                    | 2,824            | 436               | 2,547                        |\n| Paid-in equity cost allocation (\u00a3m)                      | (80)             | (15)              | (187)                        |\n| Adjustment for tax (\u00a3m)                                  | (768)            | (118)             | (590)                        |\n| Adjusted attributable profit (\u00a3m)                        | 1,976            | 303               | 1,770                        |\n| Average RWAe (\u00a3bn)                                       | 53.1             | 11.3              | 104.0                        |\n| Equity factor                                            | 13.0%            | 11.0%             | 14.0%                        |\n| Average notional equity (\u00a3bn)                            | 6.9              | 1.2               | 14.6                         |\n| Return on equity                                         | 28.6%            | 24.5%             | 12.2%                        |\n| Year ended 31 December 2021                              |                  |                   |                              |\n| Operating profit (\u00a3m)                                    | 1,968            | 350               | 2,241                        |\n| Preference share and paid-in equity cost allocation (\u00a3m) | (80)             | (20)              | (236)                        |\n| Adjustment for tax (\u00a3m)                                  | (529)            | (92)              | (501)                        |\n| Adjusted attributable profit (\u00a3m)                        | 1,359            | 238               | 1,504                        |\n| Average RWAe (\u00a3bn)                                       | 36.0             | 11.2              | 106.0                        |\n| Equity factor                                            | 14.5%            | 12.5%             | 13.0%                        |\n| Average notional equity (\u00a3bn)                            | 5.2              | 1.4               | 13.8                         |\n| Return on equity                                         | 26.1%            | 17.0%             | 10.9%                        |\n| Year ended 31 December 2020                              |                  |                   |                              |\n| Operating profit/(loss) (\u00a3m)                             | 849              | 208               | (527)                        |\n| Preference share and paid-in equity cost allocation (\u00a3m) | (88)             | (22)              | (241)                        |\n| Adjustment for tax (\u00a3m)                                  | (213)            | (52)              | 192                          |\n| Adjusted attributable profit/(loss) (\u00a3m)                 | 548              | 134               | (576)                        |\n| Average RWAe (\u00a3bn)                                       | 37.2             | 10.4              | 120.7                        |\n| Equity factor                                            | 14.5%            | 12.5%             | 13.0%                        |\n| Average notional equity (\u00a3bn)                            | 5.4              | 1.3               | 15.7                         |\n| Return on equity                                         | 10.2%            | 10.3%             | (3.7%)                       |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n397",

Bank average interest earning assets are average interest earning assets of the banking business of NatWest Group excluding liquid asset buffer.\n\nLiquid asset buffer consists of assets held by NatWest Group, such as cash and balances at central banks and debt securities in issue, that can be used to ensure repayment of financial obligations as they fall due. The exclusion of liquid asset buffer presents net interest margin on a basis more comparable with UK peers and excludes the impact of regulatory driven factors. .

Loan:deposit ratio\n\nAdjusted loan:deposit ratio is calculated as net customer loans held at amortised cost excluding reverse repos divided by total customer deposits excluding repos. Prior periods have been re-presented. This is a common metric used to assess liquidity. The removal of repos and reverse repos reduces volatility and presents the ratio on a basis that is comparable to UK peers.\n\nA reconciliation is shown below including a comparison to the nearest GAAP measure: loan:deposit ratio. This is calculated as net loans to customers held at amortised cost divided by customer deposits.\n\n|                                                        | As at               | As at               | As at               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                        | 31 December 2022 \u00a3m | 31 December 2021 \u00a3m | 31 December 2020 \u00a3m |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost                    | 366,340             | 358,990             | 360,544             |\n| Less reverse repos                                     | (19,749)            | (25,962)            | (25,011)            |\n|                                                        | 346,591             | 333,028             | 335,533             |\n| Customer deposits                                      | 450,318             | 479,810             | 431,739             |\n| Less repos                                             | (9,828)             | (14,541)            | (5,167)             |\n|                                                        | 440,490             | 465,269             | 426,572             |\n| Loan:deposit ratio (%)                                 | 81%                 | 75%                 | 84%                 |\n| Loan:deposit ratio (excl. repos and reverse repos) (%) | 79%                 | 72%                 | 79%                 |\n\n## 2. Loan impairment rate\n\nLoan impairment rate is the loan impairment charge divided by gross customer loans. This measure is used to assess the credit quality of the loan book.\n\n## 3. Funded assets\n\nFunded assets is calculated as total assets less derivative assets. This measure allows review of balance sheet trends exclusive of the volatility associated with derivative fair values.\n\n## 4. AUMAs\n\nAUMA comprises both assets under management (AUMs) and assets under administration (AUAs) serviced through the Private Banking business segments. AUMs comprise assets where the investment management is undertaken by Private Banking on behalf of Private Banking, Retail Banking and Commercial & Institutional customers. AUAs comprise third party assets held on an execution-only basis in custody by Private Banking, Retail Banking and Commercial & Institutional for their customers, for which the execution services are supported by Private Banking. Private Banking receives a fee for providing investment management and execution services to Retail Banking and Commercial & Institutional business segments.\n\nThis measure is tracked and reported as the amount of funds that we manage or administer directly impacts the level of investment income that we receive.\n\n## 5. Net new money\n\nNet new money refers to client cash inflows and outflows relating to investment products (this can include transfers from saving accounts). Net new money excludes the impact of EEA resident client outflows following the UK's exit from the EU and Russian client outflows since Q1 2022.\n\nNet new money is reported and tracked to monitor the business performance of new business inflows and management of existing client withdrawals across Retail Banking, Private Banking and Commercial & Institutional Banking.\n\n## 6. Wholesale funding\n\nWholesale funding comprises deposits by banks (excluding repos), debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities. Funding risk is the risk of not maintaining a diversified, stable and cost-effective funding base. The disclosure of wholesale funding highlights the extent of our diversification and how we mitigate funding risk.\n\n## 7. Third party rates\n\nThird party customer asset rate is calculated as interest receivable on third-party loans to customers as a percentage of thirdparty loans to customers. This excludes assets of disposal groups, intragroup items, loans to banks and liquid asset portfolios. Third party customer funding rate reflects interest payable or receivable on third-party customer deposits, including interest bearing and non-interest bearing customer deposits. Intragroup items, bank deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are excluded for customer funding rate calculation.\n\nThese metrics help investors better understand our net interest margin and interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThis report has been prepared for NatWest Group to comply with the Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 which implement Article 89 of the Capital Requirements Directive IV.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n400\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## The Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations (Audited)\n\nThis report shows the income, profit/(loss) before tax, tax paid/(received), average and spot employee numbers on a full-time equivalent basis for the entities located in the countries in which we operate.\n\n## Country\n\nEach subsidiary or branch is allocated to the country in which it is resident for tax purposes. The data is consolidated for all the subsidiaries and branches allocated to each country.\n\n## Income and profit/(loss) before tax\n\nIncome and profit/(loss) totals are reported in Note 4 within the Geographical segments table.\n\n## Tax paid/(received)\n\nTax paid/(received) disclosed under CRD IV relates to corporation tax.\n\nCorporation tax paid represents net cash taxes paid to/(received) from the tax authorities in each jurisdiction.\n\nCorporation tax paid is reported on a cash basis as opposed to an accounting basis and therefore does not necessarily have a direct correlation to the reported profits or losses arising in the year. For example, in certain jurisdictions taxable profits may be reduced as a result of the offset of tax losses brought forward from prior years; or tax payments may be calculated with reference to prior year profits.\n\n## Full time equivalent employees (FTEs)\n\nFTEs are allocated to the country in which they are primarily based for the performance of their employment duties. The figures disclosed represent the average number of FTEs, including temporary staff, in each country during the period. The FTEs, including temporary staff, at 31 December 2022, have been added for completeness.\n\n## Public subsidies received\n\nNo public subsidies were received during the period .\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n401",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nSet out below are certain risk factors that could adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, its financial condition and/or prospects and cause them to be materially different from what is forecast or expected, and directly or indirectly impact the value of its securities. These risk factors are broadly categorised and should be read in conjunction with other sections of this annual report, including the forwardlooking statements section, the strategic report and the risk and capital management section. They should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties facing NatWest Group.\n\n## E Eccoonnoommiicc  aanndd  ppoolliittiiccaall  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group, its customers and its counterparties face continued economic and political risks and uncertainties in the UK and global markets, including as a result of high inflation and rising interest rates, supply chain disruption and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNatWest Group is affected by global economic and market conditions. Uncertain and volatile economic conditions can create a challenging operating environment for financial services companies such as NatWest Group. The outlook for the global economy has many uncertainties including: falling economic activity, high inflation, rising interest rates, elevated energy prices and higher cost-of-living, supply chain disruption, changes to monetary and fiscal policy, and the impact of armed conflict (in particular the Russian invasion of Ukraine).\n\nThese conditions, including the current cost-of-living crisis, could be worsened by a number of factors including: instability in the global financial system, market volatility and change, fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling, new or extended economic sanctions, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic volatility in emerging markets, volatility in commodity prices or concerns regarding sovereign debt or sovereign credit ratings.  Economic conditions may also be affected by the changing demographics in the markets that NatWest Group serves, increasing social and other inequalities, or rapid changes to the economic environment due to the adoption of technology, automation and artificial intelligence, or due to climate change, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and/or other sustainability risks.\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nNatWest Group is also exposed to risks arising out of geopolitical events or political developments, such as exchange controls and other measures taken by sovereign governments that may hinder economic or financial activity levels. Unfavourable political, military or diplomatic events, increasing geopolitical tensions leading to armed conflict, protectionist policies or trade barriers, secession movements or the exit of other member states from the EU, changes to monetary and fiscal policy, new and widespread public health crises (including any epidemics or pandemics), state and privately sponsored cyber and terrorist acts or threats, and the responses to each of the above economic, political or other scenarios by various governments and markets, could negatively affect the business and performance of NatWest Group, including as a result of the indirect impact on regional or global trade and/or NatWest Group's customers and counterparties.\n\nThe UK experienced significant political uncertainty in 2022 that may persist into the foreseeable future.  This could lead to a loss of confidence in the UK, that could in turn, negatively impact companies operating in the UK. NatWest Group also faces political uncertainty in Scotland as a result of a possible second Scottish independence referendum. Independence may adversely affect NatWest Group both in relation to entities incorporated in Scotland and in other jurisdictions. Any changes to Scotland's relationship with the UK or the EU may adversely affect the environment in which NatWest Group and its subsidiaries operate and may require further changes to NatWest Group, independently or in conjunction with other mandatory or strategic structural and organisational changes, any of which could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic prompted many changes that may prove to be permanent shifts in customer behaviour and economic activity, such as changes in spending patterns and significantly more people working in a more flexible manner. These changes may affect asset prices, the economic environment, and NatWest Group's customers' and counterparties' financial performance and needs.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks, governments, regulators, and legislatures in the UK and elsewhere offered unprecedented levels of support and various schemes to assist businesses and individuals, many of which have since been curtailed or withdrawn.  However, risks remain as to whether these loans will be repaid.\n\n404\n\nThe value of NatWest Group's own and other securities may be materially affected by market risk, including as a result of market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain of NatWest Group's own and other securities, particularly during periods of market displacement. This could cause a decline in the value of NatWest Group's own and other securities, which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's results of operations in future periods, or inaccurate carrying values for certain financial instruments.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values, which may be accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, increasing NatWest Group's counterparty risk. NatWest Group's risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate NatWest Group's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, market events have historically been difficult to predict, and NatWest Group, its customers and its counterparties could realise significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.\n\nAny of the above may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\n## Changes in interest rates have significantly affected, and will continue to affect, NatWest Group's business and results.\n\nNatWest Group's performance is affected by changes in interest rates. Benchmark overnight interest rates, such as the UK base rate, increased in 2022 and are expected to continue to rise in the shortterm accompanied by quantitative tightening. However, forward rates at 31 December 2022 suggested interest rates may fall again in the medium-term.\n\nStable interest rates support predictable income flow and less volatility in asset and liability valuations, although persistently low and negative interest rates, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, are generally expected to be less favourable for banks.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nFor NatWest Group, persistently low interest rates may reduce the yield on its lower interest income.\n\nVolatility in interest rates may also result in unexpected outcomes both for interest income and asset and liability valuations which may adversely affect NatWest Group. For example, unexpected movements in spreads between key benchmark rates such as sovereign and swap rates in turn affect liquidity portfolio valuations. Finally, sharp unexpected rises in rates may also have negative impacts on some asset and derivative valuations, for example. Any of the above may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nMovements in interest rates also influence and reflect the macroeconomic situation more broadly, affecting factors such as business and consumer confidence, property prices, default rates on loans and other indicators that may indirectly affect NatWest Group and may adversely affect its future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect NatWest Group's results and financial condition.\n\nDecisions of central banks (including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve) and political or market events, which are outside NatWest Group's control, may lead to sharp and sudden fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nAlthough NatWest Group is principally a UK focused banking group, it is subject to structural foreign exchange risk from capital deployed in NatWest Group's foreign subsidiaries, branches and other strategic equity shareholdings. NatWest Group also relies on issuing securities in non-sterling currencies that assist in meeting NatWest Group's MREL. NatWest Group conducts banking activities in non-sterling currencies (for example, loans, deposits and dealing activity) which affects its revenue and also uses service providers based outside of the United Kingdom for certain services and as a result certain operating results are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nNatWest Group maintains policies and procedures designed to manage the impact of exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n405\n\nNevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, particularly in the sterling-US dollar and euro-sterling rates, may adversely affect various factors including, the value of assets, liabilities (including the total amount of MREL-eligible instruments), foreign exchange dealing activity, income and expenses, RWAs and hence the reported earnings and financial condition of NatWest Group.\n\nContinuing uncertainty regarding the effects and extent of the UK's post Brexit divergence from EU laws and regulation, and NatWest Group's post Brexit EU operating model may adversely affect NatWest Group and its operating environment.\n\nThe UK ceased to be a member of the EU and the European Economic Area ('EEA') on 31 January 2020 ('Brexit') and the 2020 EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement ('TCA') ended the transition period on 31 December 2020. The TCA was accompanied by a Joint Declaration on financial services which sets out an intention for the EU and UK to cooperate on matters of financial regulation and to agree a Memorandum of Understanding ('MoU'), which remains unsigned. Certain aspects of the services provided by NatWest Group are therefore subject to obtaining local licences or are subject to individual equivalence decisions (temporary or otherwise) by relevant regulators. The EU's equivalence regime does not cover most lending and deposit taking, and determinations in respect of non-EU countries have not, to date, covered the provision of most financial investment services. In addition, equivalence determinations do not guarantee permanent access rights and can be withdrawn with short notice. In late 2021 the European Commission proposed legislation that would require non-EU firms to establish a branch or subsidiary in the EU before providing 'banking services' in the EU. If these proposals become law all 'banking services' will be licensable activities in each EU member state and member states will not be permitted to offer bilateral permissions to financial institutions outside the EU allowing them to provide 'banking services' in the EU. Uncertainty remains as to whether 'banking services' will also include investment products.\n\nNatWest Group continues to evaluate its post Brexit EU operating model, making adaptations as necessary.\n\nNatWest Group also continues to assess where NatWest Group companies can obtain bilateral regulatory permissions to facilitate intragroup transactions and/or to permit business to continue from its UK entities, transferring what cannot be continued to be rendered from the UK to an EEA subsidiary or branch where permitted or commercially reasonable to do so. Where these regulatory permissions are temporary or are withdrawn, a different approach may need to be taken or may result in a change in operating model or some business being ceased. Not all NatWest Group entities have applied for bilateral regulatory permissions and instead conduct EEA business through an EEA licensed subsidiary or branch. Certain permissions are required in order to maintain the ability to clear euro payments. Other permissions, including the ability to have two intermediate EU parent undertakings, may need to be obtained, and structural changes may need to be made, to allow NatWest Group to continue to serve EEA customers from both the ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced banking entities. Any failure to obtain such permissions or make such structural changes in a timely manner, or at all, could adversely affect NatWest Group and the EEA customers it serves. Furthermore, transferring business to an EEA based subsidiary is a complex exercise and involves legal, regulatory and execution risks, and could result in a loss of business and/or customers or higher than anticipated costs. The changes to NatWest Group's operating model have been costly and failure to receive the requested regulatory permissions and/or further changes to its business operations, product offering and customer engagement could result in further costs and/or regulatory sanction.\n\nThe long-term effects of Brexit and the uncertainty regarding NatWest Group's EU operating model may adversely affect NatWest Group and its customers and counterparties who are themselves dependent on trading with the EU or personnel from the EU. The long-term effects of Brexit may also be exacerbated by wider UK and global macroeconomic trends and events.\n\nUncertainties remain as to the extent to which EU/EEA laws will diverge from UK law.\n\nRISK\n\nAND\n\nCAPITAL\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "For example, bank regulation in the UK may diverge from European bank regulation if the Financial Services and Markets Bill ('FSM') is enacted into law. The UK government has also proposed legislation to introduce automatic 'sunset' clauses for retained EU law by the end of 2023 (the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022), which if enacted could potentially cause market disruption and require additional resources to manage the legal and regulatory consequences. NatWest Group may not be able to respond to these changes effectively, in a timely manner, or at all. The actions taken by regulators in response to any new or revised bank regulation and other rules affecting financial services, may adversely affect NatWest Group, including its business, non-UK operations, group structure, compliance costs, intragroup arrangements and capital requirements.\n\nHM Treasury (or UKGI on its behalf) could exercise a significant degree of influence over NatWest Group and further offers or sales of NatWest Group's shares held by HM Treasury may affect the price of NatWest Group securities.\n\nIn its March 2021 Budget, the UK Government announced its intention to carry out a programme of sales of NatWest Group plc ordinary shares with the objective of selling all of its remaining shares in NatWest Group plc by 2026. NatWest Group plc has: (i) carried out directed buybacks of NatWest Group plc ordinary shares from UK Government Investments Limited ('UKGI') in March 2021 and in March 2022, (ii) carried out sales of NatWest Group plc shares by UKGI by accelerated bookbuild in May 2021 and (iii) made purchases under NatWest Group plc's directed and onmarket buyback programmes announced in July 2021 and in March 2022. As at 17 January 2023, the UK Government held 44.98% of the ordinary share capital with voting rights of NatWest Group plc. NatWest Group may participate in similar directed or onmarket buybacks in the near- and medium-term future. The precise timing and extent of further UKGI's sell-downs is uncertain, which could result in a prolonged period of price volatility for NatWest Group plc's ordinary shares and other securities.\n\nAny offers or sales of a substantial number of ordinary shares in NatWest Group plc by UKGI, market expectations about these sales and any associated directed, on or off market buyback activity by NatWest Group, could affect the prevailing market price for the outstanding ordinary shares of NatWest\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nGroup plc which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group.\n\nHM Treasury has indicated that it intends to respect the commercial decisions of NatWest Group and that NatWest Group will continue to have its own independent board of directors and management team determining its own strategy. However, for as long as HM Treasury remains NatWest Group plc's largest single shareholder, HM Treasury and UKGI (as manager of HM Treasury's shareholding) could exercise a significant degree of influence over NatWest Group including: the election of directors and appointment of senior management, NatWest Group's capital strategy, dividend policy, remuneration policy or the conduct of NatWest Group's operations. HM Treasury or UKGI's approach depends on government policy, which could change.\n\nThe manner in which HM Treasury or UKGI exercises HM Treasury's rights as NatWest Group's largest single shareholder could give rise to conflicts between the interests of HM Treasury and the interests of other shareholders, including as a result of a change in government policy, which may in turn adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\n## S Sttrraatteeggiicc  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes.\n\nNatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which is designed to champion potential and to help individuals, families and businesses to thrive. NatWest Group's strategy is intended to reflect the rapidly shifting environment and backdrop of unprecedented disruption in society driven by technology and changing customer expectations, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, shifting trends include digitalisation, decarbonisation, automation, ecommerce and hybrid working, each of which has resulted in significant market volatility and change. There is also increased investor, employee, stakeholder, regulatory and customer scrutiny regarding how businesses address these changes and related climate change, biodiversity and other sustainability issues, including tackling inequality, working conditions, workplace health, safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, data protection and management, workforce management, human rights and supply chain management.\n\n406\n\nIn recent years, as part of its purpose-led strategy, NatWest Group has refocused its NatWest Markets business, and has also created the Commercial & Institutional business segments. The Commercial & Institutional business segment combined the pre-existing Commercial, NatWest Markets and RBS International businesses to form a single business segment, which focuses on serving Commercial & Institutional customers. The Commercial & Institutional business segment is intended to allow closer operational and strategic alignment to support growth, with increased levels of services being provided between NatWest Group entities, with the potential increased risk of breach of the UK ring-fencing regime requiring effective conflicts of interest policies.\n\nMany factors may adversely impact the successful implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy, including:\n\n- \uf02d macroeconomic challenges including rising inflation and interest rates and falling economic activity which may adversely affect economic growth and which could in turn impact certain strategic initiatives and new venture opportunities for NatWest Group;\n- \uf02d an internal culture shift across NatWest Group as to how NatWest Group conducts its business to strive towards NatWest Group's One Bank strategy;\n- \uf02d maintaining effective governance, procedures, systems and controls giving effect to the purpose-led strategy whilst also managing emerging climate, ESG and other sustainability-related risks and opportunities;\n- \uf02d achieving a number of financial, capital and operational targets and expectations, both for the short term and throughout the implementation period;\n- \uf02d cost-controlling measures, which may result in material one-off provisions to lower the NatWest Group cost base, may divert investment from other areas, and may vary considerably from year to year;\n- \uf02d lower customer confidence and confidence from the wider market, which may result in a decrease of customer activity and related income levels;\n- \uf02d changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment in which NatWest Group, its customers and its counterparties operate, regulatory uncertainty and changes, strong market competition and industry disruption and economic volatility; and\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n- \uf02d any economic downturn which may adversely affect the strategy as certain initiatives depend on achieving growth in new ventures and opportunities for NatWest Group.\n\nIn pursuing its purpose-led strategy, NatWest Group may not be able to successfully: (i) implement some or all aspects of its strategy; (ii) meet any or all of the related targets or expectations of its strategy; or (iii) realise the intended strategic objectives of any other future strategic or growth initiative. The scale and scope of its strategy and the intended changes continue to present material business, operational and regulatory (including compliance with the UK ring-fencing regime), conflicts, legal, execution, IT system, internal culture, conduct and people risks to NatWest Group. Implementing many changes and strategic actions concurrently, including in respect of any growth initiatives, will require application of robust governance and controls frameworks and robust IT systems; there is a risk that NatWest Group may not be successful in these respects. The implementation of the purpose-led strategy and any other strategic initiatives could result in materially higher costs than initially contemplated (including due to material uncertainties and factors outside of NatWest Group's control) and may not be completed as planned, or at all, or could be phased or could progress in a manner other than currently expected. This could lead to additional management actions by NatWest Group.\n\nEach of these risks, and others identified in these Risk Factors, individually or collectively could jeopardise the implementation and delivery of the purpose-led strategy and other strategic initiatives, result in higher than expected costs, impact NatWest Group's products and services offering, its reputation with customers or business model and adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to deliver its strategy and meet its targets and guidance, each of which could adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nFuture acquisitions or divestments by NatWest Group may not be successful, and consolidation or fragmentation of the financial services industry may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nThe financial services industry is experiencing continued competitive pressure with technological advancement disrupting traditional business models. In order to compete effectively,\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n407\n\nNatWest Group may decide, as part of its purpose-led strategy, to undertake divestments, restructurings or reorganisations.\n\nConversely, it may decide to grow its business through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and/or strategic partnerships as well as other transactions and initiatives to: (i) enhance capabilities that may lead to better productivity or cost efficiencies; (ii) acquire talent; (iii) pursue new products or expand existing products; or (iv) enter new markets or enhance its presence in existing markets.\n\nThere are risks that NatWest Group may not fully realise the expected benefits and value from these transactions and initiatives in the time, or to the degree, anticipated, or at all. In particular, NatWest Group may: (i) fail to realise the business rationale for the transaction or initiative, or assumptions underlying the business plans supporting the valuation of a target business may prove inaccurate, for example, regarding synergies and expected commercial demand; (ii) fail to successfully integrate any acquired businesses (including in respect of technologies, existing strategies, products and human capital) or to successfully divest or restructure a business; (iii) fail to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of any acquired or restructured business; (iv) be required or wish to terminate pre-existing contractual relationships, which could prove costly and/or be executed at unfavourable terms and conditions; (v) fail to discover certain contingent or undisclosed liabilities in businesses that it acquires, or its due diligence to discover any such liabilities may be inadequate; and (vi) not obtain necessary regulatory and other approvals or onerous conditions may be attached to such approvals. Accordingly, NatWest Group may not be successful in growing its business through divestments, restructurings, reorganisations or acquisitions, and initiatives and any particular transaction may not succeed, may be limited in scope or scale (including due to NatWest Group's current ownership structure) and may not conclude on the terms contemplated, or at all. Any of the above may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nContinued competitive pressure in the financial services industry, including from technology companies, may have a negative impact on NatWest Group's business. If NatWest Group Commercial & Institutional customers merge or are acquired by other entities that are not NatWest Group customers,\n\nthis may also lead to losses for NatWest Group. Existing larger banks or financial institutions (and those that emerge from mergers and consolidations) may have more bargaining power in negotiations than NatWest Group. Each of these developments may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland present various risks.\n\nNatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI continues to present significant commercial, operational, reputational, legal and execution risks. In particular, the phased withdrawal from ROI requires transfers of business, assets and liabilities to third parties, and entails many risks, the most significant of which include: (i) anticipated reductions in net income, total lending and RWAs; (ii) potential stranded capital or an inability to return capital from Ulster Bank Ireland DAC to its parent; (iii) the diversion of management resources and attention away from day-to-day management; (iv) the recognition of disposal losses as part of the orderly run-down of certain loan portfolios which may be higher than anticipated; (v) execution risks arising from the significant uncertainties of a phased withdrawal, including the additional IT and operational expense and resource required to mitigate manual and limited customer switching and handling processes of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, potential counterparties and other banks; (vi) customer action or inaction, or the inability to obtain necessary approvals and/or support from governmental authorities, regulators, trade unions and/or other stakeholders resulting in additional cost, resource and delays; (vii) potential loss of customers, resulting in, for example, retail and commercial deposit outflows and reduced revenues and liquidity; (viii) increased people risk through the potential loss of key colleagues and institutional knowledge and increased challenges of attracting and retaining colleagues; (ix) regulatory risk, including in relation to prudential, conduct and other regulatory requirements; (x) no or limited access to Euro system funding arrangements; and (xi) brand and reputational risks and stakeholder scrutiny about the phased withdrawal from ROI. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cost more, be more complex or harder to mitigate than currently estimated and may adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects or its ability to execute a phased withdrawal from ROI.\n\nAdd\n\nit\n\nion\n\nal i\n\nnform\n\na\n\ntio\n\nn",

The timing, success and quantum of any of these transfers remain uncertain as is the impact of these transactions on its results of operations. As a result, NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects may be adversely affected.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  rreessiilliieennccee  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group may not meet the targets it communicates or be in a position to continue to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs part of NatWest Group's strategy, it has set a number of financial, capital and operational targets including in respect of its: CET1 ratio target, MREL targets, return on tangible equity ('ROTE'), funding plans and requirements, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion as well as ESG (including climate and sustainable funding and financing targets) and customer satisfaction targets and discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders). See also, ' NatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes. '\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its targets, including its CET1 ratio target, and make discretionary capital distributions and to successfully fulfil its strategy is subject to various internal and external factors and risks. These include but are not limited to: UK and global macroeconomic, political, market and regulatory uncertainties, operational risks and risks relating to NatWest Group's business model and strategy (including risks associated with climate, ESG and other sustainability-related issues) and litigation, governmental actions, investigations and regulatory matters.\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nSee also, ' ' NatWest Group, its customers and its counterparties face continued economic and political risks and uncertainties in the UK and global markets, including as a result of high inflation and rising interest rates, supply chain disruption and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ' '\n\nNatWest Group operates in markets that are highly competitive, with increasing competitive pressures and technology disruption.\n\nThe markets within which NatWest Group operates are highly competitive. NatWest Group expects such competition to continue and intensify in response to various changes. These include: evolving customer behaviour, technological changes (including digital currencies and other instruments, stablecoins and the growth of digital banking, such as from fintech entrants), competitor behaviour, new entrants to the market (including non-traditional financial services providers such as retail or technology conglomerates, who may have competitive advantages in scale, technology and customer engagement), competitive foreign-exchange offerings, industry trends resulting in increased disaggregation or unbundling of financial services or conversely the reintermediation of traditional banking services, and the impact of regulatory actions and other factors. In particular, developments in the financial sector resulting from new banking, lending and payment solutions offered by rapidly evolving incumbents, challengers and new entrants, notably with respect to payment services and products, and the introduction of disruptive technology may impede NatWest Group's ability to grow or retain its share and impact its revenues and profitability, particularly in its key UK retail and commercial banking segments. Moreover, innovations such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, automation, the cloud, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing may rapidly facilitate industry transformation.\n\nThese trends have been catalysed by various regulatory and competition policy interventions, including the UK initiative on Open Banking (PSD2), 'Open Finance' and other remedies imposed by the Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA'), which are designed to further promote competition within retail banking. The competition enhancing measures under NatWest Group's independently administered Alternative Remedies Package ('ARP') benefits grant recipients and eligible competitors.\n\n408\n\nThe ARP may be more costly than anticipated and may adversely affect customer service for NatWest Group's own customers, its competitive position and reputation. Failure to comply with the terms of the scheme could result in the imposition of additional measures or limitations on NatWest Group's operations, additional supervision by NatWest Group's regulators, and loss of investor confidence.\n\nIncreasingly, many of the products and services offered by NatWest Group are, and will become, more technology intensive, including through digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence. For example, NatWest Group has invested in a number of fintech ventures, including Mettle, FreeAgent, Tyl, Rapid Cash, Rooster Money and Vodeno. NatWest Group's ability to develop or acquire such digital solutions (which also need to comply with applicable and evolving regulations) has become increasingly important to retaining and growing NatWest Group's customer business in the UK. There can be no certainty that NatWest Group's innovation strategy (which includes investment in its IT capability intended to address the material increase in customer use of online and mobile technology for banking as well as selective acquisitions, which carry associated risks) will be successful or that it will allow NatWest Group to continue to maintain or grow such services in the future. Certain of NatWest Group's current or future competitors may be more successful in implementing innovative technologies for delivering products or services to their customers. NatWest Group may also fail to identify future opportunities or derive benefits from disruptive technologies in the context of rapid technological innovation, changing customer behaviour and growing regulatory demands, resulting in increased competition from traditional banking businesses as well as new providers of financial services, including technology companies with strong brand recognition, that may be able to develop financial services at a lower cost base.\n\nNatWest Group's competitors may also be better able to attract and retain customers and key employees, may have more advanced IT systems, and may have access to lower cost funding and/or be able to attract deposits on more favourable terms than NatWest Group. Although NatWest Group invests in new technologies and participates in industry and research led initiatives aimed at developing new technologies, such investments may be insufficient or ineffective, especially given NatWest Group's focus on cost efficiencies.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk factors continued\n\nThis may limit additional investment in areas such as innovation and could affect NatWest Group's offering of innovative products or technologies for delivering products or services to customers and its competitive position.\n\nFurthermore, the development of innovative products depends on NatWest Group's ability to produce underlying high-quality data, failing which its ability to offer innovative products may be compromised.\n\nIf NatWest Group is unable to offer competitive, attractive and innovative products that are also profitable and timely, it will lose share, incur losses on some or all of its initiatives and lose opportunities for growth. In this context, NatWest Group is investing in the automation of certain solutions and interactions within its customer-facing businesses, including through automation and artificial intelligence. Such initiatives may result in operational, reputational and conduct risks if the technology used is defective, inadequate or is not fully integrated into NatWest Group's current solutions. There can be no certainty that such initiatives will deliver the expected cost savings and investment in automated processes will likely also result in increased short-term costs for NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy (including in relation to acquisitions, reorganisations and/or partnerships), delivery on its climate ambition, costcontrolling measures, as well as employee remuneration constraints, may also have an impact on its ability to compete effectively and intensified competition from incumbents, challengers and new entrants could affect NatWest Group's ability to maintain satisfactory returns. Moreover, activist investors have increasingly become engaged and interventionist in recent years, which may pose a threat to NatWest Group's strategic initiatives. Furthermore, continued consolidation or technological or other developments in certain sectors of the financial services industry could result in NatWest Group's remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, including the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or the emergence of new competitors. Any of the above may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n409\n\n## NatWest Group has significant exposure to counterparty and borrower risk.\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to many different industries, customers and counterparties, and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and the recoverability of monies due from borrowers and other counterparties are inherent in a wide range of NatWest Group's businesses. NatWest Group's lending strategy and associated processes/systems may fail to identify, anticipate or quickly react to weaknesses or risks in a particular sector, market or borrower, or NatWest Group's credit risk appetite relative to competitors, or fail to adequately value physical or financial collateral. This may result in increased default rates or a higher loss given default for loans, which may, in turn, impact NatWest Group's profitability. See also, ' Risk and capital management - Credit Risk '.\n\nThe credit quality of NatWest Group's borrowers and other counterparties may be affected by the recent UK and global macroeconomic and political uncertainties and a further deterioration in prevailing economic and market conditions (including a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other new health crises) and by the legal and regulatory landscape in the UK and countries where NatWest Group is exposed to credit risk. Any further deterioration in these conditions or changes to legal or regulatory landscapes could worsen borrower and counterparty credit quality or impact the enforcement of contractual rights over security, increasing credit risk.\n\nAn increase in drawings upon credit facilities may also increase NatWest Group's RWAs. In addition, the level of household indebtedness in the UK remains high. The ability of households to service their debts could be worsened by a period of high unemployment, increasing interest rates or higher inflation, particularly if prolonged. NatWest Group may be affected by volatility in property prices (including as a result of the general UK political or economic climate) given that NatWest Group's mortgage loan and wholesale property loan portfolios as at 31 December 2022, amounted to \u00a3235.5 billion, representing 62% of NatWest Group's total customer loan exposure. If property prices were to weaken this could lead to higher impairment charges, particularly if default rates also increase. In addition, NatWest Group's credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral that it holds cannot be realised as a result of market conditions or regulatory intervention or if it is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the net amount after accounting for any IFRS 9 provisions already made.\n\nThis is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity or depressed asset valuations.\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to the financial industry, including sovereign debt securities, banks, financial intermediation providers (including providing facilities to financial sponsors and funds, backed by assets or investor commitments) and securitised products (typically senior lending to special purpose vehicles backed by pools of financial assets). Concerns about, or a default by, a financial institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related and interdependent as a result of credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Any perceived lack of creditworthiness of a counterparty or borrower may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses for NatWest Group. This systemic risk may also adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which NatWest Group interacts on a daily basis. See also, ' NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding '.\n\nAs a result, adverse changes in borrower and counterparty credit risk may cause accelerated impairment charges under IFRS 9, increased repurchase demands, higher costs, additional write-downs and losses for NatWest Group and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions.\n\nNatWest Group has applied an internal analysis of multiple economic scenarios (MES) together with the determination of specific overlay adjustments to inform its IFRS 9 ECL (Expected Credit Loss). The recognition and measurement of ECL is complex and involves the use of significant judgment and estimation. This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic scenarios into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate. Going forward, NatWest Group anticipates observable credit deterioration of a proportion of assets resulting in a systematic uplift in defaults, which is mitigated by those economic assumption scenarios being reflected in the Stage 2 ECL across portfolios, along with a combination of post model overlays in both wholesale and retail portfolios reflecting the uncertainty of credit outcomes. See also, ' Risk and capital management - Credit Risk '. A credit deterioration would also lead to RWA increases.",

NatWest Group is required to identify and monitor its exposure to shadow banking entities, implement and maintain an internal framework for the identification, management, control and mitigation of the risks associated with exposure to shadow banking entities, and ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of such exposure. If NatWest Group is unable to properly identify and monitor its shadow banking exposure, maintain an adequate framework, or ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of shadow banking exposure, this may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nIn line with certain mandated COVID-19 pandemic support schemes, NatWest Group assisted affected customers with a number of initiatives including NatWest Group's participation in BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS products. NatWest Group has sought to manage the risks of fraud and money laundering against the need for the fast and efficient release of funds to customers and businesses. NatWest Group may be exposed to fraud, conduct and litigation risks arising from inappropriate approval (or denial) of BBLS, CBILS or CLBILS or the enforcing or pursuing repayment of BBLS,CBILS and CLBILS (or a failure to exercise forbearance), which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation and results of operations. The implementation of the initiatives and efforts mentioned above may result in litigation, regulatory and government actions and proceedings. These actions may result in judgments, settlements, penalties or fines.\n\nIf NatWest Group experiences losses and a reduction in future profitability, this is likely to affect the recoverable value of fixed assets, including goodwill and deferred taxes, which may lead to writedowns.\n\nNatWest Group may not meet the prudential regulatory requirements for regulatory capital and MREL, or manage its capital effectively, which could trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options . .\n\nNatWest Group is required by regulators in the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which it undertakes regulated\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nactivities to maintain adequate financial resources.\n\nAdequate capital provides NatWest Group with financial flexibility specifically in its core UK operations in the face of turbulence and uncertainty in the UK and the global economy. It also permits NatWest Group plc to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio was 14.2% and is targeting a CET1 ratio of 13-14% by the end of 2023. NatWest Group plc's target CET1 ratio is based on a combination of its expected regulatory requirements and internal modelling, including stress scenarios and management's and/or the Prudential Regulation Authority's ('PRA') views on appropriate buffers above minimum operating levels.\n\nNatWest Group plc's current capital strategy is based on the expected accumulation of additional capital through the accrual of profits over time, planned capital actions (including issuances, redemptions, and discretionary capital distributions), RWA growth in the form of regulatory uplifts and lending growth and other capital management initiatives which focus on improving capital efficiency and ensuring NatWest Group meets its medium-tolong term targets. NatWest Group intends to make capital distributions to its equity investors of amounts surplus to its publicly stated CET1 target, subject to macroeconomic conditions, via a combination of dividends and buybacks. In making distribution decisions, consideration is given to previously guided ordinary dividend pay-out ratios, an intention to minimise the government's stake in the Group, and maximising shareholder value.\n\nA number of factors may impact NatWest Group plc's ability to maintain its current CET1 ratio target and achieve its capital strategy. These include:\n\n- \uf02d a depletion of its capital resources through increased costs or liabilities or reduced profits;\n- \uf02d an increase in the quantum of RWAs/Leverage Exposure in excess of that expected, including due to regulatory changes, or a failure in internal controls or procedures to accurately measure and report RWAs/ Leverage Exposure;\n- \uf02d changes in prudential regulatory requirements including NatWest Group plc's Total Capital Requirement/ Leverage Requirement set by the PRA, including Pillar 2 requirements, as applicable, and regulatory buffers as well as any applicable scalars; and\n\n410\n\n- \uf02d reduced dividends from NatWest Group's subsidiaries because of changes in their financial performance and/or the extent to which local capital requirements exceed NatWest Group plc's target ratio; and limitations on the use of double leverage (i.e., NatWest Group plc's use of debt to invest in the equity of its subsidiaries, as a result of the Bank of England's and/or NatWest Group's evolving views on distribution of capital within groups).\n\nA shortage of capital could in turn affect NatWest Group plc's capital ratio, and/or its ability to make capital distributions and in turn NatWest Group may not remain a viable, competitive or profitable banking business.\n\nA minimum level of capital is required to be met by NatWest Group plc for it to be entitled to make certain discretionary payments, and institutions which fail to meet the combined buffer requirement are subject to restricted discretionary payments. The resulting restrictions are scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or discretionary payment which gives rise to a maximum distributable amount (MDA) (if any) that the financial institution can distribute through discretionary payments. Any breach of the combined buffer requirement may necessitate for NatWest Group plc reducing or ceasing discretionary payments (including payments of dividends to shareholders) to the extent of the breach.\n\nNatWest Group plc is required to maintain a set quantum of MREL set as the higher of its RWAs or leverage requirement. The Bank of England has identified single point-of-entry at NatWest Group plc, as the preferred resolution strategy for NatWest Group. As a result, NatWest Group plc is the only entity within NatWest Group that can externally issue securities that count towards its MREL, the proceeds of which can then be downstreamed to meet the internal MREL of its operating entities and intermediate holding companies.\n\nIf NatWest Group plc is unable to raise the requisite amount of regulatory capital or MREL, downstream the proceeds of MREL to subsidiaries as required, or to otherwise meet its regulatory capital,\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nMREL and leverage requirements, it may be exposed to increased regulatory supervision or sanctions, loss of investor confidence, constrained or more expensive funding and be unable to make dividend payments on its ordinary shares or maintain discretionary payments on capital instruments.\n\nIf, under a stress scenario, the level of regulatory capital or MREL falls outside of risk appetite, there are a range of recovery management actions (focused on risk reduction and mitigation) that NatWest Group could take to manage its capital levels, but any such actions may not be sufficient to restore adequate capital levels. Under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directives I and II ('BRRD'), as implemented in the UK, NatWest Group must maintain a recovery plan acceptable to its regulator, such that a breach of NatWest Group's applicable capital or leverage requirements may trigger the application of NatWest Group's recovery plan to remediate a deficient capital position. NatWest Group's regulator may request that NatWest Group carry out certain capital management actions or, if NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio falls below 7%, certain regulatory capital instruments issued by NatWest Group plc will be written-down or converted into equity and there may be an issue of additional equity by NatWest Group plc, which could result in the reduction in value of the holdings of NatWest Group plc's existing shareholders. The success of such issuances will also be dependent on favourable market conditions and NatWest Group may not be able to raise the amount of capital required on acceptable terms or at all. Separately, NatWest Group may address a shortage of capital by taking action to reduce leverage exposure and/or RWAs via asset or business disposals. These actions may, in turn, affect: NatWest Group's product offering, credit ratings, ability to operate its businesses, pursue its current strategies and pursue strategic opportunities, any of which may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects. See also, ' ' NatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, for example, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities. ' '\n\n## NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding.\n\nNatWest Group is required to access sources of liquidity and funding through retail and wholesale deposits, as well as through the debt capital markets.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n411\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc subsidiaries held \u00a3470.7 billion in deposits. The level of deposits may fluctuate due to factors outside NatWest Group's control, such as a loss of customers and/or investor confidence (including in individual NatWest Group entities), changes in interest rates, government support, increasing competitive pressures for retail and corporate customer deposits or the reduction or cessation of deposits by wholesale depositors, which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time. An inability to grow or any material decrease in NatWest Group's deposits could, particularly if accompanied by one of the other factors described above, may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to satisfy its liquidity or funding needs. In turn, this could require NatWest Group to adapt its funding plans or change its operations.\n\nCurrent economic uncertainties and any significant market volatility could affect NatWest Group's ability to access sources of liquidity and funding, which may result in higher funding costs and failure to comply with regulatory capital, funding and leverage requirements. As a result, NatWest Group and its subsidiaries could be required to adapt their funding plans. This could exacerbate funding and liquidity risk, which may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, NatWest Group plc's liquidity coverage ratio was 145%. If its liquidity position were to come under stress, and if NatWest Group plc were unable to raise funds through deposits or in the debt capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, its liquidity position could be adversely affected and it might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to meet its obligations under committed financing facilities, to comply with regulatory funding requirements, to undertake certain capital and/or debt management activities, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. NatWest Group may need to liquidate assets to meet its liabilities, including disposals of assets not previously identified for disposal to reduce its funding commitments or trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options. In a time of reduced liquidity, NatWest Group may be unable to sell some of its assets, or may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nAny reduction in the credit rating and/or outlooks assigned to NatWest Group plc, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective debt securities could adversely affect the availability of funding for NatWest Group, reduce NatWest Group's liquidity position and increase the cost of funding.\n\nRating agencies regularly review NatWest Group plc and other NatWest Group entity credit ratings and outlooks. In October 2022, Moody's changed the outlook from stable to negative for NatWest Bank Plc's issuer rating. NatWest Group entity credit ratings and outlooks could be negatively affected (directly or indirectly) by a number of factors that can change over time, including: credit rating agencies' assessment of NatWest Group's strategy and management's capability; its financial condition including in respect of profitability, asset quality, capital, funding and liquidity; the level of political support for the industries and regions in which NatWest Group operates; the implementation of structural reform; the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to NatWest Group's legal structure; business activities and the rights of its creditors; changes in rating methodologies; changes in the relative size of the loss-absorbing buffers protecting bondholders and depositors; the competitive environment, political and economic conditions in NatWest Group's key markets (including higher interest rates and inflation, supply chain disruptions and the outcome of any further Scottish independence referendum); any reduction of the UK's sovereign credit rating (currently on negative outlook by Moody's, S&P and Fitch) and market uncertainty. In addition, credit ratings agencies are increasingly taking into account sustainability-related factors, including climate, environmental, social and governance related risk, as part of the credit ratings analysis, as are investors in their investment decisions. See also, ' A reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and on investors' risk appetite and customers' willingness to deal with NatWest Group .'\n\nAny reductions in the credit ratings of NatWest Group plc or of certain other NatWest Group entities, including, in particular, downgrades below investment grade, or a deterioration in the capital markets' perception of NatWest Group's financial resilience could significantly affect NatWest Group's access to capital markets, reduce the size of its deposit base and trigger additional collateral or other requirements in its funding arrangements or the need to amend such arrangements, which could adversely affect NatWest Group's (and,",

This may in turn adversely affect NatWest Group's competitive position and threaten its prospects in the short to medium-term.\n\n## NatWest Group may be adversely affected if it fails to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to annual stress tests by its regulator in the UK. Stress tests are designed to assess the resilience of banks to potential adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. If the stress tests reveal that a bank's existing regulatory capital buffers are not sufficient to absorb the impact of the stress, then it is possible that NatWest Group will need to take action to strengthen its capital position.\n\nFailure by NatWest Group to meet the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the stress tests as set forth by its UK regulator may result in: NatWest Group's regulators requiring NatWest Group to generate additional capital, reputational damage, increased supervision and/or regulatory sanctions, restrictions on capital distributions and loss of investor confidence, all of which may adversely affect its future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nNatWest Group could incur losses or be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of limitations or failure of various models.\n\nGiven the complexity of NatWest Group's business, strategy and capital requirements, NatWest Group relies on analytical and other models for a wide range of purposes, including to manage its business, assess the value of its assets and its risk exposure, as well as to anticipate capital and funding requirements (including to facilitate NatWest Group's mandated stress testing). Uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic has made reliance on analytical models and planning and forecasting for NatWest Group more complex, and may result in uncertainty impacting the risk profile of NatWest Group and/or that of the wider banking industry.\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group utilises models for valuations, credit approvals, calculation of loan impairment charges on an IFRS 9 basis, financial reporting and for financial crime (criminal activities in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, tax evasion and sanctions as well as fraud risk management (collectively, 'financial crime')). NatWest Group's models, and the parameters and assumptions on which they are based, are periodically reviewed.\n\nAs models analyse scenarios based on assumed inputs and a conceptual approach, model outputs therefore remain uncertain. Failure of models (including due to errors in model design) or new data inputs (including nonrepresentative data sets), for example, to accurately reflect changes in the micro and macroeconomic environment in which NatWest Group operates (for example to account for high inflation), to capture risks and exposures at the subsidiary level and to update for changes to NatWest Group's current business model or operations, or for findings of deficiencies by NatWest Group's regulators (including as part of NatWest Group's mandated stress testing), may render some business lines uneconomic, result in increased capital requirements, may require management action or may subject NatWest Group to regulatory sanction. NatWest Group may also face adverse consequences as a result of actions based on models that are poorly developed, implemented or used, models that are based on inaccurate or compromised data or as a result of the modelled outcome being misunderstood, or by such information being used for purposes for which it was not designed.\n\n## NatWest Group's financial statements are sensitive to underlying accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, exposures and RWAs. While estimates, judgments and assumptions take into account historical experience and other factors, (including market practice and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances), actual results may differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, judgments and assumptions (particularly those involving the use of complex models).\n\n412\n\nFurther, accounting policy and financial statement reporting requirements are likely to increasingly require management to adjust existing judgments, estimates and assumptions for the effects of climate-related, sustainability and other matters that are inherently uncertain and for which there is little historical experience which may affect the comparability of NatWest Group's future financial results with its historical results. Actual results may differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making climate-related and sustainability estimates, judgments and assumptions.\n\nAccounting policies deemed critical to NatWest Group's results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, involve a high degree of uncertainty and may have a material impact on its results. For 2022, these include loan impairments, fair value, deferred tax and conduct and litigation provisions. These are set out in ' Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty '.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards may materially impact NatWest Group's financial results.\n\nNatWest Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting standards or guidance by accounting bodies or in the timing of their implementation, whether immediate or foreseeable, could result in NatWest Group having to recognise additional liabilities on its balance sheet, or in further write-downs or impairments to its assets and could also significantly impact the financial results, condition and prospects of NatWest Group. From time to time, the International Accounting Standards Board may issue new accounting standards or interpretations that could materially impact how NatWest Group calculates, reports and discloses its financial results and financial condition, and which may affect NatWest Group capital ratios, including the CET1 ratio. New accounting standards and interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but which have not yet been adopted by NatWest Group are discussed in ' Future accounting developments '.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe value or effectiveness of any credit protection that NatWest Group has purchased depends on the value of the underlying assets and the financial condition of the insurers and counterparties.\n\nNatWest Group has some remaining credit exposure arising from over-thecounter derivative contracts, mainly credit default swaps (CDSs), and other credit derivatives, each of which are carried at fair value. The fair value of these CDSs, as well as NatWest Group's exposure to the risk of default by the underlying counterparties, depends on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the instrument against which protection has been bought. Many market counterparties have been adversely affected by their exposure to residential mortgage-linked and corporate credit products, whether synthetic or otherwise, and their actual and perceived creditworthiness may deteriorate rapidly. If the financial condition of these counterparties or their actual or perceived creditworthiness deteriorates, NatWest Group may record further credit valuation adjustments on the credit protection bought from these counterparties under the CDSs. NatWest Group also recognises any fluctuations in the fair value of other credit derivatives. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to Bank of England and PRA oversight in respect of resolution, and NatWest Group could be adversely affected should the Bank of England in the future deem NatWest Group's preparations to be inadequate.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to regulatory oversight by the Bank of England and the PRA and is required (under the PRA rulebook) to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA, and disclose a summary of this report. NatWest Group has dedicated significant resources towards the preparation of NatWest Group for a potential resolution scenario. In June 2022 the Bank of England communicated its assessment of NatWest Group's preparations and did not identify any shortcomings, deficiencies or substantive impediments although two areas were highlighted as requiring further enhancements. NatWest Group could be adversely affected should future Bank of England assessments deem NatWest Group's preparations to be inadequate.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n413\n\nIf future Bank of England assessments identify a significant gap in NatWest Group's ability to achieve the resolvability outcomes or reveals that NatWest Group is not adequately prepared to be resolved, or did not have adequate plans in place to meet resolvability requirements, NatWest Group may be required to take action to enhance its preparations to be resolvable, resulting in additional costs and the dedication of additional resources. Such a scenario may have an impact on NatWest Group as, depending on the Bank of England's assessment, potential action may include, but is not limited to, restrictions on NatWest Group's maximum individual and aggregate exposures, a requirement to dispose of specified assets, a requirement to change legal or operational structure, a requirement to cease carrying out certain activities and/or maintaining a specified amount of MREL. This may also impact NatWest Group's strategic plans and may adversely affect its financial condition and/or reputation or lead to a loss of investor confidence.\n\nNatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, for example, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities.\n\nHM Treasury, the Bank of England and the PRA and FCA (together, the 'Authorities') are granted substantial powers to resolve and stabilise UKincorporated financial institutions. Five stabilisation options exist: (i) transfer of all of the business of a relevant entity or the shares of the relevant entity to a private sector purchaser; (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' wholly-owned by the Bank of England; (iii) transfer of part of the assets, rights or liabilities of the relevant entity to one or more asset management vehicles for management of the transferor's assets, rights or liabilities; (iv) the write-down, conversion, transfer, modification, or suspension of the relevant entity's equity, capital instruments and liabilities; and (v) temporary public ownership of the relevant entity. These tools may be applied to NatWest Group plc as the parent company or an affiliate where certain conditions are met (such as, whether the firm is failing or likely to fail, or whether it is reasonably likely that action will be taken (outside of resolution) that will result in the firm no longer failing or being likely to fail). Moreover, there are modified insolvency and administration procedures for relevant entities,\n\nand the Authorities have the power to modify or override certain contractual arrangements in certain circumstances and amend the law for the purpose of enabling their powers to be used effectively and may promulgate provisions with retrospective applicability.\n\nUnder the UK Banking Act, the Authorities are generally required to have regard to specified objectives in exercising the powers provided for by the Banking Act. One of the objectives (which is required to be balanced as appropriate with the other specified objectives) refers to the protection and enhancement of the stability of the financial system of the UK. Moreover, the 'no creditor worse off' safeguard contained in the Banking Act may not apply in relation to an application of the separate write-down and conversion power relating to capital instruments under the Banking Act, in circumstances where a stabilisation power is not also used. Holders of debt instruments which are subject to the power may, however, have ordinary shares transferred to or issued to them by way of compensation.\n\nUncertainty exists as to how the Authorities may exercise their powers including the determination of actions undertaken in relation to the ordinary shares and other securities issued by NatWest Group, which may depend on factors outside of NatWest Group's control. Moreover, the Banking Act provisions remain largely untested in practice, particularly in respect of resolutions of large financial institutions and groups.\n\nIf NatWest Group is at or is approaching the point of non-viability such that regulatory intervention is required, any exercise of the resolution regime powers by the Authorities may adversely affect holders of NatWest Group plc's ordinary shares or other NatWest Group securities. This may result in various actions being undertaken in relation to NatWest Group and any securities of NatWest Group, including cancellation, transfer, dilution, write-down or conversion (as applicable). There may also be a corresponding adverse effect on the market price of such ordinary shares and other NatWest Group securities.",

The financial impacts of climaterelated risks are expected to be widespread, exacerbating already existing financial vulnerabilities and may disrupt the proper functioning of financial markets and institutions, including NatWest Group.\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks from climate change and sustainability-related risks can arise through physical and transition risks. In addition, physical and transition risks can trigger further losses, stemming directly or indirectly from legal claims, litigation and conduct liability (referred to as 'liability risk'). See also, ' NatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental, human rights and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk .'\n\nThere are significant uncertainties as to the location, extent and timing of the manifestation of the physical risks of climate change, such as more severe and frequent extreme weather events (storms, flooding, subsidence, heat waves, droughts and wildfires), rising sea levels, nature and biodiversity loss, declining food yields, destruction of critical infrastructure, supply chain disruption and resource scarcity. Damage to NatWest Group customers', suppliers' and counterparties' properties and operations could disrupt business, impair asset values and negatively impact the creditworthiness of customers leading to increased default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in NatWest Group's portfolios. In addition, NatWest Group premises and operations, or those of its critical outsourced functions may experience damage or disruption leading to increased costs and adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nIn October 2021, the UK Government published its Net Zero Strategy which sets out how the UK will deliver on its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 (defined as the point at which greenhouse gas emissions from sources are equal to removals by sinks as set out in Article 4 of the 2015 Paris Agreement). An independent review of the government's approach to delivering its net zero target to ensure it is probusiness and pro-growth was published in January 2023.\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nThe timing, content and implementation of the specific policies and proposals remain uncertain and are subject to continuous changes and developments. The transition to a net-zero economy across all sectors of the economy and markets in which NatWest Group operates will be required to meet the goals of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (1994), the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK's Net Zero Strategy and the European Green Deal initiatives. The impacts of the extensive social, commercial, technological, policy and regulatory changes required to achieve transition remain uncertain but are expected to be significant, subject to continuous changes and developments and may be disruptive across the global economy and markets, especially if these changes do not occur in an orderly or timely manner or are not effective in reducing emissions sufficiently. Some sectors such as property, energy (including the oil and gas industry), mobility (including land transport, aviation, and shipping industries and the related manufacturing and infrastructure industry) and food (including the agriculture industry) are expected to be particularly impacted. The timing and pace of the transition to a net-zero economy is also uncertain, will depend on many factors and uncertainties and may be near-term, gradual and orderly, or delayed, rapid and disorderly, or a combination of these. There is also growing attention on the need for a 'just transition' and 'energy justice' - in recognition that the transition to net zero should not disproportionally affect the most disadvantaged members of society.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group and its customers, suppliers and counterparties may face economic, financial and nonfinancial risks arising from broader sustainability issues such as: (i) risks relating to degradation of the environment, such as air, water and land pollution, water stress, nature and biodiversity loss and deforestation which may include for instance loss and/or decline of the state of nature (including the state of biodiversity); (ii) social matter-related risks (including violent conflicts, geopolitical implications, impacts on indigenous people, migration, human rights, diversity, equality and inclusion, the living wage, fair taxation and value chains); and (iii) governancerelated risks (including board diversity, ethics, executive compensation and management structure).\n\nFinancial institutions, including NatWest Group, are directly and indirectly exposed to multiple types of environmental risks (including nature and biodiversity related risks) through\n\n414\n\ntheir activities, including through the risk of default by clients.\n\nIn addition to safeguards and interventions that focus on reducing negative impacts on the environment (including nature and biodiversity), there is also a growing need to implement solutions that focus on increasing positive impacts on environment (including nature and biodiversity) through nature-based solutions. In 2021, NatWest Group classified ' Biodiversity and Nature Loss ' as an emerging risk for NatWest Group within its Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is a global, market-led initiative with the mission to develop and deliver a risk management and disclosure framework for organisations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks and opportunities, with the ultimate aim of supporting a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes. NatWest Group is a member of the Informal Working Group 2020 of TNFD and is a Forum Member since 2021.\n\nMeasuring the environmental related financial impacts (including impacts on nature and biodiversity related financial impacts) as a result of funding and financing activities as well as reporting on these is an evolving and complex area for the financial services industry which requires collaborative approaches with partners, stakeholders, peers and public sector bodies to help measure and mitigate the negative impacts of the activities which NatWest Group finances on the environment (including nature and biodiversity), as well as supporting the growing sector of nature-based solutions and habitat restoration and biodiversity markets. NatWest Group is in the early stages of developing its approach to assess, manage and mitigate environmental risks and by using emerging industry guidance such as the TNFD beta framework, NatWest Group is seeking to further its understanding of how NatWest Group's business activities impact nature, the dependencies NatWest Group and its customers have on nature, and the risks and opportunities nature can generate.\n\nThere is also increased scrutiny from NatWest Group's employees, investors, customers, counterparties (including its suppliers), communities, regulators and other stakeholders regarding how businesses address social issues, including tackling inequality, working conditions, workplace health, safety and wellbeing,\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\ndiversity and inclusion, data protection and management, workforce management, human rights and supply chain management which may impact\n\nNatWest Group's employees, suppliers, customers, and their business activities or the communities in which they operate.\n\nThese climate and sustainability-related risks may:\n\n- \uf02d adversely affect economic activity, asset pricing and valuations of financial instruments and, in turn, the wider financial system;\n- \uf02d impact economic activities directly (for example through lower corporate profitability or the devaluation of assets) or indirectly (for example through macro-financial changes);\n- \uf02d also affect the viability or resilience of business models over the medium to longer term, particularly those business models most vulnerable to climate and sustainability-related risks;\n- \uf02d trigger further losses stemming directly or indirectly from legal claims (liability risks) and reputational damage as a result of the public, customers, counterparties, suppliers and/or investors associating NatWest Group or its customers with adverse climate and sustainability-related issues;\n- \uf02d intersect with and add further complexity and challenge to achieving NatWest Group's purposeled strategy including climate ambitions and targets;\n- \uf02d be drivers of several different risk categories simultaneously and may exacerbate existing risks, including credit risk, operational risk (including business continuity), market risk (both traded and non-traded), liquidity and funding risk (for example, net cash outflows or depletion of liquidity buffers), pension risk and conduct risk; and\n- \uf02d if combined, may have a greater adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nIf NatWest Group fails in a timely manner to identify and address climate and sustainability-related risks and opportunities and changing regulatory and market expectations, or to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate climate and sustainabilityrelated physical, transition and liability risks and opportunities that NatWest Group, its customers, counterparties and suppliers face, this may adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n415\n\nNatWest Group's climate change related strategy, ambitions, targets and transition plan entail significant execution and reputational risk and are unlikely to be achieved without significant and timely government policy, technology and customer behavioural changes.\n\nIn February 2020, NatWest Group announced its ambition to become a leading bank in the UK helping to address the climate challenge. As part of the implementation of its climate ambitions, at NatWest Group's Annual General Meeting in April 2022, ordinary shareholders passed an advisory 'Say on Climate' resolution endorsing NatWest Group's previously announced strategy to address climate change, including its ambitions to at least halve the climate impact of its financing activity by 2030, achieve alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach net zero by 2050 across its financed emissions, assets under management and operational value chain.\n\nFurthermore, as part of its efforts to support the transition to a net-zero economy, NatWest Group has announced its plans to (i) stop lending and underwriting to companies with more than 15% of activities related to thermal and lignite coal, unless they had a Credible Transition Plan in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement in place by end of 2021; phase out of thermal and lignite coal for UK and non-UK customers who have UK coal production, coal-fired generation and coal-related infrastructure by 1 October 2024, with a full global phase out by 1 January 2030; (ii) to stop lending and underwriting to major oil and gas producers unless they had a Credible Transition Plan aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement in place by the end of 2021; (iii) from February 2023 stop providing reserve based lending specifically for the purpose of financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production for new customers, and, after the 31 December 2025 not to renew, refinance or extend existing reserve- based lending specifically for the purpose of financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production; and (iv) stop providing reserve-based lending and borrowing base financing to upstream Oil and Gas companies specifically for the purpose of financing upstream assets located in Arctic or Antarctic Waters.\n\nIn December 2022, NatWest Group published its science based targets validated by Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for its own operational footprint and for 79% of its loans and investments (debt securities and equity shares) on its 2019 balance sheet, at sector level.\n\nNatWest Group has also announced and in the future it may also announce other climate ambitions and targets which support its overarching strategy to address climate change.\n\nMaking the changes necessary to achieve NatWest Group's strategy on addressing climate change, including its climate ambitions and targets and executing its transition plan, may adversely affect NatWest Group's business and operations and will require significant reductions to its financed emissions and to its exposure to customers that do not align with a transition to net zero or do not have a credible transition plan in place. Increases in lending and financing activities may wholly or partially offset some or all these reductions, which may increase the extent of changes and reductions necessary. It is anticipated that achieving these reductions, together with the active management of climate and sustainability-related risks and other regulatory, policy and market changes, is likely to necessitate material and accelerated changes to NatWest Group's business, operating model, its existing exposures and the products and services NatWest Group provides to its customers (potentially on accelerated timescales) which may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to achieve its financial targets and generate sustainable returns.\n\nNatWest Group also needs to ensure that its strategy and business model adapt to changing national and international standards, industry and scientific practices, regulatory requirements and market expectations regarding climate change, which remain under continuous development and are subject to different interpretations. There can be no assurance that these standards, practices, requirements and expectations will not be interpreted differently than what was NatWest Group's understanding when defining its climaterelated ambitions and targets or change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for NatWest Group to achieve such ambitions and targets. In addition, NatWest Group's ambitions and targets may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve under such changing circumstances. This may be exacerbated if NatWest Group chooses or is required to accelerate its climate-related ambitions or targets as a result of (among other things) UK or international regulatory developments or stakeholder expectations.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to achieve its strategy to address climate change, including achieving its climate ambitions and targets, will depend to a large extent\n\n<!-- image -->",

See also, ' There are significant challenges in accessing reliable, verifiable and comparable climate and other sustainability-related data due to availability, quality and other limitations, which contribute to the substantial uncertainties in accurately modelling and reporting on climate and sustainability information, as well as making appropriate important internal decisions '.\n\nThese external factors and other uncertainties will make it challenging for NatWest Group to meet its climate ambitions and targets and there is a significant risk that all or some of them will not be achieved.\n\nAny delay or failure in setting, making progress against or meeting NatWest Group's climate-related ambitions and targets may adversely affect NatWest Group, its reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects and may increase the climate and sustainability-related risks NatWest Group faces.\n\nThere are significant limitations related to accessing reliable, verifiable and comparable climate and other sustainability-related data, including as a result of lack of standardisation, consistency and completeness which, alongside other factors, contribute to substantial uncertainties in accurately modelling and reporting on climate and sustainability information, as well as making appropriate important internal decisions.\n\nMeaningful reporting of climate and sustainability-related risks and opportunities and their potential impacts and related metrics depends on access to accurate, reliable, consistent and comparable climate and sustainabilityrelated data from counterparties or customers. Data may not be generally available or, if available, may not be accurate, verifiable, auditable, reliable, consistent, or comparable.\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAny failure of NatWest Group to incorporate climate and/or sustainabilityrelated factors into its counterparty and customer data sourcing and accompanying analytics, or to collect or develop accurate, verifiable, auditable, reliable, consistent and comparable counterparty and customer data, may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to prepare meaningful reporting of climate and sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and it may adversely affect NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, reputation, business and its competitive position.\n\nIn the absence of other sources, reporting of financed emissions by financial institutions, including NatWest Group, is necessarily based on aggregated information developed by third parties that may be prepared in an inconsistent way using different methodologies, interpretations, or assumptions. NatWest Group's climate and sustainability-related disclosures use a greater number and level of assumptions and estimates than many of its financial disclosures. These assumptions and estimates are highly likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the longer timeframes used in these climate and sustainabilityrelated disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain.\n\nIn particular, in the absence of actual emissions monitoring and measurement, emissions estimates are based on industry and other assumptions that may not be accurate for a given counterparty or customer. There may also be data gaps that are filled using proxy data, such as sectoral averages, again developed in different ways. As a result, NatWest Group's climate and sustainability-related disclosures may be amended, updated or restated in the future as the quality and completeness of NatWest Group's data and methodologies continue to improve. These data quality challenges, gaps and limitations could have a material impact on NatWest Group's ability to make effective business decisions about climate risks and opportunities, including risk management decisions, to comply with disclosure requirements and to monitor and report progress in meeting ambitions and targets.\n\nSignificant risks, uncertainties and variables are inherent in the assessment, measurement and mitigation of climaterelated risks.\n\n416\n\nThese include data quality gaps and limitations mentioned above, as well as the pace at which climate science, greenhouse gas accounting standards and various emissions reduction solutions develop. In addition, there is significant uncertainty about how climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy will unfold over the coming years and decades and how and when climaterelated risks will manifest. These timeframes are considerably longer than NatWest Group's historical strategic, financial, resilience and investment planning horizons.\n\nAs a result, it is very difficult to predict and model the impact of climate-related risks into precise financial and economic outcomes and impacts . . Climate-related risks present significant methodological challenges due to their forward-looking nature, the lack and/or quality of historical testing capabilities, lack of standardisation and incompleteness of emissions and other climate and subsector related data and the immature nature of risk measurement and modelling methodologies. The evaluation of climate-related risk exposure and the development of associated potential risk mitigation techniques largely depend on the choice of climate scenario modelling methodology and the assumptions made which involves a number of risks and uncertainties, for example:\n\n- \uf02d climate scenarios are not predictions of what is likely to happen or what NatWest Group would like to happen, rather they explore the possible implications of different judgments and assumptions by considering a series of scenarios;\n- \uf02d climate scenarios do not provide a comprehensive description of all possible future outcomes;\n- \uf02d lack of specialist expertise in banks such that NatWest Group needs to rely on third party advice, modelling, and data which is also subject to many limitations and uncertainties;\n- \uf02d immaturity of modelling of and data on climate-related risks on financial assets which will evolve rapidly in the coming years;\n- \uf02d the number of variables and forwardlooking nature of climate scenarios which makes them challenging to back test and benchmark;\n- \uf02d the significant uncertainty as to how the climate will evolve over time, how and when governments, regulators, businesses, investors and customers respond and how those responses impact the economy, asset valuations, land systems, energy systems, technology, policy and wider society;\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n- \uf02d the assumptions will be continually evolving with more data/information which may affect the baselines for comparability across reporting periods and impact internal and external verification processes; and\n- \uf02d the pace of the development of the methodologies across different sectors may be different and therefore it may be challenging to report on the whole balance sheet with regard to emissions.\n\nAccordingly, these risks and uncertainties coupled with significantly longer timeframes make the outputs of climate-related risk modelling, including emission reduction targets and pathways, inherently more uncertain than outputs modelled for traditional financial planning cycles based on historical financial information. Furthermore, there is a lack of scientific, industry and regulatory consensus regarding the appropriate metrics, methodologies, modelling and standardised reporting to enable the assessment of the location, acuteness, and severity of environmental risks (including nature and biodiversity-related risks) and the monitoring and mitigation of these risks in the economy and financial system.\n\nCapabilities within NatWest Group to appropriately assess, model, report and manage climate and sustainabilityrelated risks and impacts and the suitability of the assumptions required to model and manage climate and sustainability-related risks appropriately are developing. The development of NatWest Group's capabilities to assess, model, report and manage the impacts of climate change and broader environmental risk (including nature and biodiversity-related risks) is in its early stages. Even when those capabilities are developed, the high level of uncertainty regarding any assumptions modelled, the highly subjective nature of risk measurement and mitigation techniques, incorrect or inadequate assumptions and judgments and data quality gaps and limitations may lead to inadequate risk management information and frameworks, or ineffective business adaptation or mitigation strategies, which may adversely affect NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nA failure to implement effective climate change resilient governance, procedures, systems and controls in compliance with legal and regulatory expectations to manage climate and sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities could adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to manage those risks.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n417\n\nThe prudential regulation of climaterelated risks is an important driver in how NatWest Group develops its risk appetite for financing activities or engaging with counterparties. Legislative and regulatory authorities are publishing expectations as to how banks should prudently manage and transparently disclose climate-related and environmental risks under prudential rules.\n\nIn April 2019, the PRA published a supervisory statement ('SS 3/19') with particular focus on the management of financial risks from climate change with respect to governance, risk management, scenario analysis and disclosures. In response to the PRA's SS 3/19, following the submission of initial plans in October 2019, on 8 October 2020 NatWest Group provided the PRA with an update to its original plan, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted some elements of its original plan and, as a result, the updated plan would require additional operating cycles reaching into 2022 and beyond to prove embedding. Throughout 2022, NatWest Group provided the PRA with updates on how it had addressed the commitments made in its October 2020 plan, noting the delivery of a first generation, largely qualitative in nature, approach to the supervisory requirements. In 2022, the PRA has also started actively supervising firms against their supervisory expectations and it issued another 'Dear CEO letter' providing a summary of capabilities which the PRA would expect firms to be able to demonstrate, setting out thematic observations on firms' levels of embeddedness, and providing examples of effective practices identified.\n\nIn June 2021, the Bank of England launched its 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario ('2021 CBES') to stress test the resilience of the current business models of the largest banks, insurers and the financial system to the physical and transition risks from climate change under three climate scenarios. NatWest Group delivered its first 2021 CBES submission to the PRA in October 2021 and its submission to the second phase of the 2021 CBES exercise in the first quarter of 2022. In May 2022, the PRA published the results of the 2021 CBES which has shown that UK banks, including NatWest Group, need to do more to understand and manage their exposure to climate risks and that the lack of available data on corporates' current emissions and future transition plans is a collective issue affecting all participating firms.\n\nIn July 2022, the participating banks in the 2021 CBES exercise were invited to discuss methodologies and challenges with regards to climate risk scenario analysis.\n\nIn October 2022, the Bank of England and the PRA held a conference to facilitate discussion on the complex issues associated with adjusting the capital framework to take account of climate-related financial risks with the aim of providing more guidance on its approach to climate and capital by the end of 2022. The Bank of England does not think capital frameworks should be used to address the causes of climate change. However, as set out in the PRA's Climate Change Adaptation Report 2021, and as with any other risk, it does think the capital framework could be a useful tool within the broader regulatory frameworks to ensure that PRAregulated firms are resilient to climate risks.\n\nAny failure of NatWest Group to fully and timely embed climate-related risks into its risk management practices and framework to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate the various climate-related physical and transition risks and apply the appropriate product governance in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and expectations, may adversely affect NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, prudential capital requirements, liquidity position, reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nClimate and sustainability-related disclosures are a rapidly evolving area and increasingly expose NatWest Group to risk in the face of legal and regulatory expectations, regulatory enforcement and class action risk. NatWest Group and its subsidiaries currently are and in the future will be subject to increasing entitywide climate-related and other nonfinancial disclosure requirements, including pursuant to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure ('TCFD'), the proposed SEC Climate Disclosure Rules and ISSB sustainability reporting requirements and under other regimes. As from February 2022, NatWest Group is required to provide enhanced climate-related disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations to comply with the FCA Policy Statement on 'Proposals to enhance climate-related disclosures by listed issuers and clarification of existing disclosure obligations' (PS 20/17) which introduced new Listing Rules that require commercial companies with a UK premium listing - such as NatWest Group - to make climate-related disclosures,",

In addition, as of the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2022, NatWest Group is also in scope of the FCA Policy Statement 'Enhancing climate-related disclosures by standard listed companies' (PS 21/23) which confirmed its final policy position set forth in PS 20/17, extended the scope of issuers that are subject to the new Listing Rules and added guidance provisions on transition plan disclosure (for issuers in scope of both the PS 20/17 and the new PS 21/23 rules). As of 5 April 2022, NatWest Group is also required to prepare mandatory climaterelated financial disclosures pursuant to The Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022.\n\nFurthermore, in October 2022, the FCA published a Consultation Paper on 'Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) and investment labels' (CP 22/20) which proposes that the FCA will require all regulated firms to ensure that from June 2023 the naming and marketing of financial products and services in the UK is clear, fair and not misleading, and consistent with the sustainability profile of the products or services, i.e. proportionate and not exaggerated.\n\nMisrepresenting or over-emphasising the extent to which an investment, strategy or other type of product takes into account environmentally friendly, sustainable or ethical features and concerns, using misleading labels and language in relation to such products and/or omitting material information about NatWest Group's contribution to the climate crisis (including its direct or indirect contribution to greenhouse gas emissions), or other sustainability-related issues, could potentially result in complaints, regulatory intervention, claims and/or litigation and reputational damage.\n\nAny failure of NatWest Group to implement robust and effective climate and sustainability-related disclosure governance and to embed appropriate product governance policies, procedures and controls to make accurate public statements and claims about how environmentally friendly, sustainable or ethical NatWest Group's products and services are and to apply these in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and expectations, may adversely affect NatWest Group's regulatory compliance and reputation and could give rise to litigation.\n\nIncreasing levels of climate, environmental, human rights and other sustainability-related laws, regulation and oversight which are constantly\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\n## evolving may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nThere is an increasing number of EU, UK and other regulatory and legislative initiatives to address issues around climate change (including promoting the transition to a net-zero economy), environment (including nature and biodiversity), human rights and other sustainability-related risks and opportunities. As a result, an increasing number of laws, regulations and legislative actions, including proposals, guidance, policy and regulatory initiatives many of which have been introduced or amended recently and are subject to further changes, is likely to affect the financial sector and the wider economy.\n\nMany of these initiatives are focused on developing standardised definitions and criteria for green and sustainable criteria of assets and liabilities, integrating climate change and sustainability into decision-making and customers' access to green and sustainable financial products and services which may have a significant impact on the services provided by NatWest Group, and its subsidiaries and its associated credit, market and financial risk profile. They could also impact NatWest Group's recognition of its climate and sustainable funding and financing activity and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to achieve its strategy and climate and sustainable funding and financing ambitions.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group's EU and other non-UK subsidiaries and branches are and will continue to be subject to an increasing array of the EU/EEA and US climate and sustainability-related legal and regulatory requirements. These requirements (potentially including the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive or the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) may be applicable to UK businesses such as NatWest Group, or used as the basis for UK laws and regulations (such as the UK Green Taxonomy and the FCA's Consultation Paper on 'Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) and investment labels' (CP 22/20)), or be regarded by investors and regulators as best practice standards whether or not they apply to UK businesses (such as the EU Green Bond Standard). Any divergence between UK, EU/EEA and US climate and sustainability-related legal and regulatory requirements and their interpretation may result in NatWest Group, or any of its subsidiaries, not meeting regulatory requirements, investors' expectations, may increase the cost of doing business (including increased operating costs) and contentious regulatory and litigation risk\n\n418\n\nand may restrict access of NatWest Group's UK business to the EU/EEA and US market.\n\nNatWest Group is also participating in various voluntary carbon reporting and other standard setting initiatives for disclosing climate and sustainabilityrelated information, many of which have differing objectives and methodologies and are at different stages of development in terms of how they apply to financial institutions.\n\nCompliance with these developing and evolving climate and sustainabilityrelated legal and regulatory requirements is likely to require NatWest Group to implement significant changes to its business models, products and other governance, internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, modelling capability and risk management systems, which may increase the cost of doing business, and entail additional change risk and increased compliance, regulatory sanctions and litigation (including settlements) costs.\n\nFailure to implement and comply with these legal and regulatory requirements or emerging best practice expectations may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance and may result in regulatory sanctions, reputational damage and investor disapproval each of which may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nNatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental, human rights and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk.\n\nDue to increasing new climate and sustainability-related jurisprudence, laws and regulations in the UK and other jurisdictions, growing demand from investors and customers for environmentally sustainable products and services, and regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions, including NatWest Group, may through their business activities, face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation, human rights violations and other social, governance and sustainability-related issues.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk factors continued\n\nThese risks may arise, for example, from claims pertaining to: (i) failure to meet obligations, targets or commitments relating to, or to disclose accurately, or provide updates on material climate and/or sustainability-related risks, or otherwise provide fair, balanced and appropriate disclosure to investors, customers, counterparties and other stakeholders; (ii) conduct, mis-selling and customer protection claims, including claims which may relate to alleged insufficient product understanding, unsuitable product offering and /or reliance upon information provided by NatWest Group or claims alleging unfair pricing of climate-related products, for example in relation to products where limited liquidity or reliable market data exists for benchmarking purposes or which may be impacted by future climate policy uncertainty or other factors; (iii) marketing that portrays products, securities, activities or policies as having positive climate, environmental or sustainable outcomes to an extent that may not be the case, or may not adequately be qualified and/or omits material information about NatWest Group's contribution to the climate crisis and/or its direct / indirect contribution to greenhouse gas emissions or other sustainability-related issues; (iv) damages claims under various tort theories, including common law public nuisance claims, or negligent mismanagement of physical and/or transition risks; (v) alleged violations of officers', directors' and other fiduciaries' duties, for example by financing various carbon-intensive, environmentally harmful or otherwise highly exposed assets, companies, and industries; (vi) changes in the understanding of what constitutes positive climate, environmental or sustainable outcomes as a result of developing climate science, leading to discrepancy between current product offerings and investor and/or market and/or broader stakeholder expectations; (vii) any weaknesses or failures in specific systems or processes associated particularly with climate, environmental or sustainability linked products, and/or human rights due diligence, including any failure in the timely implementation, onboarding and/or updating of such systems or processes; or (viii) counterparties, collaborators, customers to whom NatWest Group provides services and third parties in NatWest Group's value chain who act, or fail to act, or undertake due diligence, or apply appropriate risk management and product governance in a manner that may adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation or sustainability credentials.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n419\n\nFurthermore, there is a risk that shareholders, campaign groups, customers and special interest groups could seek to take legal action against NatWest Group for financing or contributing to climate change, environmental degradation and human rights violations and for not supporting the principles of 'just transition' (i.e. maximising the social benefits of the transition, mitigating the social risks of the transition, empowering those affected by the change, anticipating future shifts to address issues up front and mobilising investments from the public and private sectors).\n\nThere is a risk that as environmental and climate science develop and societal understanding of these issues increases and deepens, courts, regulators and enforcement authorities may apply the then current understandings of environmental, climate and broader sustainability-related matters retrospectively when assessing claims about historical conduct or dealings of financial institutions, including NatWest Group. See also, ' NatWest Group is exposed to the risks of various litigation matters, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations as well as remedial undertakings, including conduct-related reviews, anti-money laundering and redress projects, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, and which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group' .\n\nThese potential litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to achieve its strategy, including its climate ambition, and may adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nA reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and on investors' risk appetite and customers' willingness to deal with NatWest Group.\n\nESG ratings from agencies and data providers which rate how NatWest Group manages environmental, social and governance risks are increasingly influencing investment decisions pertaining to NatWest Group's and/or its subsidiaries' securities or being used as a basis to label financial products and services as environmentally friendly or sustainable.\n\nESG ratings are (i) unsolicited; (ii) subject to the assessment and interpretation by the ESG rating agencies; (iii) provided without warranty; (iv) not a sponsorship, endorsement, or promotion of NatWest Group by the relevant rating agency; and (v) may depend on many factors some of which are beyond NatWest Group's control (e.g. any change in rating methodology). In addition, certain NatWest Group entities offer or sell products and services to customers and counterparties based exclusively or largely on a rating by an unregulated ESG rating agency. ESG rating agencies, at this stage, are not subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight (although there are proposals by regulators in different jurisdictions to regulate rating agencies and data providers). Regulators have expressed concern that harm may arise from potential conflicts of interest within ESG rating and review or opinion providers and there is a lack of transparency in methodologies and data points, which renders ratings and reviews incomparable between agencies or providers.  There is currently no market consensus on what precise attributes are required for a particular asset to be classified as 'ESG'. Any reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group, or a regulatory sanction or enforcement action involving an ESG rating agency used by a NatWest Group entity, could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation, could influence investors' risk appetite for NatWest Group's and/or its subsidiaries' securities, particularly ESG securities, could increase the cost of issuing securities for NatWest Group and/or its subsidiaries and could affect a customer's willingness to deal with NatWest Group.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  aanndd  IITT  rreessiilliieennccee  rriisskk\n\nOperational risks (including reliance on third party suppliers and outsourcing of certain activities) are inherent in NatWest Group's businesses.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or disruption resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, procedures, people or systems, or from external events, including legal and regulatory risks.

' These risks are also present when NatWest Group relies on critical service providers (suppliers) or vendors to provide services to it or its customers, as is increasingly the case as NatWest Group outsources certain activities, including with respect to the implementation of technologies, innovation and responding to regulatory and market changes.\n\nOperational risks continue to be heightened as a result of the implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy, and the organisational and operational changes involved, including: NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI, NatWest Group's current cost-controlling measures, the NatWest Markets refocusing, the creation of the Commercial & Institutional business segment, the progression towards working as One Bank across NatWest Group to serve customers and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally (including macroeconomic and other geo-political developments) as well as the legal and regulatory uncertainty resulting therefrom. It is unclear as to how the future ways of working may evolve, including in respect of how working practices may develop, or how NatWest Group will evolve to best serve its customers. Any of the above may place significant pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks.\n\nThe effective management of operational risks is critical to meeting customer service expectations and retaining and attracting customer business. Although NatWest Group has implemented risk controls and mitigation actions, with resources and planning having been devoted to mitigate operational risk, such measures may not be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by NatWest Group. Ineffective management of such risks may adversely affect NatWest Group's future\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nresults, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\n## NatWest Group is subject to increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyberattacks.\n\nNatWest Group experiences a constant threat from cyberattacks across the entire NatWest Group and against NatWest Group's supply chain, reinforcing the importance of due diligence of and close working relationship with the third parties on which NatWest Group relies. NatWest Group is reliant on technology, against which there is a constantly evolving series of attacks that are increasing in terms of frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. As cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group is required to continue to invest in additional capability designed to defend against emerging threats. In 2022, NatWest Group and its supply chain were subjected to a small number of Distributed Denial of Service ('DDOS') and ransomware attacks, which are a pervasive and significant threat to the financial services industry. The focus is to manage the impact of the attacks and sustain availability of services for NatWest Group's customers. NatWest Group continues to invest significant resources in the development and evolution of cyber security controls that are designed to minimise the potential effect of such attacks.\n\nHostile attempts are made by third parties to gain access to, introduce malware (including ransomware) into and exploit vulnerabilities of, NatWest Group's IT systems. NatWest Group has information and cyber security controls in place to seek to minimise the impact of any such attacks, which are subject to review on a continuing basis but given the nature of the threat, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the potential negative impacts of any such attacks from occurring. See also, ' NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group. '\n\nAny failure in NatWest Group's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, may result in significant financial losses, major business disruption, inability to deliver customer services, or loss of data or systems or other sensitive information (including as a result of an outage) and may cause associated reputational damage. Any of these factors could increase costs (including costs relating to notification of, or compensation for customers, credit monitoring or card reissuance), result in regulatory investigations or sanctions being imposed or may affect NatWest Group's ability to retain and attract\n\n420\n\ncustomers. Regulators in the UK, US, Europe and Asia continue to recognise cybersecurity as an important systemic risk to the financial sector and have highlighted the need for financial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience (particularly of critical services) to cyberattacks, and to provide timely reporting or notification of them, as appropriate. Cyberattacks on NatWest Group's counterparties may also damage NatWest Group's operations.\n\nAdditionally, third parties may also fraudulently attempt to induce employees, customers, third-party providers or other users who have access to NatWest Group's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to NatWest Group's data or systems or that of NatWest Group's customers or employees. Cybersecurity and information security events can derive from groups or factors such as: internal or external threat actors, human error, fraud or malice on the part of NatWest Group's employees or third parties, including third party providers, or may result from technological failure. Any of the above may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nNatWest Group expects greater regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement to continue at a high level in relation to its overall resilience to withstand IT and IT-related disruption, either through a cyberattack or some other disruptive event. Such increased regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement is uncertain in relation to the scope, cost, consequence and the pace of change, which may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects. Due to NatWest Group's reliance on technology and the increasing sophistication, frequency and impact of cyberattacks, such attacks may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group.\n\nIn accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018, the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments Etc.)

A failure to monitor and manage data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Framework and EBA requirements of the applicable legislation may result in financial losses, regulatory fines and investigations and associated reputational damage.\n\n## NatWest Group operations and strategy are highly dependent on the accuracy and effective use of data.\n\nNatWest Group relies on the effective use of accurate data to support, monitor, evaluate, manage and enhance its operations and deliver its strategy. Investment is being made in data tools and analytics, including raising awareness around data ethical usage and privacy across NatWest Group. The availability and accessibility of current, complete, detailed, accurate and, wherever possible, machine-readable customer segment and sub-sector data, together with appropriate governance and accountability for data, is fast becoming a critical strategic asset, which is subject to increased regulatory focus. Failure to have or be able to access that data or the ineffective use or governance of that data could result in a failure to manage and report important risks and opportunities or satisfy customers' expectations including the inability to deliver products and services. This could also result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy and could place NatWest Group at a competitive disadvantage by increasing its costs, inhibiting its efforts to reduce costs or its ability to improve its systems, controls and processes, which could result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy. These data weaknesses and limitations, or the unethical or inappropriate use of data, and/or noncompliance with data protection laws could give rise to conduct and litigation risks and may increase the risk of operational challenges, losses, reputational damage or other adverse consequences due to inappropriate models, systems, processes, decisions or other actions.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on the ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n421\n\ncomplying with applicable laws and regulations. The proper functioning of NatWest Group's payment systems, financial crime, fraud systems and controls, risk management, credit analysis and reporting, accounting, customer service and other IT systems (some of which are owned and operated by other entities in NatWest Group or third parties), as well as the communication networks between its branches and main data processing centres, is critical to NatWest Group's operations.\n\nIndividually or collectively, any critical system failure, material loss of service availability or material breach of data security could cause significant damage to: (i) important business services across NatWest Group and (ii) NatWest Group's ability to provide services to its customers, which could result in reputational damage, significant compensation costs and regulatory sanctions (including fines resulting from regulatory investigations) or a breach of applicable regulations and could affect NatWest Group's regulatory approvals, competitive position, business and brands, which could undermine its ability to attract and retain customers. NatWest Group outsources certain functions as it innovates and offers new digital solutions to its customers to meet the demand for online and mobile banking. Outsourcing alongside hybrid working patterns of NatWest Group employees, heighten the above risks.\n\nNatWest Group uses IT systems that enable remote working interface with third-party systems, and NatWest Group could experience service denials or disruptions if such systems exceed capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences any interruptions, all of which could result in business and customer interruption and related reputational damage, significant compensation costs, regulatory sanctions and/or a breach of applicable regulations.\n\nIn 2022, NatWest Group continued to make considerable investments to further simplify, upgrade and improve its IT and technology capabilities (including migration of certain services to cloud platforms). NatWest Group also continues to develop and enhance digital services for its customers and seeks to improve its competitive position through enhancing controls and procedures and strengthening the resilience of services including cyber security. Any failure of these investment and rationalisation initiatives to achieve the expected results, due to cost challenges or otherwise, may adversely affect NatWest Group's operations, its reputation and ability to retain or grow its customer\n\nbusiness or adversely affect its competitive position.\n\nNatWest Group relies on attracting, retaining and developing diverse senior management and skilled personnel, and is required to maintain good employee relations.\n\nNatWest Group's success depends on its ability to attract, retain through creating an inclusive environment, and develop highly skilled and qualified diverse personnel, including senior management, directors and key employees especially for technology and data focused roles, in a highly competitive market and under internal cost efficiency pressures.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to do this may be more difficult due to the costcontrolling measures, a failure to pay employees competitive compensation, heightened regulatory oversight of banks and the increasing scrutiny of, and (in some cases) restrictions placed upon, employee compensation arrangements (in particular those of banks that have been in receipt of government support such as NatWest Group). This may impact the cost of hiring, training and retaining diverse skilled personnel. In addition, certain economic, market and regulatory conditions and political developments may reduce the pool of candidates for key management and non-executive roles, including nonexecutive directors with the right skills, knowledge and experience, or increase the number of departures of existing employees. Moreover, a failure to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce may adversely affect NatWest Group's employee engagement and the formulation and execution of its strategy and could also have an adverse effect on its reputation with customers, investors and regulators.\n\nThe inability to compensate employees competitively and/or any reduction of compensation, as a result of negative economic developments or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to hire, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, especially at a senior level, which may adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nMany of NatWest Group's employees in the UK, the ROI and continental Europe are represented by employee representative bodies, including trade unions and works councils. Engagement with its employees and such bodies is important to NatWest Group in maintaining good employee relations. Any failure to do so may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to operate its business effectively.",

NatWest Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework sets out the approach for managing risk within the NatWest Group including in relation to risk governance and risk appetite. A failure to adhere to this framework, or any material weaknesses or deficiencies in the framework's controls and procedures, could adversely affect NatWest Group's financial condition and strategic delivery including in relation to inaccurate adherence to agreed risk appetite statements and accurate risk reporting of risk exposures.\n\nIn addition, financial crime risk management is dependent on the use and effectiveness of financial crime assessment, systems and controls. Weak or ineffective financial crime processes and controls may risk NatWest Group inadvertently facilitating financial crime which may result in regulatory investigation, sanction, litigation, fines and reputational damage. Financial crime continues to evolve, whether through fraud, scams, cyber-attacks or other criminal activity. NatWest Group has made and continues to make significant, multi-year investments to strengthen and improve its overall financial crime control framework with prevention systems and capabilities. As part of its ongoing programme of investment, there is current and future investment planned to further strengthen financial crime controls over the coming years, including investment in new technologies and capabilities to further enhance customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption systems.\n\nIneffective risk management may arise from a wide variety of factors, including lack of transparency or incomplete risk reporting, manual processes and controls, inaccurate data, inadequate IT systems, unidentified conflicts or misaligned incentives, lack of accountability control and governance, incomplete risk monitoring and management or insufficient challenges or assurance processes or a failure to timely complete risk remediation projects. Failure to manage risks effectively, or within regulatory expectations, could adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation or its relationship with its regulators, customers, shareholders or other stakeholders.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are inherently exposed to conduct risks,\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nwhich include business decisions, actions or reward mechanisms that are not responsive to or aligned with NatWest Group's regulatory obligations, customers' needs or do not reflect NatWest Group's customer-focused strategy, ineffective product management, unethical or inappropriate use of data, information asymmetry, implementation and utilisation of new technologies, outsourcing of customer service and product delivery, the possibility of mis-selling of financial products and mishandling of customer complaints. Some of these risks have materialised in the past and ineffective management and oversight of conduct risks may lead to further remediation and regulatory intervention or enforcement.\n\nNatWest Group's businesses are also exposed to risks from employee misconduct including non-compliance with policies and regulations, negligence or fraud (including financial crimes and fraud), any of which could result in regulatory fines or sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm to NatWest Group. Remote working arrangements for NatWest Group employees continues to place heavy reliance on the IT systems that enable remote working and may place additional pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks. Remote working arrangements are also subject to regulatory scrutiny to ensure adequate recording, surveillance and supervision of regulated activities, and compliance with regulatory requirements and expectations, including requirements to: meet threshold conditions for regulated activities; ensure the ability to oversee functions (including any outsourced functions); ensure no detriment is caused to customers; and ensure no increased risk of financial crime.\n\nNatWest Group has been seeking to embed a strong risk culture across the organisation and has implemented policies and allocated new resources across all levels of the organisation to manage and mitigate conduct risk and expects to continue to invest in risk management, including the ongoing development of a risk management strategy in line with regulatory expectations. However, such efforts may not insulate NatWest Group from instances of misconduct and no assurance can be given that NatWest Group's strategy and control framework will be effective.\n\n422\n\nAny failure in NatWest Group's risk management framework could negatively affect NatWest Group and its financial condition through reputational and financial harm and may result in the inability to achieve its strategic objectives for its customers, employees and wider stakeholders.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are subject to inherent reputational risk.\n\nReputational risk relates to stakeholder and public perceptions of NatWest Group arising from an actual or perceived failure to meet stakeholder or the public's expectations, including with respect to NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy and related targets, the creation of the Commercial & Institutional business segment, the progression towards working as One Bank across the NatWest Group to serve customers, or due to any events, behaviour, action or inaction by NatWest Group, its employees or those with whom NatWest Group is associated.

Reputational risk may arise whenever there is, or there is perceived to be, a material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer or operating efficiency and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to attract and retain customers. In particular, NatWest Group's ability to attract and retain customers (particularly, corporate/institutional and retail depositors) and engage with counterparties may be adversely affected by factors including: negative public opinion resulting from the actual or perceived manner in which NatWest Group conducts or modifies its business activities and operations, media coverage (whether accurate or otherwise), employee misconduct, NatWest Group's financial performance, IT systems failures or cyberattacks, data breaches, financial crime and fraud, the level of direct and indirect government support, or the actual or perceived practices in the banking and financial industry in general, or a wide variety of other factors.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk factors continued\n\nModern technologies, in particular online social networks and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short timeframes and with minimal costs, may also significantly increase and accelerate the impact of damaging information and allegations.\n\nAlthough NatWest Group has implemented a Reputational Risk Policy to monitor the identification, assessment and management of customers, transactions, products and issues, which represent a reputational risk, NatWest Group cannot be certain that it will be successful in avoiding damage to its business from reputational risk.\n\n## L Leeggaall,,  rreegguullaattoorryy  aanndd  ccoonndduucctt  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group's businesses are subject to substantial regulation and oversight, which are constantly evolving and may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to extensive laws, regulations, guidelines, corporate governance practice and disclosure requirements, administrative actions and policies in each jurisdiction in which it operates, which represents ongoing compliance and conduct risks.

NatWest Group expects government and regulatory intervention in the financial services industry to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn recent years, regulators and governments have focused on reforming the prudential regulation of the financial services industry and the manner in which the business of financial services is conducted. Measures have included: enhanced capital, liquidity and funding requirements, implementation of the UK ring-fencing regime, implementation and strengthening of the recovery and resolution framework applicable to financial institutions in the UK, the EU and the US, financial industry reforms (including in respect of MiFID II), corporate governance requirements, restrictions on the compensation of senior management and other employees, enhanced data protection and IT resilience requirements, financial market infrastructure reforms (including enhanced data protection and IT resilience requirements) enhanced regulations in respect of the provision of 'investment services and activities', and increased regulatory focus in certain areas, including conduct, consumer protection, competition and disputes regimes, anti-money laundering, anticorruption, anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion,\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n423\n\npayment systems, sanctions and antiterrorism laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, there is significant oversight by competition authorities of the jurisdictions in which NatWest Group operates. The competitive landscape for banks and other financial institutions in the UK, EU/EEA, Asia and the US is rapidly changing. Recent regulatory and legal changes have and may continue to result in new market participants and changed competitive dynamics in certain key areas. Regulatory and competition authorities, including the CMA, are currently also looking at and focusing more on how they can support competition and innovation in digital and other markets. Recent regulatory changes, proposed (such as US proposals to increase regulation around cybersecurity) or future developments and heightened levels of public and regulatory scrutiny in the UK, the EU and the US have resulted in increased capital, funding and liquidity requirements, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in other regulatory requirements and increased operating costs, and have impacted, and will continue to impact, product offerings and business models.\n\nOther areas in which, and examples of where, governmental policies, regulatory and accounting changes, and increased public and regulatory scrutiny could have an adverse effect (some of which could be material) on NatWest Group include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \uf02d general changes in government, central bank, regulatory or competition policy, or changes in regulatory regimes that may influence investor decisions in the jurisdictions in which NatWest Group operates;\n- \uf02d rules relating to foreign ownership, expropriation, nationalisation and confiscation of assets;\n- \uf02d increased scrutiny including from the CMA, FCA and Payment Systems Regulator ('PSR') for the protection and resilience of, and competition and innovation in, digital and other markets, UK payment systems and retail banking developments relating to the UK initiative on Open Banking, Open Finance and the European directive on payment services;\n- \uf02d the ongoing compliance by NatWest Group with CMA's Market Orders including the Retail Banking Market Order 2017 (the 'Order') and SME Undertakings as well as the ongoing consultation by the UK Government to introduce penalties for breaches of such requirements (in addition to the current customer remediation requirements);\n- \uf02d ongoing competition litigation in the English courts around payment card interchange fees, combined with increased regulatory scrutiny (from the PSR) of the Visa and Mastercard card schemes;\n- \uf02d increased risk of new class action claims being brought against NatWest Group in the Competition Appeal Tribunal for breaches of competition law;\n- \uf02d new or increased regulations relating to customer data protection as well as IT controls and resilience, such as the proposed UK Data Protection and Digital Information Bill and in India, the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill;\n\n\uf02d\n\n- the introduction of, and changes to, taxes, levies or fees applicable to NatWest Group's operations, such as the imposition of a financial transaction tax, introduction of global minimum tax rules, changes in tax rates, changes in the scope and administration of the Bank Levy, increases in the bank corporation tax surcharge in the UK, restrictions on the tax deductibility of interest payments or further restrictions imposed on the treatment of carryforward tax losses that reduce the value of deferred tax assets and require increased payments of tax;\n- \uf02d increased regulatory focus on customer protection (such as the FCA's Consumer Duty policy statement and final rules and guidance) in retail or other financial markets;\n- \uf02d the potential introduction by the Bank of England of a Central Bank Digital Currency which could result in deposit outflows, higher funding costs, and/or other implications for UK banks including NatWest Group; and\n- \uf02d regulatory enforcement in the form of PRA imposed financial penalties for failings in banks' regulatory reporting governance and controls, and regulatory scrutiny following the 2019 PRA 'Dear CEO letter' regarding PRA's ongoing focus on: the integrity of regulatory reporting, which the PRA considers has equal standing with financial reporting; the PRA's thematic reviews of the governance, controls and processes for preparing regulatory returns of selected UK banks, including NatWest Group; the publication of the PRA's common findings from those reviews in September 2021; and NatWest Group's programme of improvements to meet PRA expectations.",

        "page_content": "These and other recent regulatory changes, proposed or future developments and heightened levels of public and regulatory scrutiny in the UK, the EU and the US have resulted in increased capital, funding and liquidity requirements, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in other regulatory requirements and increased operating costs, and have impacted, and will continue to impact, competitive position, product offerings and business models. Future competition investigations, market reviews, or the regulation of mergers may lead to the imposition of financial penalties or market remedies that may adversely affect NatWest Group's competitive or financial position. Any of these developments (including any failure to comply with new rules and regulations) could also have a significant impact on NatWest Group's authorisations and licences, the products and services that NatWest Group may offer, its reputation and the value of its assets, NatWest Group's operations or legal entity structure, and the manner in which NatWest Group conducts its business. Material consequences could arise should NatWest Group be found to be non-compliant with these regulatory requirements. Regulatory developments may also result in an increased number of regulatory investigations and proceedings and have increased the risks relating to NatWest Group's ability to comply with the applicable body of rules and regulations in the manner and within the timeframes required.\n\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement, or the implementation of new laws, rules or regulations, including contradictory or conflicting laws, rules or regulations by key regulators or policymakers in different jurisdictions, or failure by NatWest Group to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, may adversely affect NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook. In addition, uncertainty and insufficient international regulatory coordination as enhanced supervisory standards are developed and implemented may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to engage in effective business, capital and risk management planning.\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to the risks of various litigation matters, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations as well as remedial undertakings, including conduct-related reviews, antimoney laundering and redress projects, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, and which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are diverse and complex and it operates in legal and\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nregulatory environments that expose it to potentially significant civil actions (including those following on from regulatory sanction), as well as criminal, regulatory and governmental proceedings. NatWest Group has resolved a number of legal and regulatory actions over the past several years but continues to be, and may in the future be, involved in such actions in the US, the UK, Europe and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group is currently, has recently been and will likely be involved in a number of significant legal and regulatory actions, including investigations, proceedings and ongoing reviews (both formal and informal) by governmental law enforcement and other agencies and litigation proceedings, including in relation to the offering of securities, conduct in the foreign exchange market, the setting of benchmark rates such as LIBOR and related derivatives trading, the issuance, underwriting, and sales and trading of fixed-income securities (including government securities), product misselling, customer mistreatment, antimoney laundering, antitrust, VAT recovery and various other issues. Legal and regulatory actions are subject to many uncertainties, and their outcomes, including the timing, amount of fines, damages or settlements or the form of any settlements, which may be material and in excess of any related provisions, are often difficult to predict, particularly in the early stages of a case or investigation. NatWest Group's expectation for resolution may change and substantial additional provisions and costs may be recognised in respect of any matter.\n\nThe resolution of significant investigations include: NWM Plc's December 2021 spoofing-related guilty plea in the United States, which involves a three-year period of probation, an independent corporate monitor, and commitments to compliance programme reviews and improvements and reporting obligations. For additional information relating to this and other legal and regulatory proceedings and matters to which NatWest Group is currently exposed, see ' Litigation and regulatory matters ' at Note 26 to the consolidated accounts.\n\nThe 2021 guilty plea, other recently resolved matters or adverse outcomes or resolution of current or future legal or regulatory actions could increase the risk of greater regulatory and third-party scrutiny and could have material collateral consequences for NatWest Group's business and result in restrictions or limitations on NatWest Group's operations.\n\n424\n\nThese may include the effective or actual disqualification from carrying on certain regulated activities and consequences resulting from the need to reapply for various important licences or obtain waivers to conduct certain existing activities of NatWest Group, particularly but not solely in the US, which may take a significant period of time and the results and implications of which are uncertain.\n\nDisqualification from carrying on any activities, whether automatically as a result of the resolution of a particular matter or as a result of the failure to obtain such licences or waivers could adversely affect NatWest Group's business, in particular in the US. This in turn and/or any fines, settlement payments or penalties may adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation, future results, financial condition and/or prospects.\n\nFailure to comply with undertakings made by NatWest Group to its regulators, or the conditions of probation resulting from the spoofing-related guilty plea, may result in additional measures or penalties being taken against NatWest Group. In addition, any failure to administer conduct redress processes adequately, or to handle individual complaints fairly or appropriately, could result in further claims as well as the imposition of additional measures or limitations on NatWest Group's operations, additional supervision by NatWest Group's regulators, and loss of investor confidence.\n\nNatWest Group may not effectively manage the transition of LIBOR and other IBOR rates to replacement riskfree rates.\n\nUK and international regulators are driving the transition from the use of interbank offer rates ('IBORs'), to replacement rates generally referred to as 'risk-free rates' ('RFRs'). As of 31 December 2021, LIBOR, as currently determined, has ceased for all tenors of GBP, JPY, CHF, EUR, and for the 1 week and 2-month tenors for USD. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors, as currently determined, are due to cease after 30 June 2023. The FCA has used its powers under the UK Benchmarks Regulation ('UK BMR') to require, for a limited period of time after 31 December 2021, the ongoing publication of the 1-, 3-, and 6-month GBP and JPY LIBOR tenors using a changed methodology (i.e., 'Art23A LIBOR' on a synthetic basis). The UK has passed the Critical Benchmarks (References and Administrators' Liability)\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAct 2021 ('Critical Benchmarks Act') which establishes a framework that allows the ongoing use of Art23A LIBOR under certain circumstances where contracts have not pro-actively transitioned onto the replacement rates. These concessions provided under UK BMR and the Critical Benchmarks Act are temporary. The FCA confirmed that Art23A will no longer be available from: (i) the end of 2022 for JPY, (ii) March 2023 for 1- and 6-month GBP LIBOR and (iii) March 2024 for 3-month GBP LIBOR. The transition away from these temporary concessions may expose NatWest Group, its customers and the financial services industry more widely to various risks, including: (i) the FCA further restricting use of Art23A LIBOR resulting in proactive transition of contracts; and (ii) mis-matches between positions in cleared derivatives and the exposures they are hedging where those exposures are permitted to make use of Art23A LIBOR. Although the formal cessation date for the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (as currently determined) is not until the end of June 2023, US and UK regulators have clarified that this is only to support the rundown of existing USD LIBOR exposures. No new contracts should reference these USD LIBOR tenors after 31 December 2021, other than in a very limited range of circumstances. NatWest Group will continue to have ongoing exposure to the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until cessation in June 2023.\n\nNatWest Group has held significant exposures to various IBORs and has actively sought to transition away from these during 2021 and 2022 in accordance with regulatory expectations and milestones. Transition measures have included the pro-active development of new products using the replacement rates, restructuring existing LIBOR exposures to reference these replacement rates and embedding RFR transition language into relevant contracts. Central Counterparty Clearing houses (CCPs) conducted mass conversion exercises in December 2021 covering GBP, JPY, CHF and EUR LIBOR, transitioning derivatives to the relevant RFR, conversion exercises for USD are scheduled for May 2023. NWG entities, along with many of their major counterparties, have adhered to the ISDA IBOR fall-backs protocol which\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n425\n\nestablishes a contractual process to transition from IBORs to RFRs for bilateral derivative products.\n\nThese transition efforts have involved extensive engagement with customers, industry working groups and regulators to seek to deliver transition in a transparent and economically appropriate manner. These changes coincide with the recognition that market liquidity is lower than it has been and whilst it will be inherently difficult to disaggregate the different impacts from each other it may be that similar levels of market liquidity are not reached for these RFR products, clear and consistent market conventions for all replacement products may not be implemented or they may not be accepted by market participants including NatWest Group counterparties. Where there remains an uncertainty around the manner of transition to RFRs, NatWest Group, clients and the financial services industry are exposed to the related risks.\n\nExamples of these risks include (i) legal (including litigation) risks relating to documentation for new and the majority of existing transactions (including, changes, lack of changes, unclear contractual provisions, and disputes in respect of these); (ii) financial risks from any changes in valuation of financial instruments linked to relevant IBORs, including cost of funds and relevant risk management related financial models; (iii) changes to benchmark rates could impact pricing, interest rate or settlement mechanisms for certain instruments; (iv) operational risks linked to the adaptation of IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes, as well as ensuring compliance with restrictions on new USD LIBOR usage after December 2021; (v) conduct risks arising from communication of the potential impact on customers, engagement with customers during and after the transition period, or non-acceptance by customers of replacement rates; and (vi) different legislative provisions in different jurisdictions, for example, unlike certain US states and the EU, the UK has not provided a clear and robust safe harbour to protect against litigation and potential liability arising out of the switch to 'synthetic LIBOR'.\n\nAlthough the majority of NWG's IBOR exposure has already been transitioned to RFRs, there remains a large population linked to USD LIBOR, scheduled for transition by June 2023. Until IBOR transition is complete there is some uncertainty as to the impact of the transition, or the potential costs of implementing any relevant remedial action including in the event that the transition is not completed in a timely manner, or at all. The implementation of any alternative RFRs may be impossible or impracticable under the existing terms of certain financial instruments and may adversely affect their value or return and therefore on NatWest Group's future results.\n\nChanges in tax legislation or failure to generate future taxable profits may impact the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets recognised by NatWest Group.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting policies set out in 'Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty ', NatWest Group has recognised deferred tax assets on losses available to relieve future profits from tax only to the extent it is probable that they will be recovered. The deferred tax assets are quantified on the basis of current tax legislation and accounting standards and are subject to change in respect of the future rates of tax or the rules for computing taxable profits and offsetting allowable losses.\n\nFailure to generate sufficient future taxable profits or further changes in tax legislation (including with respect to rates of tax) or accounting standards may reduce the recoverable amount of the recognised tax loss deferred tax assets, amounting to \u00a32,178 million as at 31 December 2022. Changes to the treatment of certain deferred tax assets may impact NatWest Group's capital position. In addition, NatWest Group's interpretation or application of relevant tax laws may differ from those of the relevant tax authorities and provisions are made for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities. The amounts ultimately paid may differ materially from the amounts provided depending on the ultimate resolution of such matters.",

Material contracts include the following:\n\n## B Share Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement\n\nOn 26 November 2009, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement pursuant to which HM Treasury subscribed for the initial B shares and the Dividend Access Share (the Acquisitions) and agreed the terms of HM Treasury's contingent subscription (the Contingent Subscription) for an additional \u00a38 billion in aggregate in the form of further B shares (the Contingent B shares), to be issued on the same terms as the initial B shares. The Acquisitions were subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the company having obtained the approval of its shareholders in relation to the Acquisitions.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the company announced that, having received approval from the PRA, it had terminated the \u00a38 billion Contingent Subscription. The company was able to cancel the Contingent Subscription as a result of the actions announced in the second half of 2013 to further strengthen its capital position.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the company announced that on 8 October 2015, it had received a valid conversion notice from HM Treasury in respect of all outstanding B shares held by HM Treasury. The new ordinary shares issued on conversion of the B shares were admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority (UKLA), and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc, on 14 October 2015. Following such conversion, HM Treasury no longer holds any B shares.\n\nThe company gave certain representations and warranties to HM Treasury on the date of the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement, on the date the circular was posted to shareholders, on the first date on which all of the conditions precedent were satisfied, or waived, and on the date of the Acquisitions. The company also agreed to a number of undertakings.\n\nThe company agreed to reimburse HM Treasury for its expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions.\n\nFor as long as it is a substantial shareholder of the company (within the meaning of the UKLA's Listing Rules), HM Treasury has undertaken not to vote on related party transaction resolutions\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nat general meetings and to direct that its affiliates do not so vote\n\n## Directed Buyback Contract\n\nOn 7 February 2019, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Directed Buyback Contract to help facilitate the return of the company to full private ownership through the use of any excess capital to buy back the company's ordinary shares held by HM Treasury.\n\nUnder the terms of the Directed Buyback Contract, the company may agree with HM Treasury to make off-market purchases from time to time of its ordinary shares held by HM Treasury, including by way of one or more standalone purchases, through a nondiscretionary, broker-managed directed trading programme, or in conjunction with any offer or sale by HM Treasury by way of an institutional placing. Neither the company nor HM Treasury would be under an obligation to agree to make such off-market purchases and would only do so subject to regulatory approval at the time.\n\nThe aggregate number of ordinary shares which the company may purchase from HM Treasury under the Directed Buyback Contract will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's issued share capital and the aggregate consideration to be paid will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's market capitalisation. The price to be paid for each ordinary share will be the market price at the time of purchase or, if the directed buyback is in conjunction with an institutional placing, the placing price.\n\nTo date, the company has made two separate off-market purchases under the Directed Buyback Contract. One purchase took place in 2021, and another took place in 2022.\n\nOn 19 March 2021, the company announced that it had agreed with HM Treasury to make an off-market purchase under the Directed Buyback Contract for the total consideration of \u00a31,125,341,269 for 590,730,325 ordinary shares representing 4.86% of the company's issued share capital at that point in time.\n\nThe following year, on 28 March 2022, the company announced an additional off-market purchase of 549,851,147 ordinary shares for the total consideration of \u00a31,212,421,779. The purchased ordinary shares represented 4.91% of the company's issued share capital at the time (excluding treasury shares). This took HM Treasury's ownership in the company below 50% for the first time since 2008.\n\n426\n\n## Framework and State Aid Deed\n\nAs a result of the State Aid granted to the company, it was required to work with HM Treasury to submit a State Aid restructuring plan to the European Commission (EC), which was then approved by the EC under the State Aid rules on 14 December 2009. The company agreed a series of measures which supplemented the measures in the company's strategic plan.\n\nThe company entered into a State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury at the time of the initial EC decision and, following the EC's approval of amendments to the restructuring plan in April 2014, the company entered into a revised State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury. In September 2017, the revised State Aid Commitment Deed was amended by a Deed of Variation (as so amended, the 'Revised State Aid Commitment Deed') following the EC's approval of an alternative remedies package (the 'Alternative Remedies Package') to replace the company's final outstanding commitment under its State Aid obligations (to divest the business previously known as Williams & Glyn).\n\nOn 25 April 2018, the Revised State Aid Commitment Deed was replaced by the Framework and State Aid Deed between the company, HM Treasury and an independent body established to facilitate and oversee the delivery of the Alternative Remedies Package (the 'Independent Body'). Under the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company agrees to do all acts and things necessary to ensure that HM Treasury is able to comply with its obligations under any EC decision approving State Aid to the company, including under the Alternative Remedies Package.\n\nPursuant to the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company has committed: (i) \u00a3425 million into a fund for eligible bodies in the UK banking and financial technology sectors to develop and improve their capability to compete with the company in the provision of banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and develop and improve the financial products and services available to SMEs (the 'Capability and Innovation Fund'); and (ii) \u00a3275 million to eligible bodies to help them incentivise SME banking customers within the division of the company previously known as Williams & Glyn to switch their business current accounts and loans to the eligible bodies (the 'Incentivised Switching Scheme').\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Material contracts continued\n\nThe company has also agreed to set aside up to a further \u00a375 million in funding to cover certain costs customers may incur as a result of switching under the Incentivised Switching Scheme. In addition, under the terms of the Alternative Remedies Package, should the uptake within the Incentivised Switching Scheme not be sufficient, the company may be required to make a further contribution, capped at \u00a350 million. The Independent Body will distribute funds from the Capability and Innovation Fund and implement the Incentivised Switching Scheme.\n\nUnder the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company also agreed to indemnify the Independent Body and HM Treasury, up to an amount of \u00a3320 million collectively to cover liabilities that may be incurred in implementing the Alternative Remedies Package. The provisions of the indemnity to the Independent Body are set out in the Framework and State Aid Deed and the provisions of the indemnity to HM Treasury are set out in a separate agreement between the company and HM Treasury, described under ' Deed of Indemnity ' below.\n\nThe Framework and State Aid Deed also provides that if the EC adopts a decision that the UK Government must recover any State Aid (a \"Repayment Decision\") and the recovery order of the Repayment Decision has not been annulled or suspended by the General Court or the European Court of Justice, then the company must repay HM Treasury any aid ordered to be recovered under the Repayment Decision.\n\n## Deed of Indemnity\n\nIn the context of the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company entered into a Deed of Indemnity with HM Treasury on 25 April 2018, pursuant to which the company agreed to indemnify HM Treasury to cover liabilities that may be incurred in implementing the Alternative Remedies Package, as described under 'Framework and State Aid Deed' above .\n\n## Trust Deed\n\nIn the context of the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company entered into a Trust Deed with the Independent Body on 25 April 2018, to set up a trust to administer the funds committed by the company under the Framework and State Aid Deed for the Alternative Remedies Package.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\n\n427\n\n## State Aid Costs Reimbursement Deed\n\nUnder the 2009 State Aid Costs Reimbursement Deed, the company has agreed to reimburse HM Treasury for fees, costs and expenses associated with the State Aid and State Aid approval.\n\n## HMT and UKFI Relationship Deed\n\nOn 7 November 2014, in order to comply with an amendment to the UK Listing Rules, the company entered into a Relationship Deed with HM Treasury and UK Financial Investments Limited in relation to the company's obligations under the UK Listing Rules to put in place an agreement with any controlling shareholder (as defined for these purposes in the Listing Rules). The Relationship Deed covers the three independence provisions mandated by the Listing Rules: (i) that contracts between the company and HM Treasury (or any of its subsidiaries) will be arm's length and normal commercial arrangements, (ii) that neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect of preventing the company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and (iii) neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Memorandum of Understanding Relating to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund\n\nOn 16 April 2018 the company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the 'MoU') with the trustee of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund (the 'Group Fund'), which aimed to facilitate both the necessary changes to the Main Section of the Group Fund to align the employing entity structure with the requirements of the UK ring-fencing legislation and acceleration of the settlement framework for the 31 December 2017 triennial valuation of the Main Section of the Group Fund (brought forward from 31 December 2018).\n\nIn addition, the MoU also provided clarity on the additional related funding contributions required to be made by the company to the Main Section of the Group Fund as follows: (i) a pre-tax payment of \u00a32 billion that was made in the second half of 2018 and (ii) from 1 January 2020, further pre-tax contributions of up to \u00a31.5 billion in aggregate linked to the making of future distributions to RBS shareholders including ordinary and special dividends and/or share buy backs (subject to an annual cap on contributions of \u00a3500 million before tax).\n\n## Framework Agreement Relating to the NatWest Group Pension Fund\n\nOn 28 September 2018 the company entered into a framework agreement (the 'Framework Agreement') with the trustee ('Trustee') of the NatWest Group Pension Fund (the 'Group Fund'). Amongst others, the Framework Agreement set out the funding contributions required to be made by the company to the Main Section of the Group Fund as follows: (i) a pre-tax payment of \u00a32 billion that was made in the second half of 2018 and (ii) from 1 January 2020, further pre-tax contributions of up to \u00a31.5 billion in aggregate linked to the making of future distributions to NatWest Group shareholders including ordinary and special dividends and/or share buy backs (subject to an annual cap on contributions of \u00a3471 million before tax). Pursuant to funding requirements in the Framework Agreement, the company made contributions to the Main Section of the Group Fund in an aggregate amount of \u00a3500m in 2021 and \u00a3500m in 2022.\n\nOn 6 February 2023, the company and the Trustee entered into an amendment to the Framework Agreement, a supplemental framework agreement and a revised Schedule of Contributions to, among others, restructure the requirement to make a distribution-linked contribution to the Main Section of the Group Fund of up to \u00a3500 million (before tax) in 2023. In place of this requirement, the company and the Trustee agreed to establish a bankruptcy remote reservoir trust to hold assets with a value equivalent to \u00a3471 million under the continuing control of the company. These assets would become transferrable to the Main Section of the Group Fund in the event that specified payment triggers, reflecting a funding requirement, were met in two consecutive financial years.",

They use increasingly sophisticated tactics to approach investors, offering to buy or sell shares, often pressuring investors to make a quick decision or miss out on the deal. Contact can also be in the form of email, post or word of mouth. Scams are sometimes advertised in newspapers, magazines or online as genuine investment opportunities and may offer free gifts or discounts on dealing charges.\n\nScammers will request money upfront, as a bond or other form of security, but victims are often left out of pocket, sometimes losing their savings or even their family home. Even seasoned investors have been caught out by scams.\n\n## C Clloonnee  ffiirrmmss\n\nA 'clone firm' uses the name, firm registration number (FRN) and address of a firm or individual who is FCA authorised. The scammer may claim that the genuine firm's contact details on the FCA Register (Register) are out of date and then use their own details, or copy the website of an authorised firm, making subtle changes such as the phone number. They may claim to be an overseas firm, which won't always have full contact and website details listed on the Register.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## H Hooww  ttoo  pprrootteecctt  yyoouurrsseellff\n\nAlways be wary if you're contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly, or promised returns that sound too good to be true.

These judgements, assumptions and estimates are highly likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the longer time frames used in these disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain. In addition, our climate risk analysis, net zero strategy, including the implementation of our climate transition plan remain under development, and the data underlying our analysis and strategy remain subject to evolution over time. The process we have adopted to define, gather and report data on our performance on climate and ESG measures is not subject to the formal processes adopted for financial reporting in accordance with IFRS and there are currently limited industry standards or globally recognised established practices for measuring and defining climate and ESG related metrics. As a result, we expect that certain climate and ESG disclosures made in this document are likely to be amended, updated, recalculated or restated in the future. Please also refer to the cautionary statement in the section entitled 'Climate-related and other forward-looking statements and metrics' of the NatWest Group 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n## C Caauuttiioonnaarryy  ssttaatteemmeenntt  rreeggaarrddiinngg  NNoonn--IIFFRRSS  ffiinnaanncciiaall  mmeeaassuurreess  aanndd  AAPPMMss\n\nNatWest Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
