This exemplifies the resilience of the organisation and our collective drive to deliver long term sustainable results through the execution of our strategy. The growth delivered was further re-affirmation of our positioning as a market leader in the industry, meeting our customers' needs to enhance the nutrition, wellness and functionality of their products in a way that protects people and the environment around us without compromising on taste.\n\n## 50 th Anniversary\n\nIn 2022, Kerry celebrated its 50 th anniversary. Across the world, employees engaged in activities with customers, local communities and each other to mark this milestone anniversary with pride. Through these celebrations, the Board recognised that Kerry's values, energy and passion, part of our DNA from our earliest days in 1972, continue to drive the business today. 50 years on, the values of courage, enterprising spirit, inclusiveness, ownership and open-mindedness are alive, and the collective ambition of our employees, customers and suppliers to do better for people and the planet is stronger than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic Update\n\n2022 is the first year of the Group's refreshed strategic plan and the management team has made a successful start implementing the growth strategies.\n\nThe Group completed four acquisitions during the year as Kerry continues to evolve its portfolio to strengthen our position as a world-leading taste and nutrition company. Since year end the Group announced the potential sale of its Sweet Ingredients Portfolio. This portfolio repositioning is another important development in Kerry's strategic evolution.\n\nThe Group will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities aligned with the Group's strategic priorities and key growth platforms.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Group's 2030 Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy underpins Kerry's future growth as we continue to partner with our customers across the globe to create a world of sustainable nutrition.\n\nThe Board, through the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, contributed to, reviewed and approved the significant sustainability developments actioned in 2022 as we help our\n\ncustomers create healthier, more nutritious products that taste great in a way that protects people and the environment around us. One of those actions was the launch of our Evolve Dairy Sustainability Programme, which supports the accelerated adoption of sciencebased sustainable actions and best practice on the farms of our Irish suppliers. Refer to the Sustainability Review on pages 70 and 73 for further details.\n\nThe 2022 Sustainability Report published alongside the Annual Report details the Group's progress against its sustainability strategy and targets in reference to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.\n\nDetails regarding the Group's sustainability strategy, targets, performance, policies and programmes are outlined in the Sustainability Review on pages 5293 and in the 2022 Sustainability Report, which is available on kerry.com.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board is firmly committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance in line with best practice.

Further details of our stakeholder engagement activities are outlined on pages 122-125.\n\nEach year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its effectiveness and that of its Committees. In 2022 the evaluation was externally facilitated and the outcome of this review is that the Board and its Committees consider that they are operating effectively.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nPhilip Toomey retired as Director and Chairman of the Board following the Group's Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022. On behalf of the Board, I wish to pay tribute to Philip for his commitment and dedication to the success of the Group throughout his years of service.\n\nFiona Dawson and Patrick Rohan joined the Board as non-Executive Directors on 4 January 2022 and 16 January 2023 respectively. I look forward to both of them making significant contributions to the Board in the years ahead.\n\nGerard Culligan and Con Murphy retired from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Gerard and Con for their strong contribution over their five years of service.\n\nAs part of the ongoing Board refreshment process, the Governance, Nomination & Sustainability Committee will continue its search for suitable candidates to join the Board in the context of the skillsets required, the Group's diversity commitments, as well as enhanced stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements in relation to Board diversity.\n\n## Purpose and Values\n\nOur Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life , and our Values of Courage, Enterprising Spirit, Inclusiveness, Open-mindedness and Ownership guide our actions and behaviours, keeping us on the right path toward achieving a world of sustainable nutrition.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board has continued to ensure that management promotes our purpose and values to unite the organisation across diverse cultures and geographies. Staying true to our purpose as the organisation has responded to the economic challenges arising from the inflationary environment, which was exacerbated by the invasion of Ukraine, has shown the extraordinary agility, compassion and resilience of our people, operating in difficult circumstances, to do the right thing for our customers, our shareholders, our communities and the environment.\n\n## People and Engagement\n\nCentral to Kerry Group's continued success is the hard work and commitment of all our employees. As the cost of living crisis develops, the Board is overseeing how the Group is actively supporting employees, especially those in lower paid positions, during this period of significantly higher inflation. The Board is also proud of the support provided by the leadership team and employees in general to our Ukrainian colleagues and their families as they have had to deal with the consequences of the invasion in their country.\n\nThe Board also recognises the importance of employee engagement and continues to enhance our employee engagement activities. During 2022, Dr. Karin Dorrepaal, the newly appointed Workforce Engagement Director, engaged in a programme of activities where she had the opportunity to gauge the engagement levels of our people supporting our business, both in-person within our offices and sites and remotely. Details of these activities are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 117-130.\n\n## Operational Visits\n\nAs restrictions eased in 2022, the June 2022 Board meeting was held in the Group's Technology and Innovation Centre in Beloit, USA. The visit afforded Board members the opportunity to meet and engage with key\n\nleaders and emerging talent from the region, to visit two manufacturing sites and observe their process technology capabilities in operation and see first-hand how they have benefited from significant capital investment approved by the Board, and finally to participate in customer immersion experiences that showcased the Group's capabilities in helping customers to solve industry challenges with differentiated solutions.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board recommends a final dividend of 73.4 cent per share (an increase of 10.0% on the 2021 final dividend) payable on 12 May 2023 to shareholders registered on the record date of 14 April 2023.\n\nTogether with the interim dividend of 31.4 cent per share, this brings the total dividend for the year to 104.8 cent, an increase of 10.1% on 2021.\n\n## Prospects\n\nThe Board remains confident that the Group's business model and strategic priorities will continue to deliver shareholder value and benefit our other stakeholders in the years to come. Kerry will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities and the Group's balance sheet is well placed to support our objectives. The view of management regarding the business outlook for 2023 is presented in the Chief Executive Officer's Review.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to sincerely thank Edmond and the Executive Management team for their exceptional leadership and thank everyone throughout the organisation for their contribution to the ongoing success of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTom Moran Chairman 15 February 2023",

These global market challenges also presented opportunities for Kerry, as our teams continued to work closely with our customers and supported them as they navigated through the year. As we managed through this unprecedented inflationary pricing environment, we were very pleased with the resilience of our strong volume growth in Taste & Nutrition and further volume growth in Dairy Ireland.\n\nOverall growth was broad-based across our regions and channels in our food and beverage markets, thanks to a continued strong level of innovation activity.\n\nThis growth was driven by an excellent performance across our range of taste technologies, combined with increased demand from our customers to enhance the nutrition, wellness and functionality of their products. We continued to engage with our customers on enhancing the sustainability profile of their offerings through the year, and we were pleased to see our emerging markets deliver yet another standout year of double-digit volume growth.\n\nWe also continued to make good strategic progress in 2022 with footprint expansion, the initiation of our Accelerate Operational Excellence transformation programme, and further evolution of our portfolio, aligned to our strategic priorities of Taste, Nutrition and Emerging Markets.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to recognise the contribution of our people over the past 50 years of our journey.

Consumers continued to seek new taste experiences, cleaner labels and added functional benefits through food and beverages. The cost-of-living crisis has resulted in many consumers looking for relative value options to meet their purchase preferences, depending on their available resources.\n\nCustomers continued to prioritise the resiliency of their supply chains through this period of inflationary pressure. Innovation has become increasingly targeted, as they seek to meet various consumer preferences at different price ranges. The industry has evolved significantly in recent years, as many of our customers reconfigure aspects of their operations in the face of challenges such as geopolitical volatility, increased regulations and lack of labour availability in certain markets.\n\nThe macroeconomic developments across the year had a substantial effect on interest rates and global equity markets. Share prices and valuations across our sector were significantly adversely impacted, with the effect most acute across growth stocks including Kerry. While the share price performance in the year was disappointing, we have created significant value over many years. We remain intensely focused on delivering against our targets and continuing to strategically evolve our business, which we believe will deliver long-term shareholder return.\n\n## Our Performance\n\nIn the year we delivered strong overall growth, with Group reported revenue increasing by 19.3% to \u20ac8.8 billion, driven primarily by volume growth of 6.1% and pricing of 11.7%. Group EBITDA increased by 12.9% to \u20ac1.2 billion, representing an EBITDA margin of 13.9%. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7.3% in constant currency, while free cash flow increased to \u20ac640m.\n\nWe also made good progress in 2022 on our Beyond the Horizon sustainability journey. Under Better for People, we increased our nutritional reach with positive and balanced nutrition solutions to 1.2 billion people, as we continue to work with our customers to improve the nutritional profile of their products.\n\nUnder Better for Society, we made important steps on our health and safety performance. We also rolled out a range of programmes to support our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging objectives and continued to support those communities most in need, through our employee programmes and partnerships with leading NGOs.\n\nUnder Better for the Planet, we delivered a 48% reduction in carbon, as we accelerated our shift towards renewable electricity. We also made significant progress across a number of other measures, including reducing food waste by 32% across our operations. We are pleased with our progress to date, while recognising the challenges ahead for our industry and the need to intensify our efforts, as we continue to create a world of sustainable nutrition.",

Growth in LATAM remained strong across both Mexico and Brazil.\n\nEurope delivered strong volume growth of 6.2% given the economic backdrop in the region. Growth was driven by the Snacks, Dairy and Meals end use markets. This growth was broad-based across the region, with the exception of Eastern Europe, where we made the decision to exit Russia and Belarus post the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe APMEA region achieved volume growth of 8.1%, which represented a very strong performance given the challenging conditions in China through the year. This growth was led by the Snacks, Meat and Bakery end use markets. Our performance in the region was particularly strong across the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\n## Forward Looking Statement\n\nThe Group began its 2022-2026 strategic cycle with a strong year of growth, good overall financial performance and continued progress against Kerry's Beyond the Horizon sustainability commitments.\n\nAt the outset of 2023, while market conditions are currently uncertain, Kerry remains strongly positioned for growth ahead of its markets. The Group will continue to manage input cost fluctuations with its well-established pricing model. Kerry will continue to invest capital aligned to its strategic priorities and strategically evolve its portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEdmond Scanlon Chief Executive Officer 15 February 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDairy Ireland delivered strong organic growth in the year, reflecting a significant level of pricing.

Events ranged from local team building activities, charity donations and town halls to commemorative plaques, globally-led Inspiring People awards anchored around our Kerry values and new community partnerships, including numerous opportunities to connect with family, customers, and former employees.\n\nA common theme across all our celebrations was the opportunity to feature and enjoy our innovative Kerry taste and nutrition solutions from around the world, reinforcing our purpose to inspire food and nourish life.\n\n## Our Values\n\nOur values are inspired by our purpose. They underpin the culture we continue to cultivate and develop to sustain our success. They unite us across our diverse cultures and geographies, providing a guiding framework for building trust and mutual respect through the engagement of our people, our customers and our communities. They represent strengths from our heritage as well as new capabilities, which we want to collectively embed across our expanding global footprint. Our leaders continue to prioritise how they role model our values in action, each and every day, across all areas of Kerry.\n\nReflecting the essence of our values, we empower our people to have the courage to challenge the status quo when it poses a risk to progress, and to express their unique perspectives. We ask our people to consider the art of the possible, and to bring new and innovative ideas to how we do our work. We encourage all our people to have the courage to speak up and integrity is non-negotiable.\n\nIn turn, Kerry commits to listening.

We view the engagement of our people as a lead indicator of our future sustainable business growth and performance and invest our collective energy in nurturing and enhancing the engagement of all teams across the globe.\n\nEach year, the needs of our people and our business change and evolve. To ensure we are providing the right support and the best employee experience, we regularly pulse-check our employee engagement and take action on the feedback we receive from our people. We have a stated ambition of being a top quartile employer for employee engagement, and through our continuous listening strategy and frequent monitoring, we are pleased with our continued progress against that ambition.\n\nIn 2022, we completed our global employee engagement survey for the fourth year running. We are particularly proud of our participation rate of 92% across all our regions and functions. This demonstrates the trust and willingness of our people to share their voice.\n\n## PILLAR 1 MAKING IT BETTER\n\n## PILLAR 2 MAKING IT CLEARER\n\n## PILLAR 3 MAKING IT EASIER\n\nMaking it Better encompasses the actions that impact the working life of everyone at Kerry. Learning and development opportunities, our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging agenda, wellbeing and reward and recognition initiatives all fall under this pillar. Through the survey feedback in 2022, our people shared that they have experienced positive developments in all these areas. Further details on actions we have taken in these areas are covered in our later sections focused on Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Leadership and Talent and Rewards and Recognition.\n\nMaking it Clearer covers aspects relating to Kerry's vision, brand and strategy. Following our strategy refresh in 2021, Kerry's senior leadership team invested considerable time and effort throughout 2022 in ensuring that every individual at Kerry understands our strategic objectives and how their role contributes to Kerry's longterm goals. The refresh of Kerry.com was a major milestone in our 2022 brand agenda. This resource is available for all Kerry stakeholders, including Kerry employees, to better understand the vast scope of products and services we provide to our valued customers.\n\nMaking it Easier is a hugely important pillar for Kerry. Our relentless drive to work smarter is core to the culture at Kerry. Through our Accelerate Operational Excellence Transformation programme, we are continuing to realise ongoing benefits, with specific focus on performance and delivery across our plant network. In addition, we are further enhancing the portfolio and scope of our Global Business Services organisation, making it easier for our people to access the support they need, when they need it in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nIt demonstrates that our people see value in sharing their feedback, which is used as key input in helping to make Kerry a better and more successful business for the future.\n\nThis year we aligned our engagement focus areas under three pillars: 'Making it Better, Making it Clearer and Making it Easier'. These three pillars will guide how we approach our engagement action planning across Kerry and focus our efforts on improving the working experience for our people.\n\nDuring 2022, the role of designated Workforce Engagement Director transitioned from Mr. Tom Moran to Dr. Karin Dorrepaal, who participated in numerous employee engagement activities throughout the year. This important role ensures the employee's voice is considered and represented by the Board when making decisions impacting our people, ensuring we are confident that we are making the right decisions for Kerry overall.\n\nActivities this year included an opportunity to join the panel for Kerry's Flagship Pride webinar 'Together with Pride - A Womxn's Perspective' and a number of manufacturing plant visits to engage with our teams in Europe and North America. Dr. Dorrepaal continues to champion and help us shape Kerry's engagement strategy, ensuring we are bringing industry-best practices and giving due consideration to the external environment within which Kerry operates.

Through the survey feedback in 2022, we have seen this focused effort lead to markedly increased engagement across all plant leaders who have been through the programme. Their plant teams also had, on average, improved engagement scores, as compared to the previous year's survey. This shows that the investment in our plant population is being felt, and the programme is making it better, clearer and easier to work at Kerry.\n\nWe continue to support our leaders to shape our workplace for the future, listen to their teams, and implement robust action plans for continuous improvement based on two-way dialogue. We saw continued improvement in our people's experience of their people leaders' effectiveness in our 2022 survey. We have seen that positive engagement levels of individual people leaders make a significant positive impact on the engagement of their team and we will continue our priority focus and investment in our people leaders' skills and behaviours.\n\nFollowing the launch of our Inclusion Index as an integral part of our 2021 employee engagement survey, we were delighted to see an improvement across all elements of the index in 2022. Our most positive feedback through the index is centred around Trust - which references our approach to fostering open and honest communications and how respected our people feel. This is core to building inclusivity in organisations and is the basis for all other aspects of the Inclusion Index: Fair Treatment, Psychological Safety, Integrating Differences and Belonging. We will bring insights from the Inclusion Index into our 2023 Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging plans, ensuring we continue to evolve and drive progress in this important space.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We celebrate and harness our diversity to drive business performance and foster a healthy and inclusive environment that enables our people to be at their best and continue to drive positive change at a systemic level, both structurally and behaviourally.\n\nDuring 2022, we embarked on a detailed planning exercise with representatives from each region, to agree a strategic roadmap for each region in pursuit of our shared 2030 goals. Key areas of focus include continuing to build diverse and inclusive leadership, promoting greater depth and breadth in our talent pipelines, embedding our agile working practices, encouraging employee-led initiatives, engaging with aligned external partners and confirming Executive Leadership Team sponsorship for and ownership of our overall Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging ambition. In 2022, we established our Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council, comprising selected members of our Executive Leadership Team. Together with our regional committees, dedicated Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging leads and global taskforce, our Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council will help us to further shape our overall ambition and support our continued progress through 2023.\n\nBuilding on positive feedback received in 2021 during our Inclusive Leadership workshops, we launched an Inclusive Leader toolkit in 2022. This toolkit equips our people leaders with the confidence and capabilities to lead diversity, inclusion and belonging conversations with their teams, making it easier to work together\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto build a more inclusive workplace. Available in 11 languages, it provides practical ideas, templates and tools aligned to our Inclusion Index. In addition, people leaders can self-assess their leadership style and approach across key people processes such as assigning team members to projects, managing flexible working requests and selecting a new team member.\n\nEmbedding a truly inclusive workplace is made possible by our global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging teams working together with our global employee networks - PRYSM, supporting LGBTQI+ colleagues and allies and SEEN, raising awareness and supporting on issues relating to race and social equity. During 2022, PRYSM has continued to work to promote LGBTQI+ rights not only internally, but also in collaboration with Kerry customers and with the broader international community. This year, we saw over 70 of our offices and plants coming together to raise the modern pride flag, in conjunction with customers to celebrate our 50 th anniversary. In 2022, our SEEN network hosted our first global event dedicated to race, ethnicity, cultural and social equity. This focused on raising awareness of topics such as unconscious bias and the impact of privilege, with external experts educating colleagues and many Kerry employees sharing their personal and professional stories and experiences.\n\nWe continue to make positive progress on our gender diversity goals. We set ourselves a goal of achieving equal gender representation in senior management roles by 2030, with women representing 35% of senior leadership roles by 2025. We achieved 36% representation of women in senior management and 33% in senior leadership roles by the end of 2022, and we continue to focus on targeted strategies to accelerate this in 2023. Examples include our new Women in Leadership programme in Europe this year, which we aim to roll out globally to all regions, as well as our Regional Women@Kerry networks, helping to promote opportunities to improve workplace policies and practices for women across Kerry.",

We continue to build our learning technologies, to increase our reach and speed of building capabilities globally.\n\nDuring 2022, we focused on building leadership expertise across our manufacturing facilities, with the launch of a new, targeted Plant Leader Development Programme. With a combination of internal and external expertise, plus peer-to-peer support, this programme aims to build the plant leader skills and behaviours needed for current and future success. Over 70% of the plant leader population are now engaged in the programme and this will continue into 2023, with a focus on following up on results and sustaining behavioural change.\n\nWe also continued our focus on the role of the people leader, recognising the unique role they play in the ongoing performance and engagement of our people. Our refreshed Managing People@Kerry Programme in 2022, underpinned by our Kerry Leadership Competency Framework, is designed to build confidence and competence across all aspects of the role. All newly promoted people leaders are now automatically enrolled into the programme to support the first step in their leadership career. We have also increased the scope of our Virtual Leadership Academy which now engages approximately 1,500 of our people leader population, giving access to timely and relevant thought-leadership\n\ncontent and unique opportunities to engage with leading experts on key topics to build leadership capabilities.\n\nOur functional curriculum supports business growth through enabling the development and application of our foundational technologies and fostering a customer-centric approach. In 2022, the Taste Technical Excellence Programme and Applied Health and Nutrition Technical Excellence Programme brought together subject-matter experts from different areas in the business to share their expertise and support our strategic growth pillars. The overall aim of these programmes has been to further develop expertise and capability in using our new technologies in specific applications, maximising value to customers whilst solidifying foundations for longer term career development of our people.\n\nIn the commercial area, we have been transforming our approach to capability building, whereby teams, including leaders, participate in 'just-in-time' experiential sessions aligned to our commercial campaigns, ensuring newly developed skills and behaviours which can be applied immediately in the role. We continue to enhance our commercial effectiveness programmes, from the onboarding of new team members to programmes that build greater cross-functional collaboration across Kerry.\n\nKerry's early careers programme is a core component of our strategy to strengthen our future pipeline, providing opportunities to develop skills and experience across a wide range of core disciplines, enabling longer-term sustainable leadership for the organisation. We have recently consolidated our graduate programmes globally to create one unified approach for 2023. We have also reviewed our approach this year to apprenticeship programmes in regions and opportunities to expand our offerings in this space, especially for functions within integrated operations in 2023.\n\nWe continue to support development of enterprise initiatives across the group to build capabilities aligned to our strategic objectives. One such example is our Sustainability Essentials programme, launched in 2022, designed to foster a sustainability mindset in all our people, and which is an integral part of all day-to-day activities at Kerry.\n\nFinally, we have continued to strengthen the quality of our leadership talent pipelines through ongoing strategic talent reviews across our regional businesses and global functions. This includes ongoing initiatives to build the quality of our leadership teams, making key strategic appointments as well as continuing to invest in building individual future leaders. We also continue to invest in activities to accelerate succession readiness of identified talent for executive leadership roles, where individuals participate in externally benchmarked assessments, and internally led 360-feedback tools to better target leadership development plans, including access to individual coaching, mentoring and businesss school programmes.",

It encompasses career development, personal growth and access to worldwide opportunities in an inclusive culture where all our people can flourish.\n\nIt supports us in striving to be the first choice for the best talent by providing fair, competitive offerings which our people value and which drive an ownership mindset to achieve Kerry's goals. Our programmes are designed to recognise and reward high performance while nurturing a healthy, diverse workforce by offering choice and flexibility, supporting our people and their families through different life and career stages.\n\nDuring 2022, we implemented the next phase of our Total Rewards roadmap which will continue into 2023. Our aim is to ensure that our reward programmes are positioned as one of the key levers of business performance, are appropriately aligned with the external market, and are delivered in a way which makes them more easily understood and appreciated by our people.\n\nSome examples of enhancements made during 2022, and actions planned for 2023, are as follows:\n\n- During 2022, we undertook a detailed review to design Kerry's first Global All Employee Share Plan which will provide employees the opportunity to become shareholders and allow them to share in the success of the company. The Board and Executive Directors believe that share ownership is a powerful and important way of creating an ownership culture and mindset and as such we will be asking Shareholders to approve this new plan at our 2023 AGM. Further details can be found in the AGM Notice of Meeting, and we intend to implement the plan on a phased basis, commencing in 2023.\n- We are actively engaged with the UK Living Wage Foundation, with the objective of being accredited by them as a UK Living Wage Employer in Q1 2023. In addition, given the increasing global focus on living wage and the associated business, societal and wider economic benefits, we are exploring how we could expand the Living Wage commitment across our wider global footprint from 2023 onwards.\n- We continued to promote and embed our Global Recognition Programme, Inspiring People, which was launched in 2021. Since the plan was launched almost 10,000 Kudos Awards have been made across all regions. We held our first global 'Inspiring People' awards in June.",

This significantly enhances the LTIP experience; driving transparency and understanding, further aligning our participants' experience with that of our shareholders, whilst simplifying and automating how they manage their awards.\n\nIn addition to changes to our global programmes, we made enhancements to local in-country benefit plans, in accordance with our regional and country specific reward roadmaps. We are committed to gender pay equity and continue to proactively monitor the pay of male and female colleagues engaging in similar roles to ensure it is comparable. We appoint and promote based on merit and will continue to encourage the career development of all our people, paying attention to our promotion and recruitment practices with regards to gender, and supporting greater representation of women at all senior management levels in line with our commitments.\n\n## Promoting Health and Wellbeing\n\nWe continue to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our people and we are particularly cognisant of the current economic environment and global inflationary challenges. To support employees through the ongoing cost of living pressures, a number of targeted actions have been taken:\n\n- Country merit budgets are designed to track market movement and are informed by comprehensive market intelligence. Annual salary budgets this year are greater than or equal to last year.\n\n- Greater flexibility in our pay review process to target higher increases for lower paid positions and to give managers greater flexibility to differentiate where pay levels are materially impacted by inflation.\n- Where appropriate, more frequent salary increases were made in countries experiencing hyperinflation.\n- Promotion of employee benefit and discount platforms where available.\n- Global mental wellbeing and financial wellbeing seminars available to all employees.\n\nThrough our wider Wellbeing Framework and commitment, we foster a healthy, positive work environment by providing our people with the physical, emotional, nutritional and financial resources to support them through the various life stages. This is underpinned by a balanced set of programmes, all enabled by a wellbeing centre and toolkit which provides a suite of relevant educational material designed to empower our people to best manage their wellbeing.\n\nWe recognise the critical role family plays in our employees' wellbeing, making sure we have the right level of policies providing flexibility and time away from work to cater for the demands of a busy professional and family life. Every Kerry employee, as well as their family members, has access to our Global Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). EAP is a complimentary, confidential service that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. EAP is run by a team of counsellors, psychologists and work-life consultants who provide expert guidance and specialist support on any kind of issue - from everyday matters to more serious wellbeing problems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consumers are looking for the latest premium taste profiles, while removing sugar, sodium and fat. Improving the sustainability impact of products is an important focus area for all companies, with food waste reduction a key enabler. Consumers continue to favour food and beverage as a means to fulfil their personal holistic health needs, while the importance of affordability has risen, but without any compromise on quality.\n\nThe foodservice channel continues to move at an even faster pace than retail, given how that landscape has evolved over the past number of years. Simplification and improvement of back-of-house operations is a focus, given more challenging labour markets. Larger chains continue to gain market share. Foodservice operators continue to develop their menu offerings to retain their existing customer base and entice new customers, with sustainability, and particularly food waste reduction increasing in importance.",

This was driven primarily from volume growth of 6.1% (2021: 8.0%) and significant price increase of 11.7% (2021: 1.2%) offset by the disposal of the Meats and Meals business in Q4 2021 and the exit of all Group activities in Russia and Belarus.\n\nRevenue in the Taste & Nutrition segment increased by 29.4% from \u20ac5.7bn in 2021 to \u20ac7.4bn . Volume growth represented 7.8% (2021: 8.7%) and this growth was broad-based across all three regions. Price increases of 8.7% (2021: 0.9%) reflect significant input cost increases across all three regions including energy, most notably in Europe.\n\nDairy Ireland revenue, on a reported basis, decreased from \u20ac1.8bn in 2021 to \u20ac1.5bn , driven by the disposal of the Meats and Meals business.

The Group's average cost of finance for the year was 2.3% (2021: 2.7%).\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge for the year before non-trading items was \u20ac114.5m (2021: \u20ac96.2m) representing an effective tax rate of 13.5% (2021: 13.3%) and reflective of the geographical mix of earnings.\n\n## Non-Trading Items\n\nDuring the year, the Group incurred a non-trading charge of \u20ac124.2m (2021: \u20ac134.4m credit) net of tax. The charge in the year primarily related to the impairment of the Group's Russia and Belarus assets and the previously announced Accelerate Operational Excellence transformation programme, which predominantly reflects consultancy fees, project management costs and costs of streamlining operations while we work to enhance our continuous improvement in manufacturing processes and deliver step change manufacturing excellence across the organisation. The credit in the prior year primarily related to the gain on the disposal of the Meats and Meals business, partially offset by costs related to acquisition integration.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nGroup results are impacted by year-on-year fluctuations in exchange rates versus the euro. The primary rates driving the currency impact in the figures above were USD and GBP which had average rates of 1.05 (2021: 1.19) and 0.85 (2021: 0.86) respectively.",

This is further reflected in the overall year on year investment in working capital of \u20ac224m from December 2021 to December 2022. The Group had lower capital expenditure in the year due to timing of projects and the conclusion of a number of significant investments in 2021 including the rollout of KerryConnect in North America.\n\n## Maturity Profile of 2022 Total Net Debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe weighted average maturity of net debt in years is 4.6 .

The bond has a sustainabilitylinked feature that could result in an interest coupon step-up if certain KPI targets are not met, as outlined below, by December 2030.\n\nThe KPIs that have been included in the SLB have been selected as they reflect material environmental sustainability challenges for our industry and key focus areas under our Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy. These KPIs and targets are as follows:\n\nKPI\t1:\t55%\tAbsolute\treduction\tin\tScope\t1\t&\t2\tgreenhouse\tgas\temissions\n\nKPI\t2:\t50%\tFood\twaste\treduction\tacross\tour\toperations\n\n## 2022 Performance\n\nIn 2022, we made continued, strong progress against both targets, delivering a 48% (2021:33%) reduction in our absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions and a 32% (2021:17%) reduction in our food waste volumes, versus a 2017 baseline for both KPIs.\n\n| Emissions (CO2e)     | 2022    | 2017 1   | Food Waste   | 2022   | 2017 1   |\n|----------------------|---------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|\n| Scope 1 & 2 (Tonnes) | 486,146 | 938,001  | Tonnes       | 9,636  | 14,097   |\n| % change             | 48%     |          | % change     | 32%    |          |\n\nFor more details on our progress in reducing emissions and food waste, see our Sustainability Review on page 52 and also our 2022 Sustainability Report at kerry.com.\n\n## Financial Risk Management\n\nWithin the Group risk management framework as described in the Risk Management Report on page 95, the Group has a Financial Risk Management Programme, which is approved by the Board of Directors and is subject to regular monitoring by the Finance Committee and Group Internal Audit. The Group does not engage in speculative trading.\n\nFurther details relating to the Group's financial and compliance risks and their associated mitigation processes are discussed in the Risk Management Report on pages 94-105 and in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividend and Annual General Meeting\n\nDuring the year, the Group paid an interim dividend of 31.4 cent per A ordinary share, which was an increase of 10.2%. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 73.4 cent per A ordinary share, payable on 12 May 2023 to shareholders registered on the record date of 14 April 2023. When combined with the interim dividend, the total dividend for the year amounts to 104.8 cent per share (2021: 95.2 cent per share}, which is an increase of 10.1% over last year's dividend. The Group's aim is to have double-digit dividend growth each year. Over 35 years as a listed company, the Group has grown its dividend at a compound rate of 16.1%.\n\nKerry's Annual General Meeting is scheduled to take place on 27 April 2023.",

This reflected volume growth of 8.4%, increased pricing of 7.4%, favourable transaction currency of 0.1% and favourable translation currency of 12.5%, with a contribution from acquisitions of 4.6%.\n\nGrowth in North America remained strong across both retail and foodservice channels through the year. This was led by an excellent performance in Meat and Meat Alternatives across food preservation, culinary taste, texture systems and clean-smoke technologies. Performance in the Beverage EUM continued to be strong, driven by new innovations incorporating Kerry's authentic natural taste, coffee extract and Tastesense\u00ae sugar reduction technologies. Good performance was achieved in Bakery through increased demand for functional solutions and texture systems, while Snacks continued to deliver strong growth with category leaders. Growth in foodservice remained strong due to seasonal and promotional menu offerings, as well as new launches enhancing backof-house efficiency for customers across both food and beverage applications.\n\nLATAM delivered excellent growth across the year led by Mexico and Brazil. Volume growth in Mexico was strong across Beverage and Snacks, supported by wins in authentic taste, while volumes in Brazil were driven by performance in Meals and Meat.\n\nWithin the global Pharma EUM, volumes in excipients were lower in the year due to supply chain constraints.\n\nDuring the year, the Group acquired the B2B powdered cheese business and related assets of the Kraft Heinz Company based in the US, enhancing Kerry's scale, manufacturing capability and customer base in the snacking category.\n\n- Volume growth of 6.2%\n- Snacks, Dairy and Meals delivered strongest growth\n- Growth led by foodservice while retail performed well\n\nRevenue in the region increased by 25.1% to \u20ac1.5 billion in the year. This reflected volume growth of 6.2%, increased pricing of 13.9%, favourable transaction currency of 0.2% and translation currency of 2.1%, with a contribution from acquisitions net of disposals of 2.7%.\n\nGrowth in the year was particularly strong given the economic backdrop in the region. The Snacks EUM delivered strong growth through savoury taste launches and Kerry's Tastesense\u00ae salt reduction technology portfolio, given increased customer focus on enhancing product nutritional profiles. Growth in Dairy was supported by new innovations in ice-cream and dairy alternative launches in the foodservice channel, while Meals continued to achieve good growth through taste systems and functional solutions. Performance in the foodservice channel was supported by continued innovation with quick service restaurants on new menu development and seasonal products.\n\nGrowth across the region was strongest in Central and Southern Europe, while the UK and Ireland had a very strong finish to the year. Performance in Eastern Europe was impacted by the ongoing war in the region. During the year, the Group divested its operations in Russia and Belarus, while further investing in its biotechnology capabilities with the acquisition of c-LEcta, which is a leading biotechnology innovation company based in Leipzig, Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kerry's material topics are defined through a comprehensive review involving detailed research and broad-based engagement of our internal and external stakeholders. In our most recent assessment in late 2021, we integrated the principle of dynamic materiality within the assessment process. Our assessment of outward impact uses the UN SDGs as a guiding framework and through expert stakeholder input, we defined key areas where Kerry can have the greatest environmental and socio-economic influence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INDUSTRY RECOGNITION IN ROME\n\nKerry's facility in Rome, Georgia, USA was the winner of Food Engineering magazine's 2022 Sustainable Project of the Year.

In 2022, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reported that 3.1 billion people did not have access to safe, affordable and nutritious food 1 . Malnutrition spans a range of nutritional inadequacies from chronic hunger, protein and micronutrient deficiencies to obesity.\n\n## Good Health and Wellbeing\n\nConsumers are increasingly mindful of the link between diet and health, and they want to make choices that reflect this. We can help by ensuring healthier food and beverage options are available. For instance, poor quality diets high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar (HFSS) can lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which account for one fifth of all adult deaths each year 2 . Many governments worldwide are introducing legislation to encourage healthier diets, including a ban on marketing of HFSS foods and the introduction of easy-to-read, front of pack nutrition labelling.\n\nEfforts such as these are influencing the food industry to create healthier products that still taste great. Helping our customers unlock new formulations to achieve this is a key way in which we can contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 'Good Health and Wellbeing.'",

There is also growing awareness around the environmental and social impact of food and so the way in which food is produced must also be a key consideration.\n\nWe enable our customers to move along the sustainable nutrition spectrum, co-creating products that deliver better nutrition for consumers with no compromise on taste. Our application expertise and delivery systems allow us to bring authentic tasting, convenient and familiar food to the consumer, increasing the availability of nutritious options with positive health benefits. Our environmental and social commitments also allow for these better-for-you products to be produced in a more sustainable way. For examples of how we support our customers, see page 61.\n\n## CONSUMER DEMAND FOR WELLBEING\n\nWith the acquisition of botanical extract company Natreon in 2022, we added Sensoril \u00ae ashwagandha to our portfolio. The ashwagandha plant was valued in ancient Ayurvedic medicine for its wellness benefits. Today, studies show it can reduce stress and improve sleep. Sensoril \u00ae is unique because it is made from ashwagandha leaves and roots, which science suggests offer optimal health benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 2022.

These studies reinforce Kerry's proprietary Sustainability in Motion research, which involved over 14,000 consumers across 18 countries.\n\nIn 2022, we examined the foodservice channel across Europe to understand how sustainability influences consumers' consumption choices out of home. We found that 55% of consumers claim to be eating more sustainably since the pandemic and that 71% believe sustainability is an important consideration in choosing what outlets to support. We shared these insights with customers and industry thought leaders at a specially convened foodservice sustainable nutrition conference in London, where we examined possible solutions to these consumer needs.\n\n## Health & Bio-Pharma\n\nKerry's Health & Bio-Pharma platform is focused on improving the health of people worldwide. Our proactive health portfolio of science-backed branded ingredients are used across food, beverages and supplement applications. These ingredients are clinically supported to promote consumer health across a range of need states, including immune, digestive, joint, cognitive and heart as well as infant and women's health.\n\n## Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute \u00ae :\n\nScience for Healthier Food\n\nThe Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute \u00ae (KHNI) was established to share Kerry's scientific expertise and thought leadership in the science of healthier food with the wider industry. Supported by an independent Scientific Advisory Council made up of recognised leaders in nutrition science and research, KHNI allows industry scientists, academics and other experts to explore challenges and opportunities shaping the future of food. This digital hub provides in-depth articles, webinars and\n\n## Measuring our Impact\n\nEstablishing clear definitions and metrics to track the impact of our products is essential. Our industry-leading nutrition profiling methodology assesses the nutritional contribution of our ingredients portfolio to a final consumer product. We have identified that more than 80% of our Taste & Nutrition portfolio delivers positive or balanced nutrition solutions.\n\nOver the next decade, we aim to increase this positive impact through innovation and partnerships, creating sustainable solutions that will reach more than two billion people. In 2022, we expanded our impact and increased our reach 2 with positive and balanced nutrition solutions to 1.2 billion people. This was driven by the availability of new nutrition solutions within our portfolio and our geographical expansion in developing regions. For more on our approach see our white paper on nutritional profiling at kerry.com/sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhite papers written for those working in the food industry, by experts within the food industry.\n\nTo date, KHNI has welcomed more than half a million visitors to engage with this industryleading content, leveraging our global team of more than 1,100 experts in nutrition, food science, sustainability, health, taste, sensory and life sciences.

In 2022, we built on this expertise with the launch of the Kerry Nutri Guide , which helps companies subject to Business-to-Consumer (B2C) profiling to create nutritionally-optimised products.\n\nThe Kerry Nutri Guide is a digital tool that helps customers navigate front-of-pack nutritional labels. It allows for an instant assessment of a final product across eleven recognised labelling systems as well as national legislation from Europe, UK, Brazil and Mexico. By making this information more accessible, the nutritional impacts are immediately visible and our customers are better able to create healthier food and beverage products that meet consumer needs.\n\n## CONNECTING TASTE AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nTaste is the biggest driver of food and beverage purchases. But these preferences change quickly - from traditional and nostalgic to novel and exotic.\n\nSocial listening is helping our market research teams tune into the future of flavour.\n\nOur insights tool Kerry Trendspotter \u00ae tracks social media posts to see which flavours influencers are experimenting\n\nwith. Then it uses artificial intelligence to predict which of those emerging tastes are most likely to have an impact with consumers.\n\nWe are also regularly tracking consumer opinions on sustainability and see that consumers increasingly want authentic taste that is created with ingredients that are produced in a sustainable way.\n\n- 1 Innova Market Insights: Top 10 Food Trends 2023.\n- 2 Our approach to calculating consumer reach was developed in partnership with independent third parties and combines the outputs from our industry-leading nutritional assessment with external market data and Kerry's business insight.

Therefore, in 2022, we enhanced our innovation process to further embed sustainability design within new innovations and development work across existing product lines. This process encourages our RD&A teams to consider impacts at all stages of a product's lifecycle and improve performance in key areas such as raw material selection, waste prevention and resource use.\n\nHere are three ways innovation is inspiring sustainability.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## Sodium reduction\n\nMany customers are facing regulatory and consumer pressures to reformulate bakery, meat and snack products to reduce salt intake. Our Kerry Tastesense\u00ae Salt solutions solve taste challenges when sodium is low/reduced. It is one of the tools from our 'toolbox' approach to harmonising and rebalancing healthier and tastier products.\n\n## Liquid probiotic delivery system\n\nBC30 TM , a probiotic with scientifically supported immune and digestive benefits, can be added to applications that do not typically support traditional probiotics, increasing the access to health benefits for more consumers.\n\n## No/low alcohol solutions\n\nNo and low-alcohol beverages are gaining popularity due to societal changes and the increasingly health-conscious consumer. Kerry Tastesense\u00ae Sensations supports beverage manufacturers by replicating alcohol perception and, when used with the Simply Nature TM flavour portfolio, contributes to the creation of unique beverages.\n\n## PARTNERING TO CREATE HEALTHIER PRODUCTS\n\nFor years, people have read ingredient lists to figure out which foods are healthy. For example, in Singapore, Australia, France and several other countries, the process is getting easier, due to new frontof-pack health labels and ratings.\n\nThe scores, which are often displayed as a sum-total 'grade' for the nutritional quality of a product, make it easy to tell, for instance, which cereals on a shelf rate as healthiest.\n\nMany countries are also introducing\n\nMany countries are also introducing legislative restrictions. For example, the UK is restricting the marketing of products that qualify as less healthy when assessed through a specified nutritional profile model.\n\nThese new ratings and regulations, plus the general shift toward betterfor-you products, are driving brands to make more nutritious foods and beverages.\n\nOne customer recently asked us to help them halve the amount of sodium in a salt and vinegar potato chip - without losing the mouthwatering taste. Our RD&A teams created several variations, then used our Kerry Nutri Guide tool to ensure the new recipes met the customer's final product nutrition target. The winning chip recipe, which met the brand's ambitious goal, reduced the sodium to record low levels while keeping all the original flavour intact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It serves as a guide for those who work with and for Kerry, outlining the standards and policies that must be upheld in important areas including human rights, business integrity and environmental compliance. The Code of Conduct is available in 26 languages and offers insight on how certain workplace situations should be handled, while providing direction on points of contact for those who may require additional support. For example, it describes our zero-tolerance approach and provides guidance to all employees regarding potential situations involving bribery and corruption.\n\nThe Business Integrity Committee provides oversight on all areas of ethical compliance across the Group and all colleagues are required to be familiar and comply with our Code of Conduct. We have communicated broadly on these requirements across the organisation since refreshing the content of our Code in 2021.\n\nWe are focused on ensuring that everyone at Kerry understands the requirements within the Code of Conduct and their universal application regardless of role, seniority or location. Our dedicated training and certification programme helps us to monitor this, and in 2022, over 88% of required colleagues achieved Code of Conduct certification (2021: >90%).\n\nWe encourage anyone with a concern about a breach of our Code of Conduct to raise this through the available channels. Our Speak Up Policy provides guidance for individuals on how to raise a concern, including through our dedicated Speak Up facility available to colleagues and external parties who wish to do so anonymously. For more on our approach to business ethics and reporting of potential issues, see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## Protecting Human Rights\n\nKerry is fully committed to upholding internationallyrecognised human rights. Our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy apply to all employees and sets expectations for our business and supply chain partners.\n\nIn 2022, Kerry's work on human rights continued to be led by the Social Sustainability Council, chaired by the Group's Chief Human Resources Officer. All our manufacturing facilities are required to complete a self-assessment which provides visibility of potential human rights impacts within our business. In addition, independent reviews by platforms such as EcoVadis provide an additional evaluation of our approach.\n\nAcross our supply chain, our Supplier Code of Conduct is explicit in setting out our expectations of suppliers, particularly regarding our most salient human rights issues. We continue to monitor supplier compliance, taking a risk-based approach to this evaluation. In 2022, we adopted a more targeted approach based on risk at manufacturing locations and 71% of our high-risk suppliers 1 were enrolled on Sedex (Supplier ethical data exchange) and more than half of these had undergone a Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA). We continue to engage the remaining high-risk suppliers, along with any qualifying new suppliers to our business.\n\nTo enhance our approach on human rights, we have engaged with an expert partner to help review our current processes and identify opportunities for further improvement. This project will continue into 2023 and considers current best practice and proposed legislative changes, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. This work will guide the further development of our human rights and social sustainability efforts.",

Around the world, many people still struggle to access employment and equal opportunities because of their race, gender, sexual orientation or other perceived differences. At Kerry, we treat each employee as an individual. This is reflected in several dedicated policies within our Code of Conduct, including our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy, which requires that employees treat fellow workers and applicants fairly and never engage in any form of unlawful discrimination.\n\nKerry has 118 nationalities represented in our overall workforce, and we believe our senior leadership and management levels should reflect this. In 2022, 84% of senior management at our significant locations were hired from within the local community (2021: 86%).\n\nWe continue to focus on our gender diversity targets, with female representation at senior management level at 36% in 2022, versus our target of gender parity by 2030 (2021: 36%). We aim to have 35% of senior leadership positions held by women by 2025, and at year end had reached 33% (2021: 29%). Our efforts to deliver on this ambition for inclusive leadership include the 2022 launch of a dedicated toolkit to equip our leaders with the skills required to lead conversations on the topic of diversity, inclusion and belonging with their teams and to better understand and eliminate unconscious bias. Available in 11 languages, the toolkit provides practical guidance, templates and tools in the areas of Psychological Safety, Inclusion, Belonging, Fair Treatment and Integrating Difference.\n\nImportantly, in 2022, employee perception of Kerry as an inclusive organisation increased by two percentage points, as measured by our Inclusion Index.

We have set a science-based target for emissions reduction by 2030, which commits us to a 55% absolute reduction in our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions and a 30% reduction in intensity of other emissions within our value chain (Scope 3).\n\nIn 2022, we made strong progress towards this target, driven by our shift to renewable energy. 100% of our purchased electricity across the Group now comes from renewable sources or is backed by renewable energy certificates and the associated reduction in our Scope 2 emissions has made a significant contribution to our overall carbon performance. By year end, we achieved a 48% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions over our 2017 baseline (2021: 33%).\n\nWe also continue to focus on Scope 1 emissions through improving energy efficiency and switching to cleaner fuels, however, many of these initiatives will take longer to implement and the scale and speed of reduction in any given year may vary.\n\n## DELIVERING A CLEANER SMOKE TASTE\n\nSome of the most authentic and distinct tastes come from cooking food over fire. The smoke from hickory wood - common to North American barbecue - imparts a flavour quite different from the searing hot coals used in South African braai.\n\nUnfortunately, cooking with fire and consuming foods that have been traditionally smoked comes with health concerns and environmental risks. Kerry Red Arrow \u00ae condensed natural smoke helps brands bring more consistent, efficient, and sustainable products to the market.\n\nWe make our Kerry Red Arrow \u00ae smoke range by capturing and condensing real smoke from various types of wood, utilising byproduct from the timber industry. We then filter and decant the smoke making it better for the consumer and the environment. In defining smoke flavours, the European Commission noted that smoke flavours are a healthier alternative to conventional smoking. In addition, compared to conventional smoking, the use of smoke flavours has proven to reduce CO2 emissions by 83%, water consumption by 92%, wastewater by 83% and cleaning detergents consumption by 68% 1 .\n\n## CDP\n\nIn 2022, Kerry once again achieved a CDP score of A-, placing us at leadership level for our action and reporting on climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SBTi\n\nKerry's Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our Scope 1 and 2 targets are aligned with a 1.5\u2070C pathway and we continue to engage with SBTi on changes to Scope 3, considering their recent guidance on emissions relating to Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG), which is applicable for our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for the Food, Drink and Milk Industries (europa.eu)",

Within this, dairy is the single largest contributor and a focus area for engagement with our supply base.\n\nOur Evolve Dairy Sustainability Programme, which launched in 2022, incentivises farmers to implement science-based measures that lower carbon emissions, protect nature and improve the resilience of their operations. By supporting close to 3,000 farmers in south-west Ireland, this programme also offers a template for engagement with other dairy ingredient suppliers to our business. Uptake of the programme has been strong in its first year, particularly in the area of lower emissions fertiliser, which will contribute to a lower footprint across this supply base. For more on Evolve see page 73.\n\nCategory-wide, our total Scope 3 intensity has reduced by 4% in 2022 compared to our 2017 baseline (2021: 0%). Reductions in 2022 have been driven, in part, by lower emissions from dairy and changes in our portfolio mix. For more details on Scope 3 see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Tackling Plastic Waste\n\nWe fully support a more circular approach to plastics and have committed to making all our plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. We work\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n2017 Baseline\n\nto reduce the volume of virgin plastic and increase recycled content, while evaluating alternative packaging formats that can maintain product integrity. Examples include incorporating recycled plastic content in DaVinci Gourmet bottles used within the foodservice channel and the use of 100% recyclable packaging for our Dairygold brand. In 2022, 74% of the plastic packaging used across our business was reusable, recyclable or compostable (2021: 57%).\n\n## Halving Food Loss and Waste\n\nGiven the environmental impacts of food production, tackling food loss and waste represents a way to address climate change as well as a significant business opportunity.\n\nOur portfolio of clean label and conventional food protection and preservation technologies significantly impact food waste in the value chain, particularly downstream. This is a growth platform for our business with a key focus on the bakery and meat end use markets. These markets represent the most significant categories where food is lost or wasted by volume and value, respectively. The opportunity for impact is clear when we consider that in 2022, Kerry products were used to extend the shelf life of over 52 billion servings of meat.\n\nTo help our customers understand the impact of food loss and waste on their business and the environment, we developed and launched the Kerry Food Waste Estimator in 2022.",

Given the diverse nature of our portfolio, the achievement of this goal involves working across sites to understand the key drivers of food waste locally and implementing the most appropriate actions to deliver on our target. For example, some waste streams can be recovered as an input to other processes, others can be turned into biofertilisers or animal feed, and some finished products can be distributed to local charities and food banks. In 2022, we continued to make progress against this goal with a 32% reduction compared to our 2017 baseline (2021: 17%).\n\n## Adopting a More Circular Approach\n\nTo lower our environmental impact, we are targeting a more circular approach to resource use within our business. This keeps materials in productive use for longer and captures additional value from what were previously considered waste streams.\n\nWithin our operations, we seek to ensure our own waste streams are put to productive uses, with 93% going towards recycling or recovery and 95% of all waste volumes diverted from landfill (2021: 94%).\n\n## 2022 Waste Recovery\n\n## 2022 Waste by Destination\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n95%\n\nDiverted Waste\n\nLandfill\n\nDiverted Waste Diverted Waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLandfill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n93%\n\nRecycling/Recovery\n\nLandfill\n\nRecycling/Recovery\n\nLandfill\n\nIncineration (energy recovery)\n\nLandfill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Incineration (energy recovery)\n\nLandfill volumes include waste sent for incineration without energy recovery\n\n## Upcycling Ingredients\n\nGiven our innovation and process capabilities, Kerry is ideally positioned to support customers in their use of 'upcycled' ingredients. For example, cheese waste occurs across the industry due to manufacturing constraints, spoilage and supply chain limitations. Our cheese powders facility in Denmark is unique because it upcycles this material into high quality and shelf stable cheese powders that deliver an authentic cheese taste. In doing so, we maximise the potential of the food source and the resources used to produce it, whilst simultaneously minimising food waste. A detailed carbon footprint study undertaken in 2022 shows these products are on average, 45% lower in carbon emissions than conventional alternatives.",

        "page_content": "## Protecting Water Resources\n\nWater is vital for our business. It is a shared resource, and we have a responsibility to use it carefully, minimising our withdrawals, protecting water sources and ensuring adequate access for other water users.\n\nAcross our operations we are targeting a 15% reduction in water intensity by 2025. We initiated several projects in 2022 that will contribute to this goal. For example, we are investing approximately two million euro to improve water efficiency at our site in Plant City, Florida, USA. This will significantly reduce the water intake at this facility upon completion in 2023. In Anneyron, France, we updated our cooling systems, leading to a reduction of over 25% in water use. The Group's water efficiency has already improved by 5% compared to our 2017 base (2021: 3%) with an expected acceleration in future years on the completion of several planned projects.\n\nWe also understand that water discharges from our sites can have an impact on local water quality and make every effort to ensure we protect local water sources. We track and monitor compliance with relevant water standards on an ongoing basis. For more details on our water use, see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n## Water Risk\n\nUsing the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Tool, we identified nine priority manufacturing facilities that may be more vulnerable to water risk. Average water intensity across these sites exceeds that for the Group and was 12% lower in 2022 versus our 2017 base year (2021: 9%). We maintain a focus on water at these locations and in 2022 we undertook a programme of metering, monitoring and targeting to help drive ongoing improvements. The outcomes of this programme will inform water reduction activities across these sites. m 3 /tonne 2017 Baseline\n\n## 2022 Water Withdrawal by Source (Megalitres)\n\n## Water Intensity at Higher Risk Sites\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSurface Water\n\nGround Water\n\n- Municipal Water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\nOur target for water is a relative measure of metres cubed (m3) divided by tonnes of finished product produced.\n\nOur data reflects water use across our manufacturing facilities and is a like for like performance versus our base year.\n\n## Protecting Biodiversity\n\nAmid the alarming rate of species and habitat loss, the preservation of biodiversity is an increasingly material topic for our business. Kerry has potential to impact biodiversity directly through our operations and indirectly through the raw materials we source. Our most significant impacts are linked to our supply chain and we are working towards the preservation of tropical forests and the rich biodiversity they contain.\n\nWe are committed to eliminating deforestation across targeted supply chains by 2025, focusing on those that are the leading drivers of forest loss, including cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil and paper packaging. We are members of several multi-stakeholder initiatives focused on this area including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), SAI Platform (including their deforestation workstream within the Sustainable Dairy Partnership) and others. For more on our evolving approach to preserving biodiversity, see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Responsible Sourcing\n\n4 Given our from-food-for-food heritage, the greatest impacts associated with our products often lie with agricultural production. While it can present social and environmental challenges, agriculture can help reduce poverty, raise incomes and improve food security for 80% of the world's poor 1 .\n\n2.5 3.0 3.5 As part of our vision to create a world of sustainable nutrition, we are engaging our suppliers to drive more sustainable practices, ensuring that 100% of priority raw materials are responsibly sourced by 2030. In 2022, we set out and communicated our requirements for suppliers across categories linked to deforestation and we continue to work directly with supply partners and other third parties on programmes deployed at farm level.",

For more detail on our responsible sourcing categories see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Dairy\n\nWe maintained 100% certification of our Irish milk volumes under the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme. This programme, operated independently through Bord Bia (the Irish Food Board), means all farmers are audited every 18 months and this allows for carbon footprinting of all individual farms. We work directly with farmers to support them on measures that improve the sustainability of their enterprise and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nFor the dairy ingredients we purchase, our goal is for 80% of volumes to be at Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) level 3 or higher by 2025. Currently, 15% of our volumes come from suppliers who are members of the SDP and we continue to engage our suppliers on this new platform and our requirements.\n\n## Evolve Dairy Sustainability Programme\n\nWe still work with many of the Irish dairy farming families that helped us launch our business 50 years ago. While their natural, grass-based approach to farming has not changed, on-farm practices continue to evolve and there is growing pressure for more sustainable agriculture.\n\nThis past year, with a shared goal of helping the planet and improving the livelihoods of our farmers, we launched the Evolve Dairy Sustainability Programme.\n\nFarm by farm, we share techniques to help reduce carbon and ammonia production and improve water quality. These include better grazing and water management practices, innovations in animal health and welfare and insights into the benefits of biodiversity.\n\nOne of the more visible benefits is the addition of trees to farmland around Ireland. As part of the programme, we are committed to plant 200,000 new trees by 2025. For more details see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Palm Oil\n\nIn 2022, we updated our Palm Oil Policy and requirements for suppliers. Alongside verification, certification remains an important element of our sourcing approach for palm oil and 39% of our volume is RSPO certified (20% Mass Balance; 19% Segregated or Identity Preserved). We continue to map our supply chain and seek traceability to both mill and plantation with our leading suppliers. For more, see our palm progress report on kerry.com.\n\n## Coffee\n\nOur approach to this category was outlined as we developed and communicated our Coffee Policy in 2022, supported by a requirements guide, which clearly outlines our expectations of suppliers. Through direct engagement we have made progress in mapping our supply to country of origin for more than 90% of our volumes. Given the fragmentation in this supply chain, certification will play a key role in achieving our category target.\n\n## Non-Financial Reporting Statement\n\nWe comply with regulations on non-financial reporting and provide information on required topics across this report and within our 2022 Sustainability Report. Relevant information on each topic can be found below.

This Committee takes a lead role in Board guidance and oversight of the Group's actions on climate change, as part of its role in governing Kerry's broader sustainability strategy. Membership of this Committee includes Board members with deep experience across food and beverage, as well as other sectors heavily impacted by climate change, including energy and agriculture. Further details of Board members experience can be found on pages 108-110.\n\n## Board Oversight of Climate Change Impact\n\nThe Board and/or its relevant Committees received five dedicated updates from senior executives including the Group Head of Sustainability, the Chief Corporate Affairs and Brand Officer and the Sustainability Reporting team on matters including the Group's performance on its climate goals and strategy, climate-related risks and opportunities and our climate-related disclosures. In addition, details relating to climate change are provided by other leaders as part of their functional updates, ensuring that it is increasingly integrated into the broader strategic decision-making process.\n\nIn 2022, the potential climate impacts were considered by the Board across a range of areas including decisions on major capital expenditure and business acquisitions. The Board also considered climate-related metrics as part of the Group's financial and business planning cycle, with climate-related metrics incorporated within the budget review process, alongside indicators on growth,\n\nfinancial performance and returns.\n\nThe Audit Committee engaged with Executive Management on climate-related risks and assessed how these have been reviewed and accounted for as part of the overall risk management process in 2022. The Audit Committee also reviewed and approved the Group's climate-related disclosures for this period.\n\nIn addition, following their introduction in 2021, the Remuneration Committee continued to incorporate climate-related metrics and targets into the reward structure for Executive Directors and senior leaders.\n\nThe Board is supported by the Global Sustainability Council, which is led by the CEO and comprises executive and functional leadership from across the Group. This Council is the key forum at which climate-related risks and opportunities impacting the organisation are addressed with senior management, and the Council has ultimate responsibility for the assessment and management of these issues as part of its broader sustainability remit.\n\nGiven the interdependent nature of climate-related risks and opportunities, additional governance councils are in place at functional and regional levels across the organisation to support the work of the Global Sustainability Council. These include dedicated fora related to our operations, product portfolio and responsible sourcing. Led by a relevant senior executive, each Council meets at least quarterly and provides a platform for addressing various elements of the risks and opportunities facing our business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These projects are implemented by cross-functional teams, working collaboratively to ensure we maximise the sustainability impact with no disruption to our business. Each functional Council provides an update on progress for their area and escalates issues as required to the Global Sustainability Council throughout the year.\n\n## Linking Climate and Remuneration\n\nKerry's remuneration philosophy ensures that executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose, culture and values, supports strategy and promotes the longterm success of the company. The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Directors and senior leaders reflects this through the three key areas of growth, return and sustainability.\n\nThe incentive plan considers core sustainability metrics linked to our Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy. The metrics used include food waste and carbon reduction, specifically the progress towards our sciencebased targets on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. More details on this can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 151-152.\n\nFor further details on Group Governance, see our Corporate Governance Report on pages 117-130.\n\n## Strategy\n\nKerry's Vision is to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition. Our business strategy is aligned to fulfilling this ambition and Kerry's Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy helps us to accelerate our actions and integrate sustainability within our business. The two critical elements of this programme are:\n\n- the focus on commitments that will support the transformation of our business into a more sustainable enterprise;\n- our innovation capability enabling customers to create more sustainable products, supported by our technology portfolio.\n\nWe keep our climate commitments under ongoing review, aligning with a science-based approach and responding to evolving best practice. The importance of our role as an enabler of sustainable nutrition for our customers is clearly reflected in our medium-term plan, which was presented at the end of 2021 with a focus on growth platforms that support a transition to healthier, lower impact diets. These include:\n\n- Authentic Taste, which recognises that taste is a critical driver of purchase behaviour and a fundamental requirement for any sustainable food and beverage innovation\n\n- Plant-based offerings, which provide lower carbon food and beverage alternatives. Kerry has a portfolio that supports our customers in their innovation journey across all end use markets\n- Food Waste solutions, such as food protection and preservation, which help our customers and consumers lessen their impact in this critical area, and\n- Health & Bio-Pharma, which supports our customers in delivering better nutrition and wellbeing for consumers at all life stages.\n\nWe recognise the role that climate change can play in influencing the delivery of our business strategy. Physical impacts will arise as global average temperatures increase and socio-economic changes are inevitable as part of the transition to a low carbon economy. As we prepare for these changes, we continue to assess the potential risks and opportunities for our business, ensuring that we maintain a focus on reducing our emissions while adapting to these changing external conditions.\n\nWe are also embedding our Beyond the Horizon commitments into our financing strategy. In 2021, Kerry issued a \u20ac750 million, ten-year Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB) which could result in an interest coupon step-up if certain sustainability performance indicators, including our Scope 1 and 2 climate targets, are not met.\n\n## Identifying Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities\n\nTo establish the climate-related impacts that are most material for the organisation, we convened a dedicated working group to evolve our existing climate risk assessment and conducted a detailed qualitative and quantitative assessment of potential climate-related risks and opportunities. Over the last two years, this work has been guided by an Executive-led steering committee and through a process of stakeholder engagement, regulatory guidance, risk management and expert judgement, we have defined an extensive list of potential climate impacts for our business. This longlist was subsequently refined based on an appraisal of risk severity and likelihood, a method aligned with our overall risk management framework, and this has provided us with a focused set of risks and opportunities for more detailed analysis.\n\n## Assessing Climate-Related Risk\n\nModelling the potential impacts of climate-related risk to our business is complex. As the climate crisis unfolds, climate-related impacts and policy responses will manifest in different ways and over different timehorizons. We typically consider business risk over a period of up to five years. In doing so, we consider how climate-related impacts may contribute to other key risk areas in that timeframe, however, the physical impacts of climate risk require a longer-term view. As a result, our approach to assessing climate as a discrete risk uses an extended time horizon. To account for the more gradual impacts of certain physical climate-related events, we have chosen to examine the potential impact of climate change on our business using 2030 (medium-term) and 2050 (long-term) as our reference timeframes. For more on how we integrate climate-related risks into our broader risk management framework, see page 82-83.",

Our assessment will continue to evolve as scientific understanding improves and as we build our internal knowledge and expertise. In line with TCFD guidance we consider two types of physical risk:\n\nAcute : Acute physical risks refer to those risks that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme weather events.\n\nChronic : Chronic physical risks refer to longer-term shifts in climate patterns that may lead to impacts such as sea level rise or chronic heat waves.\n\nAs part of our assessment, we first identified a range of physical climate risks that could potentially impact on our business. These hazards include forest fire, flooding, drought, extreme wind, and sea level rise. We screened our global manufacturing footprint for exposure to these specific climate hazards and through this exercise, prioritised a smaller number of locations for more detailed review. This deep dive focused on a longer time horizon and identified five locations across Europe, North America and our APMEA region with a higher exposure, driven primarily by an increased risk of flooding.\n\nOur distribution network, which brings in raw materials to our sites and delivers product to our customers, is also subject to potential risk from these climate hazards, primarily extreme weather events impacting the transport of goods by sea, road and rail. The assessment of our supply chain shows good resilience, albeit there is some concentration of risk in key locations. The assessment was completed at a national scale and while this provides a high-level estimate of potential risk, we continue to refine the approach and enhance this quantification.\n\nWe also examined how future physical climate changes may impact on raw material availability, selecting a\n\nbasket of seven important agricultural inputs in use across our business, including dairy, wheat and maize. Using the land suitability index 1 , we assessed changes in land considered commercially viable for producing crops under rainfed conditions for different temperature scenarios. The assessment indicated the potential for some impact to agricultural output, with impacts varying by commodity and geography, however, overall land suitability for the selected raw materials does not indicate a significant risk for the commodities in scope over the period examined. When we look at additional variables, including the projected demand for these raw materials and climate related price impacts, we see upward price pressure on these commodities over the medium to longer-term.\n\n## Transition Risk\n\nTransitioning to a lower carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. Depending on the nature, speed and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to organisations. The risk of current and emerging regulation is a key climate consideration for the Group. This includes forthcoming disclosure requirements linked to nonfinancial reporting. Given its global footprint, Kerry will be subject to different requirements in a number of jurisdictions and the scope, scale and speed of implementation will pose challenges for all organisations. Among the most prominent policy risks for our business is the expansion of carbon pricing by Governments as they seek to curtail emissions and meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Three of our manufacturing facilities are currently subject to the EU and UK emissions trading schemes and the broadening of their scope, or the introduction of similar pricing mechanisms in other jurisdictions, could result in a significant cost to our business. In our risk assessment, we have modelled carbon price increases to 2030 and considered how direct costs may be impacted if all manufacturing sites were subject to a carbon price by this date.\n\n- 1 International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) GlobalAgro-Ecological Zoning version 4 (GAEZ v4) databases for the period range 1990 -2050",

        "page_content": "Our assessment of technology risk focuses on the transition to clean energy and decarbonisation of our operations. As industry shifts towards the use of cleaner technology, it is important that we invest to avoid additional costs or reputational impacts that could affect the Group's competitiveness. As part of our roadmap towards Net Zero, we have identified key levers that will provide us with a pathway to our 2030 targets and longer-term Net Zero ambition. In our risk assessment, we examined the potential costs associated with a targeted energy mix and the expected level of investment required to achieve this.\n\nFinally, for market-based risk , we looked at how consumer sentiment may drive a shift towards lower carbon alternatives across food and beverage. From our own proprietary research, Sustainability in Motion , we understand that consumers are seeking out healthier products that have a lower, environmental impact. Using external data sources 1 and demographic insights, we have looked at how this consumer sentiment may shift over time and the potential implications for our product portfolio.\n\nWe realise that climate change also represents a significant reputational risk for organisations. Kerry works with the world's leading food and beverage brands, many of whom have made their own commitments on climate change. They increasingly seek out partners that are aligned with their own objectives and who can support them in achieving their targets. This presents an opportunity for Kerry as we deliver on our Beyond the Horizon commitments. Conversely, failure to take adequate action on climate change could mean a loss of reputation and damage to commercial and other important stakeholder relationships. Given the difficulty in quantifying reputational risk, we have not modelled a quantitative assessment of impact.\n\n## Climate-Related Opportunities\n\nWhile climate change poses potentially significant risks for our industry it also presents potential opportunities for Kerry Group, particularly as customers seek to transition to a lower-carbon economy. The climaterelated opportunities outlined in the table below represent key areas where we see potential benefits for our business, while supporting our customers in their transition efforts.\n\n| Opportunity          |   No. | Description                                         | Time horizon   | Potential impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resource  Efficiency |     1 | Impact of energy  efficiency on  operational costs. | Short - Medium | A key lever in the achievement of our 2030 targets   is an ongoing focus on energy efficiency.

As a result, we have examined our business under a range of future scenarios, modelling different climate pathways to test the nature and magnitude of potential risks and opportunities.\n\n- 1 GreenPrint Business of Sustainability Index\n- 2 Aligns with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6\n- 3 Aligns with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe assess the most material physical and transition risks identified for Kerry Group under two climate pathways. The first pathway looks at changes which may occur if global average temperature increases are kept below two degrees Celsius by 2100 2 . The second assumes that emissions continue to increase so that global average temperature increases exceed four degrees Celsius by the end of the century 3 .",

For physical risks, we have employed a global climate risk analysis tool to help assess the potential impact of site damage and business interruption across our operations and transport routes. For transition risks, we use a global economic model, which incorporates an assessment of the carbon emissions associated with economic activities and the impact of constraining these.\n\n## Summary of Modelling Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact of Climate-Related Issues on Financial Performance\n\nWhile there have been some climate-related impacts on supply chains and operations in 2022, these did not have a significant impact on revenue or costs in the year. As noted above, three of our manufacturing sites are subject to EU and UK emissions trading schemes, which have experienced an increasing cost of carbon. We continue to focus on reducing emissions at these locations as part of our broader decarbonisation strategy. Extreme weather events in 2022 have had an impact on some raw material prices, however, the direct impact of this is difficult to separate from other cost drivers, which include the current geopolitical landscape and continuing supply chain disruptions.\n\nWe see the potential for growth within lower carbon alternative products as these continue to offer opportunities. Customers are increasingly seeking to understand the climate impact of their products and how this can be lowered in response to both consumer demand and their public commitments relating to emissions reduction. Energy price increases have also made capital projects relating to efficiency and the use of cleaner fuels more financially attractive, which will support our ongoing plans for emissions reduction across the Group.\n\n## Potential Future Impact of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThrough the use of scenario analysis, we have modelled potential future financial impacts for our business. While these are helpful in exploring areas of risk, there are limitations to the methodology and the number of variables with the potential to impact on future outcomes creates uncertainty. To overcome this and the gaps in available data, we have made certain assumptions about the future of our business and the context in which it will operate. Where we have done so, we have sought to base these assumptions on credible third-party data and expert judgement.\n\nWhile climate modelling is available to support the assessment of potential physical risks, the pathway to achieving a lower-carbon economy is highly variable, as governments, consumers and industry pursue a variety of approaches over differing timeframes. As a result, the modelling of transition pathways is particularly challenging, given the lack of certainty on the level and timing of any interventions. These uncertainties increase over time, making longer term modelling especially difficult and while we have examined key transition risks to our business beyond 2030, these are not included here, given the theoretical nature of these assessments. The following table outlines the potential financial impact associated with our key climate-related risks and opportunities. The ranges used to indicate the level of impact are cumulative and have been determined with reference to the approach used in assessing the significance of financial impact on our income statement and assets.",

We modelled a  carbon price of \u20ac130 per tonne taking effect across all our operations by 2030 under the  <2\u2070C scenario (assuming no such intervention in a >4\u2070C world). The impact of this cost is modest compared to the potential for much  greater cost increases in the event that a  higher carbon price is subsequently required  to achieve Net Zero by 2050.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Technology            | Adoption of  new technology  to support our  transition to a low  carbon business. | Cost           |                              | Medium Medium                | Increased regulatory and stakeholder  pressure creates widespread adoption of  clean energy technology.

This trend is assumed to grow over  time and become more significant under a <2\u2070C scenario. For the quantification of this opportunity, we have modelled a limited  number of proven lower-carbon solutions  aligned with our growth platforms. |\n\nIt should be noted that this is not a forecast. Scenario analysis is subject to limitations and based on several assumptions.\n\nThe information above should be viewed accordingly.\n\n## The Impact of Climate Change on Our Financial Statements\n\nWe considered the potential impacts of climate change risks when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and have determined that there is no material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates and as a result there is no impact on the valuations of the Group's assets and liabilities from these risks as at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, the impact of some of the climate related scenarios have been considered. The Group performed a number of sensitivity scenarios to incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities including impacts on revenue and profitability, future capital expenditure and investments as well as volatility associated with other risks identified.\n\nThe useful lives of assets are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology or the location of the asset and its climate-related risk.\n\n## Resilience of Kerry Group's Strategy\n\nWhen we review our strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario, we see a strong level of resilience.\n\nOur physical risk assessment has provided valuable insight into the longer-term risks across our operations and supply chain and while it identifies areas for further focus, it also highlights how our diverse geographic spread of manufacturing facilities and strategy of colocation in proximity to our customers, helps to limit Kerry's operational exposure to climate risk in any one",

To ensure continued resilience, we have looked at ways of improving the integration of specific climate-related risks within business continuity planning for higher risk sites and are examining public policy and action in areas where adaptation requires a broader based response.\n\nIn addition, we have accelerated our response to climate change with a 48% reduction in operational emissions since our 2017 base year and while water risk is deemed low impact, we continue to drive efficiencies across our operations. We also place a specific focus on sites in areas of water stress and look at additional ways to reduce water withdrawals at these locations. For more see page 72 of our Sustainability Review.\n\nFor our raw materials, our global sourcing strategy and responsible sourcing commitments will be important to help manage potential future risks to availability of key commodities as regional climatic impacts take effect. While overall land suitability for production is expected to be maintained, we do acknowledge the potential for extreme events that could impact on availability. As part of our responsible sourcing programme, we will continue to work with our suppliers, helping to ensure that carbon reduction plans are in place alongside programmes that can help improve the overall resilience of farmers and their communities.\n\nFurther down the value chain, the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our diverse customer base and range of channels helps to reduce the risk associated with any specific category or market segment and provides an opportunity for innovation across multiple end use markets. Our Research, Development and Application strategy is focused on growth platforms that are aligned with a low carbon transition and we work as a trusted partner with our customers, co-creating products to meet changing consumer preferences. Our investment in innovation reflects the importance of climate action across our customers' brands and our technical capability and extensive portfolio of solutions strengthens our position as a partner of choice.\n\nCarbon pricing and technology shifts will continue to be important considerations for the Group in delivering on our strategy. Our climate transition plan is critical to managing this potential area of risk and delivering on the decarbonisation of our operations in line with Kerry's 2030 targets, longer-term Net Zero ambition and stated climate policy across jurisdictions where we operate. Focused on key areas of impact, this transition plan will continue to evolve for both our operations and supply chain as we make progress on target initiatives and gain additional insight on low-carbon approaches, particularly across our value chain.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe identification, assessment and management of climate-related risks follow the Group's existing risk management framework, however, the time horizons have been extended to allow for the longerterm impacts of climate change. This work has been\n\nsupported by an Executive-led steering committee, which has helped to define a focused set of risks for detailed analysis, as outlined on page 77.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for providing structured and systematic oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Group's risk assessment process is a coordinated bottom-up and top-down group-wide approach that facilitates the identification and evaluation of risks, as well as assessing how the risks are monitored, managed and mitigated. This process is facilitated by our Internal Audit function and overseen by the Risk Oversight Committee. For more on our principal risks and the risk assessment process see our Risk Management Report on pages 94-105.\n\nWithin our risk management framework, we adopt an integrated approach to assessing and managing climate-related risks across our business and wider value chain, which involves a dual approach as follows:\n\n- i) We include 'Climate Change and Environmental' risk as a standalone principal risk for our business, considering the longer-term systemic nature of the risk and the requirements for shorter-term action to mitigate and plan for this.\n- ii) We also consider how discrete climate-related impacts can affect other risk areas and integrate climate considerations within additional principal risks, for example, the potential impacts of extreme weather on raw material availability.\n\nAs part of the Group's enterprise risk management framework, we have defined parameters under which we quantify potential impact. The significance of this risk is determined using a standard risk scoring methodology to ensure consistency in reporting and evaluation of risks.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite is agreed annually with the Board and as a result we seek to minimise climaterelated risks while ensuring the ongoing success of our business. The management of these climate-related risks is undertaken within the function where the risk may occur, for example, raw material risks are managed by procurement. Any actions taken must be sufficient to bring climate risks within the agreed appetite for the Group and the Chief Operating Officer has executive responsibility for these mitigations on climate change. He is supported in this work by the Council structure outlined on page 75.\n\nIn 2022, climate considerations, particularly our key climate risks, were also a critical area of focus during dedicated risk reviews with the business. This allowed us to explore how climate-related issues can impact on strategies within regions and key functional teams and further assess the controls which are in place. Prioritisation of any additional action is based on materiality and defined by potential severity and likelihood of the impact.",

The divergence in approaches, scope and timelines across different frameworks pose a risk for businesses and we have engagement with our Board, executive management and functional teams to ensure they understand these forthcoming requirements and that the business can respond appropriately.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nOur Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy sets out several important target areas related to climate action. Key among these, is our science-based target for emissions reduction across all scopes by 2030 and our ambition to achieve Net Zero before 2050. As part of our transition plan, we have made strong progress against this goal with a 48% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2022 and the achievement of our 100% renewable electricity objective three years ahead of our initial target timeframe.\n\nWe continue to examine how best to enhance disclosures relating to our decarbonisation roadmap and progress towards our Net Zero ambition. We report on climate metrics to multiple platforms, including CDP and in 2022 maintained our leadership score. We have completed further work in 2022 to help identify and quantify our Scope 3 emissions and we have ongoing engagement with our value chain and expert partners on improving both the accuracy and transparency of our data.\n\nIn line with TCFD Guidance, we disclose the following climate-related metrics which are relevant for our business, outlining how these relate to specific areas of climate-related risk and opportunity which have been identified. For more information on our metrics and targets, including Scope 3 breakdown, boundaries and calculation approach see our 2022 Sustainability Report on kerry.com.",

Under this action plan the EU has defined a taxonomy of sustainable activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the 'Taxonomy Regulation') and the supplementary Delegated Regulation C(2021) 4987 was introduced to increase the level of transparency on environmental information through a common classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n\nAt present, the EU Taxonomy does not cover all industries and its sustainable classification criteria is not yet applicable to Kerry's ongoing core business activities.\n\nIn the following section, the Group has outlined the extent to which some limited activities are eligible and aligned under the first two environmental objectives; climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (Climate Delegated Act) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Complementary Climate Delegated Act). For the 2022 financial year, only these two environmental objectives are in scope for reporting.\n\nAn expansion in the scope of the EU Taxonomy is expected in 2023, as the remaining four environmental objectives come into scope (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). We are preparing for expanded disclosures as the regulation takes effect.",

Our core business involves the manufacture of food and beverage products, which is not currently in scope of the EU Taxonomy.\n\nIn 2022, we assessed our activities for eligibility to see whether the Group's turnover, Operating Expenditure (OpEx) or Capital Expenditure (CapEx) correspond to an economic activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act. Our assessment determined that our Taxonomy-eligible activities were all classified under climate change mitigation, reflecting activities being taken in line with our Beyond the Horizon strategy. As we allocated our business activities to only one environmental objective, we avoided double counting in the two environmental objectives that are in scope.\n\nOnce we determined the eligible activities, we assessed each activity for alignment. For each activity, we considered the technical screening criteria as described in the Climate Delegated Act. We determined the activities that made a substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective and that did no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives along with compliance with minimum safeguards. The assessment of compliance against minimum safeguards leverages policies such as our Group Code of Conduct and established processes across the Group.\n\nUsing the EU Taxonomy Compass, we assessed all our Taxonomy-eligible projects against specific Taxonomyalignment criteria for each activity. For example, for the activity installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment, under substantial contribution criteria for climate mitigation, we assessed against the energy efficiency criteria. For do no significant harm\n\n## Applicable for 2022\n\n|   1 | Climate change mitigation   |\n|-----|-----------------------------|\n|   2 | Climate change adaptation   |\n\nfor climate adaptation, we assessed against the criteria outlined in Appendix A to the Annex 1 including the physical climate risk assessment of our sites. For do no significant harm for pollution prevention, we assessed against the criteria in Appendix C to the Annex 1 , as these were the requirements for this activity.\n\nThe evaluation of eligibility and alignment was conducted by a cross functional working group, including the Sustainability Reporting Team, Engineering and Research, Development & Application (RD&A) teams. The evaluation process allocated projects to distinct categories to avoid double counting in the numerator across economic activities in the turnover, OpEx and CapEx Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nThe KPIs calculated and disclosed in the tables below indicate the proportion of turnover, OpEx and CapEx in the following categories:\n\n- Taxonomy-aligned: Activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act and meets all of the Technical Screening Criteria (substantial contribution and do no significant harm) as well as complying with minimum safeguards\n- Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned: Activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act and does not meet the Technical Screening Criteria or does not comply with minimum safeguards\n- Taxonomy-non-eligible: An activity that is not described in the Climate Delegated Act\n\nWe also assessed activities against the Complementary Climate Delegated Act and have not completed templates 1 to 5 as none of the activities listed in this Act are applicable to Kerry.",

For further details on Kerry's revenue accounting policy, see Note 1 of the Financial Statements. In determining the KPIs for turnover, the share that is Taxonomy-aligned (numerator) and Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned (numerator) is each divided by the denominator.\n\nThe manufacture of food and beverage products was deemed non-eligible as these activities are currently not in scope under the EU Taxonomy. We conducted a deeper review of our turnover with cross functional support and input from the Group's Chief Science and Technology Officer against the economic activities included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. This assessment showed no eligible turnover (numerator) and therefore we established the Taxonomy-eligible turnover to be 0% in 2022 (0% in 2021).\n\nAs no activities were deemed Taxonomy-eligible, there is no requirement to assess alignment.\n\n## Proportion of turnover from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nSubstantial contribution criteria\n\n| Economic Activities (1)                                                                                                 | Codes (2)                       | Absolute  turno ver (3)         | Pr oportion of turno ver (4)    | Climate change  mitigation (5)   | Climate change  adaptation (6)   | W ater and marine  r esour ces (7)   | Cir cular economy (8)           | Pollution (9)                   | Biodiversity and  ecosystems (10)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                         |                                 | \u20ac'm                             | %                               | %                                | %                                | %                                    | %                               | %                               | %                                   |\n| A.

Despite ongoing challenges, such as increased geopolitical uncertainty triggered by the invasion of Ukraine and a turbulent macroeconomic environment, our performance continues to highlight the resilience of our people, our business model and our proven track record of delivery through uncertainty.\n\nThe diversified nature of our operations and geographical footprint, together with our broad portfolio of products, customers and suppliers are important factors in mitigating the risk of a material threat to the Group's sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. However, as with any business, risks and uncertainties are inherent in our business activities and may have a significant financial, operational or reputational impact.\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for the management of risk and for aligning with management on the Group's risk appetite. On an annual basis, the Board agrees the principal and emerging risks facing the Group and a robust risk management governance framework is in place which enables the Group to effectively prioritise and manage risk to within our risk appetite levels. The Board carries out a review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems at least annually.\n\nThe Group's risk management governance framework has been designed using a three lines of defence (3LOD) model which has been implemented to ensure there is clear ownership and delegation of responsibility for the management and oversight of risk to support the appropriate flow of information throughout the Group.\n\nAn overview of the Group's risk management governance structure along with the key responsibilities within it is outlined in the diagram on page 95.",

The Board also ensures an appropriate risk appetite has been set and consider how the Group's longer-term viability may be impacted by the crystallisation of one or more of these risks.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nResponsibility has been delegated to the Audit Committee by the Board to provide structured and systematic oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. It reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems throughout the year. The Chairman reports to the Board on its activities regarding audit matters and risk management. See pages 131-136 for a description of the risk management activities conducted by the Audit Committee in 2022.\n\n## Risk Oversight Committee (ROC)\n\nThe ROC supports the Audit Committee in the risk management process through ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the risk environment and the controls in place to manage those risks, in addition to the consideration of emerging risks which may impact the Group in the future. The ROC is comprised of senior leadership and is chaired by the CFO. The ROC maintains the Group risk register and provides regular updates on changes in the principal or emerging risks to the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\n## Executive Management\n\nExecutive management is responsible for the effective operation of internal controls, designed to manage and mitigate the Group's principal risks and uncertainties. The 3LOD model ensures accountability for risk management is embedded into global processes and procedures. Key management committees support risk management including the Group Finance Committee, the ICT Security Steering Committee, the Business Integrity Committee, the Global Sustainability Council, and the Quality, Safety, Health and Environment Leadership Team.\n\n## 1st LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nOperational Management is responsible for risk identification, managing the internal control environment and monitoring changes in the risk profile of the Group.\n\n## 2nd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup functional teams ensure the first line is operating as designed, manage performance reviews, internal control verifications and facilitate risk assessments. This includes the Quality, Health & Safety, Information & Cyber Security, Legal and Financial Control functions.\n\n## 3rd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup Internal Audit function along with other external assurance providers perform reviews which provide independent assurance over the operation of the internal control framework, risk management systems and governance processes.",

        "page_content": "## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Process\n\nOur ERM process is embedded across the Group to support the delivery of our strategic objectives, and our annual risk assessment is an integral part of this process. This risk assessment incorporates a group-wide top down and bottom up evaluation to determine the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact of risks on the Group at a residual level. Input is obtained from senior business and functional management through a series of workshops, one-to-one interviews and surveys, which are consolidated to produce the Group Risk Register. Our risk universe forms the basis of conversations and additional new and emerging risks are added as they are identified and assessed. A standard risk scoring methodology has been devised to provide context and ensure consistency in reporting and evaluation of risks.\n\nThe output from this process is consolidated to determine the principal risks and uncertainties for the Group. Executive Management and the ROC review and validate these risks, providing further input where necessary before submission to the Audit Committee and Board for final consideration and approval.\n\nDuring the year the ROC and the Board considered the Group's principal risks in the context of our risk appetite. Whilst our appetite for risk will vary over time, in general we maintain a balanced approach to risk, considering our risk appetite across five categories varying from risk averse to risk seeking. Our approach is to minimise exposure to reputational, financial and operational risk, while accepting and recognising a risk and reward tradeoff in pursuit of our strategic and commercial objectives.\n\nAs a world-leading provider of taste and nutrition solutions for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical markets, the integrity of our business is critical and cannot be put at risk. Consequently, we have a zero tolerance for risks that could harm our people, impact food safety or result in non-compliance with laws and regulations. Conversely, we operate in a challenging and highly competitive market place and as a result, recognise that strategic, commercial and investment risks will be required to seize opportunities and deliver business results. We are therefore prepared to make certain financial and operational investments in pursuit of growth objectives, accepting the risk that the anticipated benefits from these investments may not always be fully realised. Our acceptance of risk is subject to ensuring that potential benefits and risks are fully understood and appropriate measures to mitigate those risks are established.\n\nEach of the Group's principal risks is assigned an executive owner who is responsible for ensuring mitigating actions are sufficient to bring risks to within the agreed appetite and the 3LOD model ensures that these mitigations and internal controls are embedded and operate effectively throughout the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe annual Board and Audit Committee agendas include a series of updates from executive risk owners in relation to the Group's principal risks. These deep dive updates include the history of the risk to date, key mitigating actions and controls, an outline of the residual risk and any future actions planned to address perceived or potential control weaknesses.\n\nThe Audit Committee also receive regular updates on risk management and internal control effectiveness from the Head of Internal Audit (HIA) along with agreed mitigating actions to resolve any weaknesses identified.\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board formally approved the principal risks and associated risk appetites and have confirmed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 130 that a robust assessment of the Group's principal and emerging risks was completed, including those risks that could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity of the Group.\n\n## Principal and Emerging Risks\n\nThe table on pages 98-104 describes the principal risks and uncertainties, which the Board has determined could impact the achievement of strategic objectives and have been identified through the risk assessment process, as well as the mitigating actions in place and an update on any change in the profile of each risk during the year. Additionally, each risk has been linked to our Value Creation Framework as outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 32-35. These risks form the basis of Board and Audit Committee communications and discussions.",

Likewise, some of the current risks may reduce in importance as management actions are implemented or changes in the operating environment occur. The Board will continue to monitor risk in the context of relevant factors such as an increased level of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in some markets, growth through geographic expansion and ongoing acquisitions, as well as other changes in the external environment, which may create future risks.\n\n## Climate Risk\n\nThe Board recognises the significant risks posed by climate change and in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting requirements, the Group has considered climate-related impacts over a number of time horizons and different temperature pathways as outlined on pages 80-81.\n\nOver the last two years a significant programme of work has been completed, guided by an Executive-led steering committee, to assess the impact of climate risk for the Group. This assessment focused on both physical risks, associated with either acute or chronic climate driven events, and transition risks associated with the shift to a lower carbon economy. Given the nature of these risks they were considered from a short-term (five years), medium-term (c. 2030) and longer-term (up to 2050) perspective. The approach is integrated with the overall Group ERM process and risks were assessed on the basis of likelihood, impact and velocity.\n\nThe focus in 2022 has been to evolve our understanding and quantification of climate-related risks and opportunities. An expert external partner was engaged who, in partnership with senior executives, used various models and scenario analysis to identify the potential financial impacts to our business. Further detail with regard to the process and scenarios examined as part of the assessment are outlined in the TCFD section on pages 74-85.\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability (GNS) Committee plays a lead role in both supporting and overseeing the Group's actions in response to climate change. The Audit Committee also plays a role in assessing how climate-related risks have been reviewed and accounted for as part of the risk management and financial reporting process in addition to reviewing and approving the Group's climate-related disclosures.\n\n## Changes to our Principal Risks\n\nWhile there has been no significant change in the principal risks in the last year, the Group operates in a dynamic environment where risks continue to evolve and the Group continues to develop mitigation measures to address them.\n\nWhilst the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided, the Group continued to see the impacts in some markets, particularly China, where localised restrictions during the year resulted in some disruption to supply chains and impacted customer demand. As in previous years, we prioritised protecting the safety and wellbeing of our people at all times and worked with our customers to support them as they navigated the disruption caused by the restrictions.\n\nThe global inflationary environment has been amplified by the geopolitical volatility caused by the invasion of Ukraine. This has resulted in macroeconomic uncertainty in some of the markets in which we operate, and inflation has adversely impacted energy pricing, commodity costs and supply chains. As a result, we have extended the scope of Geopolitical/Emerging Markets risk to incorporate Macroeconomic Environment risk. Our management teams are closely monitoring the situation and continue to demonstrate agility and an ability to take appropriate mitigating actions to secure raw materials, maintain production and provide a reliable supply to our customers. We have worked closely with our customers to manage the significant inflationary environment and continue to support them in developing their offerings to meet the rapidly evolving marketplace.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nEmerging risks are considered as part of the risk assessment process and are identified through horizon scanning, continual dialogue with the business and keeping abreast of market and industry changes. Due to the inherent nature of such risks, they can be difficult to quantify given the lack of data or longer time horizons. A summary of emerging risks which are identified through this process is presented to the Audit Committee and the Board for assessment and these risks continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing risk management processes. Emerging risks we are monitoring include key material and energy availability, endemic COVID-19, ESG regulatory changes, labour model disruption and technology innovation and disruption.",

In assessing the prospects of the Group and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due, the Board has taken account of the Group's medium term strategic planning cycle, capital investment plans, the business model, its diverse portfolio and the innovation pipeline. The Directors have also considered the Group's strong cash generation and debt maturity profile in addition to the principal risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 95-104. This included a consideration of the\n\n## Scenario Modelled\n\n## Scenario 1: External and Macroeconomic Risks\n\nDepressed economic performance, ongoing inflationary and interest rate increases, prolonged global supply chain disruption, political unrest\n\n## Scenario 2: Climate Change and Environmental Risk*\n\nImpacts of extreme weather events, water stress or other climate-related physical or transition risks\n\n## Scenario 3: One-off Expense\n\nImpact of a catastrophic event such as a large-scale cyber attack, significant product contamination or disruption to operations\n\npotential impact of climate-related risks on profitability and liquidity. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are outlined in the Financial Review on pages 40-46.\n\n## Period of Viability Assessment\n\nThe Board has considered the length of time to be reviewed in the context of the viability assessment. Although the Group's strategic planning cycle covers a period of five years, the Board consider that three years is the most appropriate period to assess the longer-term viability of the Group as current capital expenditure plans, commercial arrangements and financial projections are considered to be more reliable and robust over this period.\n\n## Relevant Principal Risks\n\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Business Acquisition and Divestiture\n- - Geopolitical, Emerging Markets & Macroeconomic Environment\n- - Operational and Supply Chain Resilience\n- - Business Ethics and Social Responsibility\n- - Margin Management\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - People\n- - Intellectual Property\n- - Treasury\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - Operational and Supply Chain Resilience\n- - Margin Management\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Cyber and Information Systems Security\n- - Operational and Supply Chain Resilience\n- - Food Safety, Quality and Regulatory\n- - Business Ethics and Social Responsibility\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - Intellectual Property\n- - Taxation\n- - Treasury\n\n## Assessment of Viability\n\nThe viability of the Group has been assessed, considering the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks and uncertainties as outlined on pages 95-104.\n\nWhile each of the principal risks and uncertainties could have an impact on the Group's performance, three severe but plausible scenarios were modelled that the Board assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. The three scenarios as outlined above were stress tested both individually and in combination to assess their potential impact on the Group's solvency, liquidity and cash flow.\n\nThis analysis indicated that significant liquidity headroom existed in all scenarios tested. In addition, the Board consider that the diverse nature of the Group's geographies, markets, customer base, and product portfolio provide significant mitigation against the impact of a serious business interruption.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nBased on their assessment of prospects and viability, the Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of the assessment.\n\n- * This scenario was modelled based on a three-year time horizon. For a longer-term assessment of climate risk please see the TCFD section of this report on pages 74-85.",

Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRSs and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- -  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- -  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- -  state that the financial statements comply with IFRS and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and\n- -  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps adequate accounting records which correctly explain and record the transactions of the Company, enabling at any time the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company to be determined with reasonable accuracy and ensuring that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRSs and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, comply with the Companies Act 2014 and as regards to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and enable the financial statements to be audited.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group's website kerry.com. Irish legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules, the Directors are required to include a management report containing a fair review of the business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The Directors are also required by applicable law and the Listing Rules issued by Euronext Dublin and the UK Listing Authority to prepare a Directors' Report and reports relating to Directors' remuneration and corporate governance.",

On behalf of the Board, I can confirm that for the year under review the Group has complied with all Provisions of the Code other than Provision 38 (alignment of pension contributions) and Provision 19 (chair tenure). For further information refer to the Compliance Statement on page 121.\n\nThe Board sets the tone and shared values for the way in which the Group operates and recognises the importance of culture to the success of the business model. During 2022, the Board continued to assess and monitor the Group's culture to ensure that it is aligned with the Group's strategy and values and is adequately embedded across the Group.\n\nAs a Board, we recognise the benefits of understanding the views of all our stakeholders and we ensure that their interests are taken into account in Board discussions\n\nand decision making. Details of stakeholder engagement activities during the year, including the work of the designated Workforce Engagement Director, are outlined on pages 122-126.\n\nThe Board, in conjunction with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, ensures that there are robust plans in place to facilitate Board, executive and senior management succession. During 2022, the Board appointed me as Chairman and undertook a formal process to recruit a new nonExecutive Director, who brings skills and experience that are reflective of the Group's dairy heritage. Details of the Chairman, non-Executive Director and Committee changes that occurred during the year, are set out in the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee Report on page 141.\n\nThe Board recognises its role in providing guidance and strategic oversight in relation to the implementation of the Group's Beyond the Horizon 2030 sustainability strategy. During the year the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee monitored how the implementation of the 2030 sustainability strategy was progressing, reviewed performance achieved versus agreed sustainability-related commitments and targets, and considered the enhanced environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting disclosures included in the 2022 Annual Report and the separate 2022 Sustainability Report available for review on kerry.com. The Committee also considered the increasing stakeholder expectations and enhanced reporting requirements relating to ESG matters that need to be addressed now and into the future.\n\nDiversity at Board level has been a focus for the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee for a number of years and also continues to be a key factor when considering Board refreshment. During 2022, the\n\nCommittee also monitored the progress made against the diversity targets at senior management level to ensure the appropriate level of skills and diversity exists to support the delivery of the Group's strategy and financial targets. Diversity at Board level in terms of gender, nationality and ethnic background have all improved in recent years. The Board now has a 33% female representation and plans to increase this further in the future.\n\nThe Group has committed to achieving equal gender representation across all senior management roles by 2030. Improving and monitoring diversity beyond gender and below Board level will continue to be a key area of focus for the Board and Executive Management in 2023.\n\nEach year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its effectiveness and that of its Committees. In 2022, the evaluation was externally facilitated and the outcome of this review is that the Board and its Committees consider that they are performing effectively. Details of the process and the resulting actions from this review are outlined on page 129.\n\nDetails of the Group's activities and the operations of the Board, contained in the following report, outline the manner in which the Group has achieved compliance with the Code through the activities and operations of the Board and its Committees during the year.\n\nTom Moran Chairman of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

Board papers are issued to each Director at least one week in advance of Board meetings and include the meeting agenda, minutes of the previous Board meeting and all papers relevant to the agenda. The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, has primary responsibility for setting the agenda for each meeting. All Directors continually receive comprehensive reports and documentation on all matters for which they have responsibility to allow them to fulfil their duties as a Director. All Directors participate in strategy discussion, trading updates, financial performance, significant risks and operational activities in addition to discussion on the Group's purpose, vision, values and culture. Board meetings are of sufficient duration to ensure that all agenda items and any other material non-agenda items that may arise are adequately addressed. In addition to formal meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer maintain regular contact with all Directors. The Chairman holds informal meetings or calls with non Executive Directors without the Executive Directors to discuss issues affecting the Group.\n\nAll Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on governance matters. In accordance with an agreed procedure, in the furtherance of their duties, each Director has the authority to engage independent professional advice at the Company's expense.\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn 2021, the Board collaborated with Executive Management in the development of the Group's updated strategy and associated mid-term financial targets. During 2022, the Board monitored progress implementing the strategies for volume growth, margin expansion and return on investment that underpin the strategic plan.\n\nThe Board also oversaw and approved the strategic M&A transactions during the year including the potential sale of the Sweet Ingredients portfolio. The Board also oversaw and approved the decision to exit all Group activities in Russia and Belarus as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresentations were received from the Company's advisors throughout the year on matters such as the general economic outlook, the impact of the energy crisis, the outlook for emerging and developed markets, Corporate Governance developments, the general M&A landscape as well as corporate defence and shareholder activism. Through these reviews and ongoing discussions on strategy, the Board is confident that Kerry's strategic priorities and key growth platforms will continue to be the key drivers of organic growth and acquisition investment in the future.\n\nThe Board ensures that the decisions it makes are aligned with the achievement of the Group's strategy, are made in the long-term interest of the Group and its stakeholders and are aligned with the Group's sustainability strategy. This is particularly the case when deciding how to prioritise the allocation of resources (human and financial capital) across competing research and development activities, acquisition opportunities and major capital expenditure projects.\n\nDuring the year, the Board also reviewed the business model and how it is executed. The Board is satisfied that the business model is both sustainable in the long-term and optimally structured to enable delivery of the Group's strategy. Details of the Group's strategy are outlined in Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 34-35.\n\n## Purpose, Values and Culture\n\nOur Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life underpins our culture and is reflected in our values.\n\nThe Group's purpose is guided by the Group's Vision to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition.

The Board is led by the Group's purpose during its discussions and when making decisions on the matters that are reserved for its consideration. The Group's Values of Ownership, Inclusiveness and Courage were very much in mind when we made the decision to exit all Group operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our Purpose of Nourishing Life guided our actions as we supported our Ukrainian colleagues and their families in the immediate aftermath of the invasion and beyond.

This Provision has been complied with from 1 January 2023 when Executive Directors' pension contributions were aligned with those available to the wider workforce in Ireland. This timeline was agreed as part of the overall policy review completed in 2021 and is a timeline acceptable to the investment community as well as proxy advisers; and\n- -  Provision 19 (chair tenure). Mr. Philip Toomey was appointed as Chair in 2018 after having served over six years as a non-Executive Director. Philip retired from the Board at the AGM in April 2022 after having served over ten years. Provision 19 requires the Chair to serve no longer than nine years and therefore for a period during the year up to April 2022 Kerry did not comply with this provision. However the Provision also notes that to facilitate effective succession planning this period can be extended, particularly where the Chair was an existing non-Executive Director on appointment.

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nThe Board acknowledges the need to have regard for the interests of all stakeholders in their discussions and decision making. Enhanced engagement with stakeholders enables better informed decision making, thereby increasing the likelihood of long-term sustainable success for the Company. The Board also recognises the need to maintain high standards of business conduct in its actions and decisions. Details of our stakeholder engagement are set out below.\n\n## Shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Why we Engage\n\nActive engagement with shareholders ensures they are aware of the Group's business environment, strategy, business model, performance and sustainability commitments. The views of our shareholders help to inform the strategic decision making of the Board.\n\n## How we Engage\n\nThe Board ensures it has an effective channel of communication with existing and potential shareholders.\n\nThe Investor Relations team and Executive Management maintain ongoing engagement with the investment community, through a variety of different mediums including investor meetings and conferences, investor events, ongoing investor calls and correspondence.\n\nDuring 2022, meetings were held with approximately 1,000 investors. Kerry's Investor Relations team and Executives participated at nineteen investor conferences and external investor events as well as hosting seven investor events at Kerry facilities.\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of published material including results releases, presentations, share price information and news releases are accessible to all shareholders on the Group's website kerry.com.\n\nShareholder presentations are made at the time of release of the Group's full year, half year and interim management statements, following which the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provide the Board with an update on feedback received.\n\nThe Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides an opportunity for the Directors to deliver presentations and to answer questions from shareholders, both institutional and private.\n\n## Key Outputs from the Engagement\n\nKey topics for shareholders included progress on the execution of the Group's strategic plan and related portfolio developments, Group performance and outlook, managing the elevated inflationary environment, the implications of the invasion of Ukraine on the Group and the actions taken, marketplace dynamics and industry consolidation, in addition to sustainability strategy, climate change transition and ESG disclosures.\n\n## Our Actions and their Impacts\n\nRegular updates are provided by the Chief Financial Officer and Head of Investor Relations to the Board on matters raised by the investment community during the year, as well as updates on the composition of the Group's share register.\n\nDuring the year our Chairman, Tom Moran consulted with a number of large institutional shareholders and with the major proxy advisors. When necessary, Committee Chairs engage with shareholders on specific topics. Arising from the matters discussed, feedback is provided to the Directors to inform decision making.\n\nThe 2022 AGM was held in person for the first time in two years following the lifting of restrictions. All Committee Chairs attended the AGM. At the meeting shareholders were able to engage with the Directors in person, ask questions, provide feedback and raise matters of interest.\n\nIn order to give shareholders a greater understanding of Kerry's business model, as well as its unique positioning within the industry, it was agreed to hold seven tailored investor events during 2022 at Group facilities in each of the three geographic regions. The Board participated in a customer immersion experience in advance of one such event. Following their participation, Board members provided feedback and input which informed the content and approach for the following investor events.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the industry landscape and the Group's positioning within the industry. The Board also monitors the progress made in the execution of the Group's strategy. All capital allocation decisions made by the Board are aligned to strategy and the Group's strategic priorities of Taste, Nutrition and Emerging Markets. Successful delivery of the Group's strategy promotes the long-term success of the Group and will also benefit shareholders, employees and the communities in which it operates. When approving the potential sale of the Sweet Ingredients Portfolio, the Board agreed it would support the Group's strategy of focusing on opportunities where Kerry can add the most value.",

Details of these activities are outlined on page 126.\n\nThroughout the year, the Group undertakes regular two-way listening activities with our 23,000+ employees including Town Hall meetings and career development discussions. The Group also has a Speak Up facility to enable employees and other stakeholders to confidentially report matters of concern so that timely and appropriate action can be taken.\n\nEach year the Group runs an employee engagement survey. This year, 92% of our employees participated in the survey which was followed by leader-led listening sessions to discuss strengths, opportunities for continued improvement and to agree action plans for 2023.\n\nIn addition, two interim Leader Pulse Checks were completed, one targeting our plant leadership and a second targeting senior leadership across the Group.\n\nIn line with our engagement strategy, the Group continued its focus on building the effectiveness and impact of our leaders through our Learning and Leadership Academies and manager effectiveness programmes in 2022. Through the provision of coaching to leaders and sharing access to thought leadership content, we have continued to build a positive and inclusive environment at Kerry.\n\nOur Health and Wellbeing framework is underpinned by a balanced set of programmes accessible to our employees across our four wellbeing pillars; Emotional, Physical, Nutritional and Financial.\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued to build improved communication channels with employees through a dedicated digital employee communication platform.\n\n## Key Outputs from the Engagement\n\nKey topics for employees included Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DI&B), learning and development, understanding how employees' roles contribute to the Group's success and the simplification of our ways of working.\n\n## Our Actions and their Impacts\n\nIn appointing Dr. Karin Dorrepaal as the new designated Workforce Engagement Director, the Board sought to select a director with a keen interest in employee matters, particularly in relation to gender diversity and equality. Karin provided regular feedback to the Board on employee engagement activities and general employee sentiment which informed decisions made.\n\nThe Board provided feedback on the global priorities and plans to address the matters raised by employees as part of the employee engagement survey and the two Leader Pulse Checks.\n\nThe Board also received regular updates from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer on the health, safety and wellbeing of employees. In line with our Safety First, Quality Always ethos, the Board ensured that the Group prioritised the safety and wellbeing of our Ukrainian employees and their families following the invasion of their country as well as our Chinese employees as they managed through the ongoing impact of Covid-19. The Board also considered the implications for Kerry employees in Russia and Belarus when deciding to exit all Group activities in those countries. In approving the potential sale of the Group's Sweet Ingredients Portfolio, the Board considered the implications for the employees working in the business and ensured that appropriate actions were taken to mitigate the impact on the employees involved.\n\nThe Board contributed to and participated in many of the 50 th anniversary celebrations that took place throughout 2022. This was a unique opportunity to celebrate the Group's evolution by highlighting the significant contributions to Kerry's success by our employees.\n\nThe Board requested and received feedback on how the Group is supporting employees, in particular those in lower-paid positions or based in hyperinflationary countries, through the cost of living crisis and took this into account when approving the 2023 budget.\n\nThe Board continues to prioritise DI&B and in 2022, the Group established a Global DI&B Council which includes representatives from our Leadership Team and confirmed the appointment of a dedicated role in 2023 to build on the momentum created to date and increase the impact of this agenda going forward for our people, our business, our customers and our communities. The Board also ensured that appropriate resources were available for training and development, internal communications and initiatives that help to simplify the Group's ways of working. Finally, the Group's Inclusion Index is a measure of how employees feel connected, valued and recognised within the organisation. In 2022, we saw an overall increase of 2 percentage points reflecting our continued focus on improving in this area.\n\nDetails of employee engagement activities are outlined in Our People on pages 18-25, the Sustainability Review on pages 52-93 and the separate Sustainability Report which can be found on the Group's website.",

        "page_content": "## Customers and Consumers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Why we Engage\n\nStrong engagement with customers and consumers enables Kerry to operate a customer-centric business model and helps Kerry achieve our Vision to become our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition.\n\n## How we Engage\n\nKerry operates a proven customer-centric business model that enables us to work side-by-side with customers as their co-creation partner of choice.\n\nThe Group interacts with customers on a daily basis at multiple levels from dedicated relationship and account managers, customer and industry conferences as well as tailored innovation forums. Our market research and consumer insight teams study consumer behaviours and perceptions and share these insights with our customers. By way of example, in September 2022, the Group hosted a foodservice sustainable nutrition conference in London during which we worked with our customers to identify how we can help them to develop solutions to meet evolving consumer needs in relation to nutrition. This cross-functional and multi-level engagement is central to how we evolve and maintain holistic innovation partnerships with our customers.\n\nThrough collaboration and innovation, the Group helped customers to make healthier and more sustainable products in response to changing consumer needs. This includes assisting customers to enhance the nutritional profile of their products and to reduce food waste.\n\nThe Group also partnered with customers to reduce complexity and preparation times in the face of labour and water shortages and carbon challenges.\n\nThe Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute \u00ae (KHNI) shares Kerry's scientific expertise and advances awareness of the science of healthier food. Supported by an independent Scientific Advisory Council, KHNI is providing access to those within the sector to scientific knowledge and nutrition insights from the Group's scientists, academics and other experts, as they explore challenges in the food and beverage industry.\n\n## Key Outputs from the Engagement\n\nRapidly evolving, consumer dynamics and the changing marketplace set a backdrop for ongoing customer engagement. Increased demand for innovative, sustainable nutrition solutions, including those that enhance health and wellbeing, plant protein options, and products addressing a diverse range of environmental and sustainability criteria.\n\nKey topics for customers and consumers included the management of the elevated inflationary cost environment, the ongoing impact of global end-to-end supply chain challenges as well as changing consumer needs and preferences.\n\nOur customers want innovative sustainable nutrition solutions that enhance health and wellbeing while reducing the impact that their production activities has on the planet and in particular on climate change and reducing food waste.\n\n## Our Actions and their Impacts\n\nFeedback from customer engagement activities was discussed at each Board meeting as part of the business updates provided by the Executive Directors and informed the decisions made by the Board.\n\nThe Board approved the Group's expenditure of \u20ac303m on research and development applications and technical support. Together with the management team, the Board ensures that this resource is focused on those projects that can best meet customers' needs and thereby enable the Group to achieve its purpose and strategic objectives in relation to revenue growth, margin expansion and return on investment. A strategically resourced Kerry R&D team helps customers to create healthier more nutritious products that taste great, assists them to navigate through the current period of significantly heightened inflation and enables them to produce food products in a more environmentally-sustainable manner. Arising from this investment in research and development, during the year, the Group launched two tools to enable customers to calculate both the nutritional profile of their products ( Kerry Nutri Guide ) as well as to model the potential benefits of food waste reduction through shelf-life extension ( Kerry Food Waste Estimator ), both of which heighten our customers' understanding of the financial, environmental and social impact of their products.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board approved four acquisitions with a total cost of \u20ac392m and gross capital expenditure of \u20ac255m. The Board also approved the potential sale of the Group's Sweet Ingredients Portfolio. All of these decisions are aligned to the Group's strategic priorities and key growth platforms and support the development of our business to best meet our customer's needs.\n\nThe Board also considers customer engagement matters as part of the overall Group sustainability strategy and together with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, receives updates on these matters from the Group Head of Sustainability. With the increasing importance of environmental and social issues for our customers, the Board ensures that the Group's sustainability strategy is appropriately funded, resourced and integrated into our value proposition.\n\nFurther details are outlined in Our Business Model on pages 26-27, Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 34-35, the Sustainability Review on pages 5293 and the separate 2022 Sustainability Report on the Group's website.\n\n## Consideration of Stakeholder Views in the Decision-Making Process\n\nBy understanding the matters of importance to our stakeholders, the Board can consider their needs and concerns in its decision making. The Board ensures that material decisions, which could impact on stakeholder groups, are taken with due regard to their interests.",

Suppliers can also raise matters of concern via the Group's Speak Up whistleblowing service.\n\nThe Group takes a risk-based approach to supplier assessments to ensure ongoing safety, quality and responsible sourcing.\n\nThe Board receives updates from the CEO, Chief Procurement Officer and the Group Head of Sustainability in relation to the quality and reliability of the Group's supply chain and on matters of interest to suppliers.\n\n## Key Outputs from the Engagement\n\nKey topics for suppliers included human rights, quality and food safety, service levels, business continuity, capacity, cost, innovation and responsible sourcing requirements such as aligning with Kerry's Scope 3 carbon target.\n\nDuring 2022, the ability to supply and the cost of various inputs increased for many suppliers due to a number of factors including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, extreme weather events, global shipping challenges, labour availability and supply and demand volatility challenges.\n\n## Community\n\n## Why we Engage\n\nBy fostering strong relationships with the communities in which we operate, we can help support livelihoods and create a better society whilst protecting the environment.\n\n## How we Engage\n\nKerry engages with community representative bodies, charities and leading non-governmental organisations in all regions in which it operates.\n\nThe Group directly supports a range of community projects through its MyCommunity programme and encourages employees to participate in local initiatives through paid volunteer hours.\n\n## Key Outputs from the Engagement\n\nOutputs include employment and local economic development, social inclusion, access to nutrition, food security and sustainable food production, as well as the opportunity for organisations like Kerry to play a lead role in environmental protection and community support.\n\n## Our Actions and their Impacts\n\nThe Board ensures that long-term sustainable relationships are established with key suppliers on mutually agreed and acceptable terms.\n\nThrough the Group's Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy, the Board also ensures that the organisation works with suppliers who provide raw materials to the required safety and quality standards, produced on a sustainable basis and with the proper regard for the fair treatment of workers across the supply chain.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board approved the funding for the launch of the Evolve Dairy Sustainability Programme which supports the accelerated adoption of sciencebased, sustainable actions and best practice on the farms of our suppliers in Ireland. The impact of this initiative will be to assist our dairy suppliers in Ireland to achieve a reduction in their Carbon Intensity footprint in line with targets set by the Irish Government.\n\nFurther details on our responsible sourcing strategy are outlined in the Sustainability Review on pages 52-93 and the 2022 Sustainability Report on the Group's website.\n\nDuring the year the Board also approved the establishment of an executive Business Integrity Committee which will oversee compliance with the Group's Code of Conduct, thereby further ensuring sound decision making in line with the highest ethical standards including in relation to responsible sourcing. This Committee will also oversee the Group's preparation for compliance with the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence when it is transposed into Irish Law.\n\n## Our Actions and their Impacts\n\nThe Board considers local community engagements as part of the overall Group sustainability strategy.\n\nAs a leader in the food and beverage industry, the Board ensures that the Group is in a position to play a vital role in the global supply chain, providing sustainable nutrition solutions for over a billion consumers in a way that protects people and the environment around us. The Board also prioritises the approval of capital expenditure projects that have a positive environmental impact.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board approved a new four-year partnership with Concern Worldwide to improve food security in Kenya as well as supporting an innovative urban nutrition project in the same country while continuing to support the UN World Food Programme in Burundi. The impact of these initiatives is to enable the development of self-sustaining programmes to promote wellbeing amongst some of the worlds' poorest people.\n\nFurther details of these engagements and the Group's MyCommunity programme are outlined in the Sustainability Review on pages 52-93.",

        "page_content": "## Governance in Action:\n\n## Designated Workforce Engagement Director - Activities in 2022\n\nDr. Karin Dorrepaal assumed the role of designated Workforce Engagement Director in April 2022, succeeding Mr. Tom Moran. When appointing her to the role, the Board was mindful of Karin's keen interest in employeerelated matters, including gender diversity and equality. Due to the timing of this transition, we reduced the number of pre-planned activities during 2022 to provide Karin with an opportunity to shape the agenda in line with her new role and own interests. As a result, Karin participated in fewer focused engagements in 2022. She will however take part in a broader range of employee engagement activities in 2023 in order to assess employee sentiment at various employee levels, across group-wide locations and in different workplace contexts. Details of the employee engagement activities undertaken by Karin during 2022 are outlined below:\n\n- -  attendance and participation at regional and global events on the topic of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, including 'Womxn's Perspectives' an event held in June 2022 highlighting the Group's commitment to the womxn that identify as part of our LGBTQI+ community and Kerry's commitment to equal gender representation in senior management roles by 2030;\n- -  site visit to Utrecht, the Netherlands as part of 'Engagement through the lens of a Kerry Manufacturing Plant' where senior site leaders presented on the core business of the site along with site strategies, employee engagement and potential improvements;\n- -   participation in briefings on employee engagement strategies and progress for businesses and functions across all regions; and\n- -  participation in briefings on employee career development and succession planning for executives as part of the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee agenda.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nAll Directors attend the AGM and are available to meet with shareholders and answer questions as required. Notice of the AGM, proxy statement and the Annual Report and financial statements are sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. A separate resolution is proposed at the AGM on each substantially separate issue including a particular resolution relating to the adoption of the Directors' and Auditors' reports and the financial statements. Details of the proxy votes for and against each resolution, together with details of votes withheld are announced after the result of the votes by hand. These details are published on the Group's website following the conclusion of the AGM. At the AGM held on 28 April 2022, there were no material votes cast against any resolutions.\n\n## Global Priorities for Employee Engagement in 2022\n\nThis year we aligned our engagement focus areas under three pillars: 'Making it Better, Making it Clearer and Making it Easier'. These three pillars will guide how we approach our engagement action planning across Kerry and focus our efforts on improving the working experience for our people.\n\n- -  Making it Better encompasses the actions that impact the working life of everyone at Kerry. Learning and development opportunities, our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging agenda, as well as wellbeing, reward and recognition initiatives all fall under this pillar. Through the survey feedback in 2022, our people shared that they have experienced positive developments in all these areas.\n- -  Making it Clearer covers aspects relating to Kerry's vision, brand and strategy. Following our strategy refresh in 2021, Kerry's senior leadership team invested considerable time and effort throughout 2022 in ensuring that every individual at Kerry understands our strategic objectives and how their role contributes to Kerry's longer-term goals.\n- -  Making it Easier is a hugely important pillar for Kerry. Our relentless drive to work smarter is core to the culture at Kerry. We are realising the benefits of our continued business transformation activities.\n\nDr. Karin Dorrepaal held regular meetings with the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Group Human Resources Team to provide her feedback from the engagement activities. Formal updates were provided by the designated Workforce Engagement Director to the Board at three Board meetings during the year on the activities undertaken and the feedback received from employees. In addition, the Workforce Engagement Director provided input from the employee perspective during all Board discussions and when the Board made key decisions.\n\n## Whistleblowing Arrangements\n\nThe Group's whistleblowing arrangement includes an externally-facilitated multi-lingual hotline Speak Up through which all employees and third parties can raise concerns in confidence about possible wrong doings in financial reporting and other matters, 24 hours a day by phone or online.\n\nAll whistleblowing incidents are reviewed by the Legal and Ethical Compliance team and formally investigated by the relevant functional heads depending on the nature of the concern raised.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee reviewed the whistleblowing incidents and outcomes and provided updates to the Board which enabled the Board to assess the adequacy of the whistleblowing arrangements and to review the reports arising from its operation. The Board is satisfied that the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are operating effectively.",

The purpose of the induction programme is to enable new Directors to gain a full understanding of the Group, governance related matters and Directors' duties and responsibilities. The induction programme includes presentations on the Group's operations and results, meetings with Executive Management and an outline of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. Details of the induction programme undertaken by Ms. Fiona Dawson are outlined in the Governance in Action below.\n\n## Governance in Action (Example):\n\n## New Director Induction\n\nMs. Fiona Dawson was appointed to the Board on 4 January 2022. Following her appointment, Ms. Dawson underwent a formal induction programme which was tailored to her individual requirements and included the following induction activities.\n\n## Induction Activities\n\n- -  provision of a detailed information pack including key corporate governance policies, board papers, financial and strategic documents and information on Directors' duties and responsibilities;\n- - meetings with the Executive Directors;\n- -  meetings with the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee Chairperson, and the Audit Committee Chairman;\n- -  meetings with functional leaders on matters such as board and corporate governance, internal audit, strategy, investor relations, human resources and sustainability;\n- -  meetings with business leaders of the Taste & Nutrition and Dairy Ireland businesses to obtain an overview of each business; and\n- - meetings with external auditors and other advisors;\n\n## Future Induction Activities\n\n- - site visits to see first-hand the Group's operations while engaging with employees and senior management.",

Presentations are also made by Executive Directors and senior management on various topics throughout the year in relation to their areas of responsibility.\n\nOn an annual basis, an 'off-site' Board meeting is scheduled at a Group location and is combined with a comprehensive schedule of activities over a week-long period, to allow non-Executive Directors further develop their understanding of the Group's activities and meet with local senior management and emerging talent. The 'off-site' Board meeting took place during June 2022 in the US at the Group's Technology and Innovation Centre in Beloit, Wisconsin. During the visit to the US the Board had the opportunity to meet and engage with the North American Leadership team and emerging talent in both a formal and informal setting. The Board visited two manufacturing sites, during which Board members met with the site leadership teams and saw first-hand the positive impact of the capital investments at both sites which they had approved. During the visit, the Board also received presentations on the dynamics and priorities of the North American market and participated in a customer immersion experience at the Technology and Innovation Centre which showcased the Group's capabilities in helping customers to solve industry challenges with differentiated solutions.\n\nAs part of their personal development plans, individual non-Executive Directors are also afforded the opportunity to visit a number of the Group's international facilities and operations. The number of visits during 2022 continued to be constrained due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 related restrictions. Individual Board members training requirements are reviewed with the Chairman and Company Secretary and training is provided to address these needs.\n\n## Board Performance Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with provisions of the Code, a performance evaluation of the Board is carried out annually and facilitated externally every third year.\n\nIn 2022, the Board engaged Independent Audit Limited (Independent Audit) to facilitate the performance evaluation. Independent Audit, based in the UK, is recognised as a leading firm of board reviewers, and has no other connections to the Group.\n\nThe review, performed during October and November 2022, considered the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. The evaluation was carried out through the use of an online questionnaire tool hosted by\n\nIndependent Audit and through interviews held between Independent Audit and the Chair, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Independent Director, a further four Board members and the Company Secretary. Independent Audit also reviewed Board papers pertaining to the year and observed meetings of the Board and Committees. The topics covered during the Board Performance Evaluation included Board composition and succession planning, board meetings and papers, strategy and financial oversight, mergers and acquisitions, people and culture, stakeholder engagement, ESG considerations and risk management. A thorough discussion followed a presentation of the findings made to the Board by Independent Audit at the December Board meeting. Each committee also considered the observations specific to their work.\n\nThe Chairman appraised the performance of each of the non-Executive Directors by meeting each Director individually. The key areas reviewed were independence, contribution and attendance at Board meetings, interaction with Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and senior management, ability to communicate issues of importance and concern, their knowledge and effectiveness at meetings and the overall time and commitment to their role on the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Senior Independent Director formally appraised the performance of the Chairman. This appraisal was similar to the non-Executive Director evaluation process which included feedback from all Directors on the Chairman's performance during the year.\n\nDuring the year, the non-Executive Directors met without the presence of the Executive Directors and, led by the Chairman, undertook a formal review of the performance of the individual Executive Directors.\n\nOverall, the Board concluded that the outcomes of the evaluation process have been positive and have confirmed to the Chairman that the Board and its Committees operate effectively and that each Director contributes to the overall effectiveness and success of the Group. The actions identified from the 2022 performance evaluation included recommendations relating to Board and executive succession planning, oversight of the transition plan to Net Zero and the appropriate time allocation between strategic priorities and other matters at Board meetings.\n\nProgress against recommendations from the previous internal evaluation were also considered and the Board is satisfied that improvements have been made which have enhanced the operation and effectiveness of both the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chairman, along with the Company Secretary, will ensure that areas for improvement identified from the 2022 evaluation report and areas for consideration arising from the Directors' appraisal, where identified, will be considered during 2023.",

The work performed by the Audit Committee is described in its report on pages 131-136.\n\nFull details of the risk management systems are described in the Risk Management Report on pages 94-105.\n\nThe principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those that could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity are described on pages 98-104. Emerging risks are also identified, analysed and managed as part of the same process as the Group's other principal risks as described on pages 96-97. The Directors confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of these risks and the actions that are in place to mitigate them.\n\nThe Directors confirm that they have also reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control which operated during the period covered by these financial statements and up to the date of this report. Based on the review performed, the Directors concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group's systems of risk management and internal control were effective. The procedures adopted comply with the guidance contained in Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting as published by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK.\n\n## Features of Internal Control in Relation to the Financial Reporting Process\n\nThe main features of the internal control and risk management systems of the Group in relation to the financial reporting process include:\n\n- -  the Board review and approve a detailed annual budget and monitor performance against the budget through periodic Board reporting;\n- -  prior to submission to the Board with a recommendation to approve, the Audit Committee review the Interim Management Statements, the Interim and Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and all formal announcements relating to these statements;\n- -  adherence to the Group Code of Conduct and Group policies published on the Group's intranet ensures the key controls in the internal control system are complied with;\n- -  monthly reporting and financial review meetings are held to review performance at business level ensuring that significant variances between the budget and detailed management accounts are investigated and that remedial action is taken as necessary;\n- -  the Group has a Financial Compliance function to establish compliance policies and monitor compliance across the countries in which the Group operates;\n- -  the Group operates an internal control self-assessment process covering material finance, operational and compliance controls across the Group;\n- -  a well-resourced and appropriately skilled Finance function is in place throughout the Group;\n- -  completion of key account reconciliations at reporting unit and Group level;\n- -  centralised Taxation and Treasury functions and regional Shared Service Centres established to facilitate appropriate segregation of duties;\n- -  the Group Finance Committee has responsibility for raising finance, reviewing foreign currency risk, making decisions on foreign currency and interest rate hedging and managing the Group's relationship with its finance providers;\n- -  the Board, through the Audit Committee, completes an annual review of the effectiveness of risk management and control systems;\n- -  appropriate ICT security environment; and\n- -  the Internal Audit function continually reviews the internal controls and systems and makes recommendations for improvement which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Fair, Balanced and Understandable\n\nThe Directors have concluded that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and Company's position and performance, business model and strategy and is fair, balanced and understandable. This assessment was completed by the Audit Committee and the activities undertaken in reaching this conclusion are outlined on page 133.",

Maintaining robust internal controls remained a key focus for the Committee, particularly given the volatile external environment.'\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nOn behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present my report for the year ended 31 December 2022. The report outlines how the Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year in relation to oversight of financial and other reporting, internal controls and the risk management process, the Internal Audit function and our relationship and interaction with the external auditor.\n\nThe Committee supported the Board in assessing the principal and emerging risks facing the Group. This included consideration of the climate change risk and together with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability\n\nCommittee we have overseen ongoing enhancements in reporting against the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the EU Taxonomy on pages 7493. The Committee also reviewed the Group's risk management and internal control systems and oversaw the operation of the Internal Audit function.\n\nEach regular meeting included updates on risk and compliance related activities and further details with regard to these matters are set out on page 134.\n\nThe Committee focused on monitoring the integrity of the Group's Financial Statements and announcements relating to the Group's financial and non-financial performance. It reviewed the work completed by management in respect of the Going Concern and Viability Statements, including a consideration of uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, as well as the potential impact of climate-related risks and concluded that there was no threat to the Group's prospects or viability. Further details are set out on pages 104-105. The significant issues that the Committee considered in relation to the financial statements and how these issues were addressed are set out on page 133.\n\nThe Committee has satisfied itself, and advised the Board accordingly, that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, when taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the relationship with the external auditor, including monitoring all matters associated with their appointment, remuneration, performance and independence.\n\nFollowing a detailed planning process, PwC conducted a hybrid working model for the 2022 audit, working both on site and virtually, and the Committee reviewed the scope and results of the audit and the effectiveness of the process. The work completed in this regard is outlined on page 135.\n\nAs outlined on page 136, the Committee considered the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 in relation to the Directors' Compliance Statement and is satisfied that appropriate steps have been undertaken by the Company to ensure that it is materially compliant with its relevant obligations.\n\nAn external review of the Committee was conducted by Independent Audit Limited (Independent Audit) during 2022 and the outcome of this review was that the Committee was satisfied that it is operating effectively. Further details are set out on page 132.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, the Committee's primary focus will remain as providing effective oversight of the Group's financial reporting, risk management and internal control processes. The Committee will also take a proactive approach in anticipating and preparing for upcoming legislative and regulatory changes, particularly in the area of climate change and sustainability.\n\nI trust you will find this report useful in understanding the operation and activities of the Committee during the year and I welcome any comments from shareholders on the report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristopher Rogers\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

        "page_content": "## Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe main roles and responsibilities of the Committee, which reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Irish Annex and the Guidance on Audit Committees, are set out in its written Terms of Reference which are available in the governance section of the Group's website kerry.com or upon request.\n\nThe primary responsibilities outlined in the terms of reference are included in the table below:\n\n## Primary Responsibilities of the Audit Committee\n\n- -  Monitoring the integrity of the Group's financial statements, including reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained in them;\n- -  Reviewing the Interim Management Statements, the Interim and Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and considering the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices;\n- -  Advising the Board on whether it believes there are any material uncertainties which may impact the Group's ability to continue as a going concern or the Group's long-term viability;\n- -  Advising the Board on whether the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, when taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable;\n- -  Assisting the Board in its responsibilities in regard to the assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Group, the monitoring of risk management and internal control systems, including a review of effectiveness;\n- -  Reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function;\n- -  Making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the Group's external auditor as well as monitoring their effectiveness and independence;\n- -  Reviewing, on behalf of the Board, the Group's whistleblowing arrangements for its employees and third parties to raise concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoings in financial reporting or other matters; and\n- -  Advising the Board in relation to compliance with stock exchange and other legal or regulatory requirements.\n\n## Committee Membership\n\nThe Audit Committee currently comprises five independent non-Executive Directors; Dr. Hugh Brady, Ms. Emer Gilvarry, Mr. Jinlong Wang, Mr. Michael Kerr and is chaired by Mr. Christopher Rogers.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that both Mr. Christopher Rogers and Mr. Michael Kerr meet the specific requirements for recent and relevant financial experience as set out in the Code.\n\nThe Board is also satisfied that together, the members of the Committee, as set out in their biographical details on pages 108-110, bring a broad range of relevant skills, experience and expertise, from a wide variety of industries and backgrounds, and as a whole have competence relevant to the sectors in which the Group operates. The Company Secretary is the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n## Committee Meetings\n\nThe Committee met six times during the year and attendance at these meetings is outlined on page 128. Typically, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller, the Company Secretary and the Head of Internal Audit, as well as representatives of the external auditor are invited to attend meetings of the Committee. In addition, the Chairman of the Board attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee. When required, other key executives and senior management are invited to attend, to present and provide deeper insight on various topics as are required by the Committee to discharge its duties.\n\nThe external auditor and the Head of Internal Audit have direct access to the Committee Chairman at all times and meet with the Committee, without other Executive Management being present, on a formal basis at least annually in order to provide an additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback.\n\nMeetings are scheduled to align with the Group's reporting cycle and after each Committee meeting, the Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board on the key issues which have been discussed.\n\n## Committee Evaluation\n\nAs outlined in detail on page 129, Independent Audit, an external consultancy firm, conducted a review of the Committee as part of the Board's external performance review. The evaluation was carried out through the use of an online questionnaire and through interviews held between Independent Audit and the Chair, two Committee members and the Company Secretary. In addition, as part of the evaluation process, Independent Audit observed the October Committee meeting and corresponding papers. The output of the review was discussed at the December meeting following which the Committee concluded that it continued to operate effectively and efficiently throughout the year and has the skills and expertise required to perform its role appropriately. The review also identified a number of ongoing areas of focus for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Financial Reporting and Significant Areas of Focus\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the Interim Management Statements, the Interim and Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and all formal announcements relating to these statements before submitting them to the Board of Directors with a recommendation to approve. These reviews focused on, but were not limited to:\n\n- -  the appropriateness and consistency of accounting policies and practices;\n- -  the going concern assumption;\n- -  compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and corporate governance and regulatory requirements as well as the clarity and completeness of disclosures; and\n- -  considering the significant areas of complexity, management judgement and estimation that had been applied in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting policies.",

All matters arising from this review have been concluded satisfactorily.\n\nThe Committee considered the impact of climate change on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and agreed that the disclosures outlined on pages 74-85 made in response to the recommendations of the\n\n## Significant Areas of Focus\n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\n\nGoing Concern and Viability Statement\n\nTaxation\n\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, as disclosed in note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, represents the largest number on the Group balance sheet at \u20ac4.9 billion. The Committee considered the process to complete the annual impairment review of the Group's goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and specifically the assumptions used for the future cash flows, discount rates, terminal values and growth rates. This included consideration of the impact of climate change and other external and macroeconomic risks on such assessments and a consideration of the sensitivity analysis run by management. Following discussions with senior management and the external auditor, the Committee found that the methodology used for the above valuation and annual impairment review is appropriate and no impairment was identified.\n\nThe Committee assessed the effectiveness of the process undertaken by management to evaluate going concern and longer-term viability, which included reviewing and challenging management's assumptions and modelling of projected cash flows and in particular, those related to the potential impact of climate-related risks on profitability and liquidity on future trading performance. The Committee also considered the Group's financing facilities and future funding plans. Based on this, the Committee confirmed there were no material uncertainties that cast a significant doubt on the Group or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate and recommended the approval of the viability statement.\n\nSignificant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required when arriving at the Group's tax charge and liability. The Committee, in conjunction with tax professionals, reviewed and discussed the basis for the judgments in relation to uncertain tax positions and challenged management on their assertions and also considered the outcome of the external auditors' review of the tax charge and liability. As a result, the Committee believes the impact of uncertain tax positions has been appropriately reflected in the tax charge and liability.\n\n## Fair, Balanced and Understandable\n\nAt the request of the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the content of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nIn fulfilling this responsibility, the Committee considered the following:\n\n- -  the timetable for the co-ordination and preparation of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, including key milestones as presented at the December Audit Committee meeting;\n- -  the systematic approach to review and sign-off carried out by senior management with a focus on consistency and balance; and\n- -  a detailed report from senior finance management outlining the process through, which they assessed the narrative and financial sections of the 2022 Annual Report to ensure that the criteria of fair, balanced and understandable has been achieved.\n\nManagement ensured that the draft Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements were available to the Audit Committee in sufficient time for review in advance of the Committee meeting to facilitate adequate discussion at the meeting.\n\nHaving considered the above, in conjunction with the consistency of the various elements of the reports, the narrative reporting and the language used, the Committee confirmed to the Board that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the EU Taxonomy are appropriate and that the assumptions used in the financial statements as outlined in note 1 are consistent with these disclosures.\n\nThe Committee has, with the support of PwC as external auditor, reviewed the suitability of the accounting policies which have been adopted and whether management have made appropriate judgements and disclosures. The table below sets out the significant matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.",

A detailed overview of the Group's risk management framework is set out in the Risk Management Report on pages 94-97.\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties, including climate change and other emerging risks, that could impact the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives as described on pages 98-104;\n- -  reviewed and approved the risk appetite for each of the Group's principal risks and recommended the risk appetites as outlined for approval by the Board;\n- -  received presentations from senior executives on a selection of principal risks, which included two cybersecurity updates as well as an update on the Group's processes to manage sourcing and pricing risk in a period of record inflation and significant supply chain disruption;\n- -  reviewed quarterly reports from the Head of Internal Audit based on internal audits completed outlining noncompliances with Group controls and managements' action plans to address them;\n- -  considered reports from the Head of Internal Audit on fraud investigations or other significant control matters which occurred during the year and approved plans to address and remediate the issues identified;\n- -  received updates from the Group Financial Controller on any control weaknesses identified through monthly financial review meetings;\n- -  received updates from the sustainability team on ongoing progress related to the assessment of climate-related risks and disclosures;\n- -  engaged with management on the Group's response to the unfolding crisis in the Ukraine both in relation to supporting employees and their families based there and managing other risks arising as a result of the conflict;\n- -  considered the results of the Kerry Control SelfAssessment (the internal control self-assessment review of material finance, operational and compliance controls) and concluded that the controls are operating effectively;\n- -  received a detailed report from the Head of Internal Audit outlining the Group's risk management and internal control framework in line with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting and incorporating all material financial, operational and compliance controls; and\n- -  reviewed the report from the external auditor in respect of significant financial accounting and reporting issues, together with internal control weakness observations.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Board also received an update from ICT management with regard to the Group's ICT governance and information security programme and its ability to address cybersecurity threats particularly in the context of its criticality to the business and an increase in the global risk level. Further detail with regard to the Group's information systems and cybersecurity controls are outlined on page 102 of the Risk Report.\n\nThe Audit Committee, having assessed the above information, is satisfied that the internal control and risk management framework is operating effectively and has reported this opinion to the Board.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function including its focus, plans, activities and resources. To fulfil these duties the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the Group Internal Audit function's charter, updated strategy and annual plan;\n- -  considered and were satisfied that the competencies, experience and level of resources within the Internal Audit team were adequate to achieve the proposed plan;\n- -  considered the role and effectiveness of Internal Audit in the overall context of the Group's risk management framework and was satisfied that the function has appropriate standing within the Group;\n- -  received quarterly updates from the Head of Internal Audit on the delivery of the 2022 plan and on the principal findings from the work of Internal Audit and management's actions to remediate issues identified;\n- -  received updates on the nature and extent of non-audit activity performed by Internal Audit;\n- -  ensured that the Head of Internal Audit had regular meetings with the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Committee met with the Head of Internal Audit without the presence of Executive Management;\n- -  ensured that the Head of Internal Audit had access to the Chairman of the Board if required; and\n- -  ensured co-ordination between Group Internal Audit and the external auditor to maximise the benefits from clear communication and co-ordinated activities.\n\nIn order to comply with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA) requirements, Deloitte were engaged to conduct an independent external quality assessment of the Internal Audit function during 2022. The objectives of this assessment were to independently assess the effectiveness of the function in line with the International Standards for the Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) of the CIIA and to benchmark it against best practice and peer organisations. The output from the review was presented by Deloitte to the Audit Committee at the July meeting.\n\nThe assessment concluded that Internal Audit is a professional function, incorporating expected industry good practice in line with its peers and conforms with the vast majority of the CIIA standards. In addition, the assessment contained a number of recommendations to be considered to further evolve and strengthen the function's effectiveness.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Committee concluded that for 2022 the Internal Audit function operated effectively and is satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of the function is appropriate for the Group.",

This includes making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence and effectiveness and approving the audit fee.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met with the external auditor without management present to discuss any issues that may have arisen during the audit of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence and Provision of Non-Audit Services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for ensuring that the external auditor is independent and for implementing appropriate safeguards where the external auditor also provides non-audit services to the Group.\n\nPwC confirmed to the Audit Committee that they are independent from the Group under the requirements of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority's Ethical Standards for Auditors. PwC were appointed as the Group's external auditor in 2016 and the Committee will ensure that in accordance with EU legislation in relation to Audit Reform as adopted in Irish legislation, the external auditor is rotated at least once every ten years. The audit lead engagement partner is rotated every five years and for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 is Enda McDonagh who was appointed in 2021 following the rotation of the previous partner.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's policy on the hiring of former employees of the current external auditor, the Committee reviews and approves any appointment of an individual, within three years of having previously been employed by the current external auditor, to a senior managerial position in the Group.\n\nA formal policy governing the provision of nonaudit services by the external auditor is in place and is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee annually. This policy is in accordance with applicable laws and takes into account the relevant ethical guidance for auditors. This policy is designed to safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor and to prevent the provision of services which could result in a potential conflict of auditor independence. The policy outlines the services which can be provided by the external auditor, the relevant approval process for these services, and those services which the external auditor is prohibited from providing.\n\nIn 2022, all non-audit services and fees were approved by the Audit Committee in line with policy. The Committee is satisfied that the non-audit fees paid to PwC, which were minimal, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Full details of the fees paid to the external auditor during the year for nonaudit services are outlined in note 3 to the financial statements. Having considered all of the above, the Committee concluded that the Group's external auditor is independent.\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nPost completion of the 2021 audit, in conjunction with PwC, review meetings were held with senior finance management across all regions and it was confirmed by both parties that no issues had arisen during the audit process. This review considered the process and technology changes which were implemented to support conducting the audit remotely and they were satisfied that it did not compromise the quality of the audit.\n\nAt the October Audit Committee meeting, PwC outlined to the Committee in detail the 2022 external audit plan, which would be conducted on a hybrid basis with a blend of staff working both on site and virtually. The Committee discussed the significant audit risks and key audit matters, audit scope and materiality amongst other matters. The Audit Committee agreed that the plan and the materiality at which any misstatements should be reported by PwC to the Committee was appropriate.\n\nPrior to the finalisation of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Audit Committee received a detailed presentation and final report from PwC. The Committee also considered feedback from the lead partner and senior executives in concluding that PwC effectively delivered against the objectives of the agreed audit plan.\n\nIn assessing the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee also considered the following:\n\n- -  the quality of presentations to the Board and Audit Committee;\n- -  the technical insights provided, relevant to the Group;\n- -  key audit findings, including their robustness and perceptiveness in handling of key accounting and audit judgements; and\n- -  their demonstration of a clear understanding of the Group's business and key risks.\n\nOn the basis of the above the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external auditors.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing a comprehensive tender process overseen by the Audit Committee, PwC were appointed as external auditor in March 2016 and commenced as statutory auditors for the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2016. On an annual basis, the Committee reviews the appointment of the external auditor, taking into account the auditor's effectiveness and independence. On that basis, the Committee recommended to the Board that PwC should continue in office as the auditor to the Group in respect of the year ending 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee approved the remuneration of the external auditor, details of which are set out in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

On the basis of this review, the Committee confirmed to the Board that in its opinion the Company is in material compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Whistleblowing and Fraud Arrangements\n\nIn accordance with the Provisions of the Code, the responsibility for overseeing whistleblowing is within the remit of the Board. During 2022, at the request of the Board, the Committee considered the Group's whistleblowing arrangements and assisted the Board in its assessment of the adequacy of these arrangements. Details of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on page 126.\n\nThe Committee also considered the Group's procedures for fraud prevention and detection to ensure that these arrangements allow for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action. Following this review, the Audit Committee confirmed to the Board that it was satisfied that the Group's fraud prevention procedures were adequate.",

The Committee also reviews the results of the annual Board evaluation process as it relates to the Board and Committee performance and composition. Additionally, the Committee is responsible for monitoring Corporate Governance developments and for providing guidance and oversight on the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nOn 28 April 2022 I was appointed Chairman succeeding Mr. Philip Toomey who retired from the Board on the same date. On behalf of the Board, I wish to pay tribute to Philip for his commitment and dedication to the success of the Group throughout his years of service.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Committee continued to lead the Board refreshment process ensuring that the composition of the Board and its Committees has the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience, diversity and independence. To ensure that the Board has a director that reflects the Group's dairy heritage we engaged with an executive recruitment consulting firm to conduct a search for a new independent non-Executive Director. Potential candidates were considered by the Committee and a shortlist were interviewed after assessing their qualifications against agreed criteria and their other time commitments. This culminated in the appointment of Patrick Rohan to the Board on 16 January 2023. He brings to the Board a detailed knowledge of the dairy and agribusiness industry.\n\nThe Committee also recommended changes to the composition of the Board Committees as outlined on page 141.\n\nDr. Hugh Brady will have served nine years as a director on 23 February 2023. Over this tenure his biomedical research and academic background has brought an invaluable perspective to the Board, as the Group has significantly evolved its science and technology capabilities over the same period. The Committee and the Board have reviewed and considered the provisions of the Code in relation to Directors' tenure and nonetheless having conducted a rigorous review of his independence, unanimously agree that Dr. Brady should, subject to shareholder approval, remain on the Board and as SID until the AGM in April 2024. The Committee and Board are satisfied that Dr. Brady, given his personal attributes and the challenge he continues to bring to Board discussions, will continue to apply objective and independent judgement to act in the best interest of the Company. The Committee is actively engaged in the challenging process to identify and recruit an experienced and high-calibre successor with a similar level of\n\nscience, technology and innovation expertise.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed senior management development and succession plans with regard to business growth, geographic expansion and diversity goals below Board level.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee reviewed the Company's corporate governance policy and processes and monitored developments in corporate governance best practice.\n\nThe Committee also continued to provide guidance and oversight to the Group on the implementation of the Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy, including monitoring progress against agreed targets and considering the enhanced reporting requirements and stakeholder expectations in relation to sustainability matters.\n\nAn externally facilitated review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees was conducted during 2022 and the outcome of this review is that the Board and its Committees consider that they are operating effectively.\n\nThe Committee's priorities for 2023 will continue to focus on Board and Committee refreshment, senior management development and succession planning as well as ongoing oversight of the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy. In this regard, the Committee is considering recommending to the Board, that a standalone Sustainability Committee is established, to focus efforts on this area of significant importance and fast-evolving change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tom Moran\n\nChairman of the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee",

The Board explains to shareholders, in the papers accompanying the resolutions to elect and re-elect the non-Executive Directors, why it believes the individual should be reelected based on the results of the formal performance evaluation. Details of Board refreshment activities during the year are outlined on pages 141-142.\n\n## Nomination Process\n\nThere is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure in appointing new Directors to the Board.

The Board approved the appointment of Mr. Patrick Rohan noting that he had a balance of skills, knowledge and experience that matched the requirements set.

The succession planning process includes defining success criteria for prioritised key roles, identifying and evaluating candidate pools and aligning successor development activities with individual and business needs to ensure leadership continuity and improve the depth of the leadership succession pipeline.\n\nThis process is fully documented and monitored throughout the year in conjunction with the Committee. Details of succession planning activities during the year are outlined in Our People on page 23.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee continued to provide guidance and oversight on the implementation of the Group's 2030 Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy.

We recognise the value that different perspectives and cultures bring to the organisation. Valuing differences creates a work environment which is positive and productive, where people can and want to do their best and where each individual can bring something unique to contribute to the overall success of Kerry.\n\nThe Group's Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy is an integral part of the Group's Code of Conduct ensuring that diversity and inclusion are embedded in Kerry Group's core values. Within this, the Group seeks to recruit, hire and retain the best talent from a diverse mix of gender, background, nationality, ethnicity and other attributes with the skills and experiences to drive innovative thinking to enable a sustained competitive advantage.\n\nThe Board believes in the benefits of having a diverse Board and the value that it can bring to its effective operation. In accordance with the Board Diversity Policy, differences in background, gender, skills, experiences, nationality, ethnicity and other attributes are considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board with the aim to balance it appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, with due regard to diversity. The Board currently has a 33% female representation.

This is my first Remuneration Committee Report, having taken over as Chairperson following Tom Moran's appointment as Chairman of the Board on 28 April 2022.\n\nI would like to thank Tom for his significant contribution to this Committee over the past number of years, firstly as a member and more recently as the Chairman.\n\n2022 has been a milestone year for Kerry as we celebrated our 50 th anniversary and reconnected in person with many of our stakeholders as borders and economies reopened. In the face of a challenging macro-economic and geopolitical backdrop, and through continued COVID-19 lockdowns in key geographies, the Group again delivered a good financial performance for the year and made further significant strategic developments to enhance and solidify Kerry's position as a world-leading provider of taste and nutrition solutions for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical markets.\n\nWe could not have achieved this without the continued and excellent leadership of our Executive Directors, our leadership teams and our entire global workforce who continue to demonstrate tremendous commitment and agility. I would also like to pay special tribute to our Ukrainian colleagues and to our leadership teams who ensured a rapid and coordinated response to keep our colleagues and their families safe as they deal with the consequences of the invasion of their country.\n\n## Supporting our People\n\nWe continue to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our people and throughout 2022, the Committee was particularly cognisant of the volatile economic environment, global inflationary challenges and the associated impact on our people. The Committee is also aware that the current inflationary environment is disproportionally affecting lower-paid workers and therefore, a number of targeted actions have been taken to support our people where required:\n\n- -  Salary increases for the wider workforce in 2023 will be aligned to market movements on a country-by-country basis and will be greater than those awarded last year;\n- -  Greater flexibility has been introduced in the Group's pay review process to facilitate higher increases for lower-paid positions and to give managers greater flexibility to differentiate where pay levels are materially impacted by inflation;\n- -  More frequent salary increases are and will be made in countries experiencing hyperinflation;\n- -  A new online, global wellbeing centre hosting high quality resources supporting emotional wellbeing, physical wellbeing, nutritional wellbeing and financial wellbeing has been made available to all employees;\n- -  Renewed promotion of the Group's Global Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) service across all our Group locations. This programme provides a wide range of confidential services including budgeting and addressing stress to build financial confidence; and\n- -  Employee benefit and discount platforms are actively promoted where available.\n\nIn a period of significantly higher inflation, the Committee is aware that restraint should be exercised when reviewing Executive Director remuneration. Having considered the holistic actions and responses taken for our wider workforce, the Committee is satisfied that the executive remuneration outturns for 2022 and the implementation of our Remuneration Policy for the Executive and non-Executive Directors in 2023, are appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Group's Remuneration Policy is summarised in Section C on pages 149-155. This current Policy was approved by shareholders in 2021 and provides the framework for remuneration decisions made by the Committee until the next Policy review.\n\nThe Committee is confident that the Group's Remuneration Policy is aligned with shareholder interests, promotes long-term sustainable success and is in line with applicable best market practice. Furthermore, it ensures that Executive Director remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose, values and culture and can be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy and mid-term financial targets.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Policy has operated as intended for 2022 and the remuneration outturns are appropriate, however some minor changes have been made to the operation of the Policy for 2023 following a review of operation in 2022 in the context of the key focus areas for 2023.\n\nConsistent with our three-year review cycle, the Committee will undertake a full review of the Policy in 2023 to ensure it remains appropriate and continues to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the highest quality on an international basis. Ahead of bringing a new Policy to shareholders at the 2024 AGM, we will engage with a range of key stakeholders on any material changes proposed.\n\n## Kerry's Remuneration Principles\n\n## Delivery of Group Purpose, Values and Strategy\n\nThe Group's Executive Director short and long-term remuneration philosophy is to ensure that Executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose, values and culture, supports strategy and promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\n## Creating Sustainable, Long-Term Performance\n\nRemuneration includes performance related elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\n## Attract, Motivate and Retain Talent\n\nMarket-competitive total remuneration is structured to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the highest quality on an international basis.\n\n## Stakeholder Interests\n\nBy incorporating a high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration to short-term and long-term performance metrics with robust share ownership requirements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Pay For Performance\n\nThe Committee ensures alignment with shareholders' longterm interests by aligning remuneration metrics with the Group's business model and strategic objectives.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Outturn 2022\n\nIn determining the Executive Directors' remuneration outturns for the financial year, the Committee maintained a clear and rigorous focus on aligning pay with performance in the context of another challenging year, due to heightened levels of inflation and uncertain economic conditions globally.\n\nIn 2022, the Group delivered good overall growth with Group revenues reaching a record level of \u20ac8.8 billion, constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.3% and free cash flow generation of \u20ac640 million. We achieved strong progress in evolving the Group's portfolio aligned to our strategic priorities of Taste, Nutrition and Emerging Markets as well as advancing further along our Beyond the Horizon sustainability journey.\n\n## 2022 Short-Term Incentive Plan Outturn\n\nFor Executive Directors, the 2022 STIP was based on financial metrics aligned to the Group's strategy with 35% based on Volume Growth, 27% on EBITDA Margin Expansion and 18% on Cash Conversion. Performance against key Strategic Objectives formed the remaining 20% of the overall STIP weighting.\n\nThe calculated outturn on the STIP for 2022 was 78% of the maximum available opportunity. The outturn was driven by achieving maximum vesting level for the Volume Growth metric on the back of a year of record growth, on target or slightly above vesting levels for the Margin Expansion and Cash Conversion metrics, and strong performance against Strategic Objectives. The Committee reviewed the formulaic outturn of the quantitative metrics and is satisfied that the overall outturn is reflective of the Group's and the Executive Directors' very strong performance during the year, against the backdrop of the challenging macro-economic environment and the stretching nature of the targets set. In line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, onethird of the STIP payout will be deferred into shares/ options to be held for two years.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan 2020-2022 Outturn\n\nThe three-year performance period in respect of the 2020-2022 LTIP award ended on 31 December 2022. The 2020 LTIP award was subject to growth in Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS), Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) performance metrics with a weighting of 50%, 30% and 20% respectively.\n\nThe final outturn of the 2020-2022 LTIP award was 21.3% of maximum opportunity as outlined in further detail on page 164.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWhile we have seen a strong recovery in our EPS performance over the past two years, the COVID-19 impact on the 2020 EPS performance largely offset the EPS growth achieved for the remaining two years of the award, resulting in a low vesting level for this metric. This is the third year in which the impact of the pandemic in 2020 has had a very significant negative effect on the LTIP outturn. Our TSR performance was below median compared to our TSR peer group and has therefore not achieved the threshold level for vesting. ROACE performance was above threshold and vested accordingly.\n\nNo discretion will be applied to the formulaic vesting of the 2020 LTIP award for Executive Directors despite their strong performance over the performance period. However, consistent with the discretion previously exercised, we adjusted the formulaic vesting of the EPS metric of the 2020 LTIP for the Executive Directors' extended leadership teams. The vesting of the 2020 LTIP will be adjusted for approximately 400 leaders from 21.3% to 40%, in recognition of their sustained commitment, agility and performance against a very challenging backdrop.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Implementation 2023 Basic Salary\n\nIn reviewing the basic salaries for the Executive Directors, the Committee was mindful of the broader external environment, the strong performance of our Executive team, and in particular our wider workforce experience as outlined previously.\n\nFor 2023 the basic salaries of the Executive Directors will be increased by 3.2% (Ireland based) and 4% (US based). These increases are below the 2023 average increases available for the wider workforce population in Ireland (3.5%) and the US (4.5%), with higher increases available for lower-paid employees or where market adjustments are required.\n\n## Pension Alignment\n\nAs detailed on page 151, Executive Directors' pension contribution rates have been aligned to those of Kerry's wider workforce in Ireland with effect from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Incentive Plans\n\nWe have consistently ensured that there is very strong alignment between our short-term and long-term incentive metrics and the Group's business strategy and financial targets. During 2022, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the incentive plan metrics and weightings again to ensure full alignment with the Group's purpose, values, culture, strategy and midterm targets.\n\n## 2023 Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe STIP performance metrics, weightings and target calibrations were reviewed in 2022 and the Committee concluded that, while no changes are required to the metrics, the weighting attributable to the Cash Conversion metric should be increased to reflect the greater emphasis on cash generation management during 2023. Other metrics will be reweighted accordingly with Volume Growth retaining the highest weighting. Annual STIP maximum opportunity will remain unchanged for 2023.\n\n## 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe LTIP performance metrics, weightings and target calibrations were also reviewed in 2022. The Committee decided to adjust the target ranges for the EPS and ROACE metrics, given the current uncertain, volatile and inflationary economic environment, and to adjust the target range for the sustainability metrics as the Group moves another year closer to the targets included in the 2030 Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy. The target for the TSR metric remains unchanged and there are no changes to the weightings of the metrics or to the LTIP maximum opportunity levels. The Committee considers the revised targets similarly challenging to the targets set in prior years allowing for global economic conditions.\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\nKerry has a strong track record of demonstrating appropriate rigour and discipline when setting stretching targets. The Committee is satisfied that the targets set for the 2023 STIP and LTIP awards are appropriately stretching, particularly given the current uncertain economic environment, significant inflationary pressures, overall market growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required to support future growth ambitions.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fees for 2023\n\nFor 2023, no substantive increases are proposed and, in line with the Remuneration Policy, an annual increase will again be applied to the base fee paid to Directors in 2023. An increase of 3.2% will be applied to the base fee paid to the Chairman and non-Executive Directors. This increase is lower than the increase available to the wider workforce in Ireland. No increases will be applied to Committee membership fees, Committee chair fees or any other fees.",

        "page_content": "## Other Matters\n\n## All Employee Share Plan\n\nDuring 2022, a detailed review was undertaken to design Kerry's first global All Employee Share Plan which will provide employees globally with the opportunity to become shareholders and allow them to share in the success of the Group. The Committee and the Board believe that share ownership is a powerful and important way of creating an ownership culture and mindset and as such we will seek shareholder approval for the plan at the 2023 AGM. Subject to shareholder approval, implementation will commence on a phased basis from 2023 onwards.\n\n## Committee Refreshment\n\nFollowing Tom Moran's appointment to Chairman of the Board in April 2022, I was appointed to chair the Committee. Ms. Fiona Dawson was appointed to the Committee in February 2022, and she has brought with her a valuable new perspective.\n\n## Committee Performance\n\nAn external review of the Remuneration Committee's performance was undertaken by Independent Audit Limited during 2022 and the outcome of this review is that the Committee concluded that it is operating effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Committee has again faced difficult decisions in appropriately recognising the contributions of our leadership teams in very challenging circumstances. While the 2020 LTIP outturn for our Executive Directors is disappointing in the context of their sustained and focused leadership over the three-year performance period, the Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration outturn for 2022 is reflective of underlying business performance and the wider stakeholder experience. The Committee is also satisfied that the remuneration set for 2023 for the Executive Directors and our wider workforce is appropriate and reflective of the general economic environment.\n\nThe Committee continues to review the Group's Remuneration Policy to ensure that it remains aligned to shareholders' long-term interests and provides the right framework to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors in line with the pay for performance principle.\n\nAs in previous years, the Remuneration Report is being put to shareholders for an advisory vote. Last year 97% of our shareholders who voted, voted in favour of the Remuneration Report and I hope our shareholders continue to provide their support at this year's AGM.\n\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Remuneration Committee for their commitment and support during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmer Gilvarry\n\nChairperson of the Remuneration Committee",

Remuneration includes performancerelated elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\nA high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration is based on short-term and longterm performance-related incentive programmes. By incorporating these elements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders. When authorising remuneration outturns, the Committee exercises independent judgement and discretion, taking account of Group and individual performance as well as the shareholder experience, environmental, governance and social matters and wider workforce pay conditions to ensure that it is fair and appropriate for the role, experience of the individual, responsibilities and performance delivered.\n\n## Drivers of Shareholder Return\n\nAs outlined in the Strategic Report on page 35, Volume Growth and Margin Expansion are the main drivers of Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) which is the key performance metric for measuring growth. Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) is a key measure of how efficiently the Group employs its available capital. Cash Conversion is an important indicator of the cash the Group generates for reinvestment or for return to shareholders.\n\nThese are the main Group metrics which drive the Executive Director's Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) underpinned by the Group's Sustainability metrics. Together these metrics deliver Total Shareholder Return which aligns the interest of the Executive Directors with that of the shareholders. Our remuneration philosophy also supports our long-term approach by deferring a significant part of annual and long-term variable remuneration into share awards, which provides clear alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders, together with requiring Executive Directors to acquire and maintain significant shareholdings in the Group.\n\nIn line with best market practice, malus and clawback provisions apply to the Executive Director's STIP and LTIP awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderpinned by Sustainability Measures\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nKerry's current Remuneration Policy was submitted to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General meeting, one year earlier than required under the Shareholders Rights Directive as enacted in Ireland.\n\nAs an Irish incorporated Company Kerry Group plc is not obliged to comply with the UK legislation which requires UK companies to submit their remuneration policies to a binding shareholder vote every three years or earlier if changes are required prior to this.\n\nSimilarly, Kerry Group plc is not required to comply with the remuneration reporting regulation contained in the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 but follows the requirements as a matter of best practice unless they conflict with Irish or other legal requirements or there are other reasons where it is considered not practical to do so.\n\nIn setting remuneration levels, the Committee has regard to UK, USA and European companies which are comparable to the Group in terms of size, geographical spread and complexity of business, and operate in the food and beverage and other sectors. It also considers workforce remuneration and related policies and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.",

This is achieved by (i) the balanced use of both short-term and long-term incentive plans which  employ a blend of financial, non-financial and shareholder return targets (ii) the significant role played by  equity in our incentive plans together with shareholding requirements (iii) malus and clawback provisions and  (iv) the ability of the Committee to utilise discretion to adjust formulaic outturns to ensure outturns are aligned  to, and are reflective of, the underlying business performance of the Group. |\n| Predictability        | Executive Directors' remuneration is subject to individual participation caps, with our share-based plans  also subject to market standard dilution limits. The scenario charts on page 155 illustrate how the rewards  potentially receivable by our Executive Directors vary based on performance delivered and share price growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Proportionality       | There is a clear link between individual rewards, delivery of strategy and long-term performance. In addition,  the significant role played by STIP and LTIP/'at risk' pay, together with the structure of the Executive Directors'  service contracts, ensures that poor performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Alignment to  Culture | Kerry has a relentless focus on delivering for our shareholders and other stakeholders and this is fully aligned  with our Remuneration Policy in that employee personal success is directly linked to the success of the Group  through the short-term and long-term incentive plans and targets we operate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nThe Company is operating its remuneration arrangements in line with the approved Remuneration Policy, which came into effect in 2021 and will apply for up to three years. The Committee is comfortable that the Policy remains appropriate supporting the Group's strategy and that no changes are required prior to the triennial vote at the 2024 AGM.

They align with the Group's strategic objectives while also ensuring the longterm operational and financial stability of the Group. Targets are set at appropriately stretching levels to achieve threshold, target and maximum payout levels. Performance targets are based predominately on the financial metrics of Volume Growth, Margin Expansion and Cash Conversion (amounting to 80% of maximum opportunity).\n\nVolume Growth and Margin Expansion are key performance metrics as they are the main drivers of Adjusted EPS Growth. Cash Conversion is key to ensuring there are sufficient funds available for reinvestment or for return to shareholders.\n\nStrategic objectives (amounting to 20% of maximum opportunity) are relevant to each Executive Director's specific area of responsibility and are key in ensuring focus on the strategic and functional priorities of the business including relevant sustainability priorities.\n\nDue to their commercial sensitivity, the Committee is of the view that it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose the targets in advance of or during the relevant performance period. The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\n## LTIP\n\nThe performance targets under the LTIP are set to reflect the Group's longer-term growth objectives and at a level where maximum opportunity genuinely represents outperformance. The performance measures are currently based on Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR, ROACE and Sustainability metrics.\n\nAdjusted EPS Growth is a key performance metric encompassing all the components of growth important to the Group's stakeholders. EPS Growth is driven by the STIP metrics, Volume Growth and Margin Expansion. TSR is an important indicator of how successful the Group has been in terms of shareholder value creation. ROACE represents a good perspective on the Group's internal rate of return and financial added value for shareholders. ROACE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns. Sustainability metrics are core to maintaining our strategy and long-term sustainable performance and are reviewed at the time of each award.\n\n## How Remuneration Links with Strategy\n\n| Performance Measure   | Strategic Priority                                         | Incentive Scheme   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Volume growth         | Key driver of revenue growth                               | STIP               |\n| Margin expansion      | Key driver of profit growth                                | STIP               |\n| Cash conversion       | Cash generation for reinvestment or return to shareholders | STIP               |\n| Strategic objectives  | Development and execution of business strategies           | STIP               |\n| Adjusted EPS growth   | Delivery of the Group's long-term growth strategy          | LTIP               |\n| TSR                   | Delivery of shareholder value                              | LTIP               |\n| ROACE                 | Balance growth and return                                  | LTIP               |\n| Sustainability        | Core to our strategy and long-term sustainable performance | LTIP               |",

The Committee further has the discretion to recover incentives paid within a period of two years from vesting (clawback).\n\nThe key trigger events for the use of malus and clawback provisions include material misstatement of the Company's audited financial results, serious wrongdoing, payment made on the basis of erroneous data, gross misconduct, serious reputational damage and corporate failure.\n\nAny recalculation of the award shall be effected in such manner and subject to such procedures as the Group determines to be measured and appropriate, including repayment of any excess incentive or offset against any amounts due or potentially due to the participant under any vested or unvested incentive awards.\n\nThe Company retains the right to apply the malus and clawback provisions to former directors STIP and LTIP awards. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback provisions.\n\n## Committee Discretion\n\nThe Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic outturns under STIP and LTIP to ensure outturns are aligned to and are reflective of the underlying business performance of the Group.\n\nIn line with plan rules, the Committee may, at its discretion, amend or vary the performance metrics of the STIP and LTIP related incentives, the calculation methodology for those performance metrics and the composition of the TSR peer group when appropriate, in the interest of alignment and fairness.\n\n## Service Contracts\n\nThe CEO and Executive Directors have service contracts in place which can be terminated by either party giving 12 month's notice. In addition, all service contracts include pay in lieu of notice, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of up to 12 months post departure, (accompanied by such payments as are considered necessary or appropriate to sustain such provisions) in order to protect the Group's customer base, employees and intellectual property.\n\nNo ex-gratia severance payments are provided for in respect of the CEO or Executive Directors.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for Recruitment of New Executive Directors\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will determine the contractual terms for new Executive Directors, subject to appropriate professional advice to ensure that these reflect best practice and are subject to the limits specified in the Group's approved Policy as set out in this report.\n\nSalary levels for new Executive Directors will take into account the experience and calibre of the individual and his/her remuneration expectations. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years, subject to individual performance and development in the role.\n\nPension and benefits will be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation, travel or other expenses provided if necessary.\n\nThe structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with and subject to the limits set out in the Group's approved Policy detailed above. Different performance metrics may be set initially for STIP in the year an Executive Director joins the Group taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in the financial year that he/she joins the Board. Subject to the rules of the scheme, an LTIP award may be granted after joining the Group.\n\nIf it is necessary to buyout incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer) in the case of an external appointment, this would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited. The general policy is that payment should be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide reasonable compensation for remuneration being forfeited. The Group's policy is that the period of notice for new Executive Directors should not exceed 12 months and should include pay in lieu of notice, noncompete and non-solicitation provisions to protect the Group.\n\nThe Committee will ensure that any arrangements agreed will be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Payments for Loss of Office\n\nIn the event of a Director's departure, the Group's policy on termination is as follows:\n\n- -  the Group will pay any amounts it is required to make in accordance with or in settlement of a Director's statutory employment rights and in line with their employment agreement;\n- -  the Group will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is warranted in each individual case;\n- -  STIP and LTIP awards will be paid out in line with plan rules on exit (i.e. for good leavers as defined in the LTIP rules), with awards prorated to normal vesting date, subject to performance and a two year holding requirement and prorated to reflect the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed on the date of cessation; and\n- -  other payments, such as legal or other professional fees, repatriation or relocation costs and/or outplacement fees, may be paid if it is considered appropriate and at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nA Director's service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.\n\n## Change of Control\n\nOutstanding STIP and LTIP awards/options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to plan rules, including the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro-rating. The Committee may exercise its discretion to vary the level of vesting having regard to the circumstances and reasons for the events giving rise to the change of control.\n\n## Alignment with Workforce Pay and Policies\n\nThere is strong alignment between how we set pay for our Executive Directors and the wider workforce, as well as clear alignment in the mechanics of how we operate our pay review process and design our benefit and incentive plans. The key difference in remuneration structures is that, overall, the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay compared to other employees.\n\nAn update on wider workforce remuneration is tabled as a specific agenda item at every Remuneration Committee meeting to enable the Committee to consider the wider workforce experience when setting the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and making executive remuneration decisions.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Group's Executive Directors and senior management. Differences in quantum will depend on size of the role and responsibility, the location of the role and local market practice. Senior management are invited to participate in both the STIP and LTIP to incentivise performance through the achievement of short-term and long-term objectives and through the holding of shares in the Group.\n\nTo further strengthen the alignment between Executive Directors and wider workforce, we will be seeking shareholder approval for a new All Employee Share Plan at the 2023 AGM. During 2022, a detailed review was undertaken to design Kerry's first global All Employee Share Plan which will provide employees with the opportunity to become shareholders and allow them to share in the success of the Group. The Committee and the Board believe that share ownership is a powerful and important way of creating an ownership culture and mindset. Subject to shareholder approval implementation will commence on a phased basis from 2023 onwards.\n\n## Consultation with Employees\n\nOur approach to employee engagement is set out in detail on page 123 including the approach to understanding the views of our wider workforce. Dr. Karin Dorrepaal, a member of the Remuneration Committee, is our current designated Workforce Engagement Director, and she works closely with our Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) to provide the Committee with regular updates on engagement with, and feedback from, employees. When setting remuneration for Executive Directors the Committee takes into account the remuneration structures, policies and practices in the Group as a whole, the feedback from employee engagement activities and the information provided by our external advisors. The Group has a number of different channels for engagement including an annual engagement survey, targeted pulse checks with specific employee groups, regular town halls, a dedicated digital employee communication platform and our Speak Up facility. The Committee continually reviews and enhances these channels to enable the Committee to engage more effectively with the workforce to explain the alignment between Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy and the pay policy and practices applicable to the wider workforce.\n\n## Consultation with Shareholders\n\nThe Committee considers the guidelines issued by the major institutional shareholders and the bodies representing them, the guidelines and feedback provided by proxy advisors and direct feedback from shareholders, when completing its annual and triennial review of the Group's Executive Remuneration policies and practices.\n\nThe Committee is committed to continued consultation with shareholders regarding its Remuneration Policy.",

In determining the fees, which are set within the limits approved by shareholders, consideration is given to both the complexity of the Group and the level of fees paid to non-Executive Directors in comparable companies. Fees are reviewed on an annual basis and the base fee is usually increased in line with the increase available to the wider workforce in Ireland. A detailed benchmark review is carried out on a three-year basis and any recommendations are presented to the Executive Directors for approval. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Group's incentive plans, pension arrangements or other elements of remuneration provided to the Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses (and any personal tax that may be due on those expenses). Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding in the Company.\n\n## Illustration of Remuneration Policy\n\nThe following diagrams show the minimum, target, maximum and maximum +50% share appreciation, composition balance between the fixed and variable remuneration components for each Executive Director, effective for 2023. For illustration purposes, target performance for LTIP is reflected as 50% of maximum opportunity. The inner most circle represents the minimum potential scenario for remuneration, with the 2nd circle representing target, the 3rd circle representing maximum potential and the outer circle representing maximum potential plus 50% increase in the LTIP share value.\n\n## Edmond Scanlon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Marguerite Larkin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gerry Behan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe charts above exclude the effect of any Company share price appreciation except in the 'maximum +50%' scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Section D: Remuneration Policy Implementation\n\n## Part I: Remuneration Policy Implementation 2023\n\nThis part of the report sets out how the proposed Remuneration Policy as described on pages 149-150 will operate in 2023.\n\n## Basic Salary and Benefits\n\nThe salaries of the Executive Directors effective for the year commencing on 1 March 2023, together with the comparative figures, are as follows:\n\n| Directors         | 2023 \u20ac'000*   | 2022 \u20ac'000*   | % Increase   |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Edmond Scanlon    | 1,289         | 1,249         | 3.2%         |\n| Marguerite Larkin | 797           | 773           | 3.2%         |\n|                   | $'000*        | $'000*        | % Increase   |\n| Gerry Behan       | 1,060         | 1,019         | 4.0%         |\n\nFor 2023 the basic salaries of the Executive Directors will be increased by 3.2% (Ireland based) and 4% (US based). These increases are below the 2023 average increases available for the wider workforce population in Ireland (3.5%) and the US (4.5%), with higher increases available for lower-paid employees or where market adjustments are required.\n\nBenefits relate primarily to the use of a company car/ car allowance. Any travel arrangements or travel costs required for business purposes will also be met by the Group, on a net of tax basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Group CEO participates in the general employee Irish defined contribution scheme and the CFO receives a taxable cash allowance based on a percentage of basic salary, in lieu of pension. The CEO Taste & Nutrition participates in a US-defined contribution scheme and a US-defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nThe pension contribution rate for Executive Directors has been aligned to that of Kerry's wider workforce in Ireland (currently a rate of 10%) with effect from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP)\n\nA review of the STIP metrics was completed in 2022 to ensure that they remain appropriate, are linked to strategy, consistent with best practice and that the targets are appropriately calibrated. The Committee concluded that, while no changes are required to the metrics for 2023, the weighting attributable to the Cash Conversion metric should be increased to 25% (previously 18%) to reflect the increased focus on cash generation management.\n\nThe weighting attributable to the Volume Growth and the Margin Expansion metrics will be adjusted to 30% (previously 35%) and 25% (previously 27%) respectively. Strategic Objectives will continue to be weighted at 20%. All metrics continue to support the Group's long-term sustainable growth and forward-looking strategy as well as attracting, motivating and retaining Executives of the highest quality internationally.\n\nThe maximum STIP opportunity remains the same as 2022, 200% of salary for the CEO and 175% of salary for the CFO and CEO Taste & Nutrition.\n\n## 2023 STIP - Performance Metrics and Weightings for Executive Directors\n\n|                      | % of award   | % of award   |\n|----------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group Metrics        | Target       | Max          |\n| Volume growth        | 15%          | 30%          |\n| Margin expansion     | 12.5%        | 25%          |\n| Cash conversion      | 12.5%        | 25%          |\n| Strategic objectives | 10%          | 20%          |\n| Total                | 50%          | 100%         |\n\nThe Committee is of the view that a 50% of maximum award payout for on target performance is appropriate, taking into account the level of stretch in the targets set. Due to the commercial sensitivity of the financial metrics and strategic objectives, the Committee is of the view that it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose the targets in advance of, or during, the relevant performance period. The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.",

The Committee decided to adjust the target ranges for the EPS and ROACE metrics, given the current uncertain, volatile and inflationary economic environment, and to adjust the target range for the sustainability metrics as the Group moves another year closer to the targets included in the 2030 Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy. The target for the TSR metric remains unchanged as do the weightings for all metrics.\n\n| LTIP Award Year                    | 2023              | 2023                          |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Performance Metrics                | Threshold Maximum |                               |\n| EPS (40% weighting)  1             |                   |                               |\n| Kerry's EPS growth per annum       | 4%                | 10%                           |\n| % of award which vests             | 25%               | 100%                          |\n| ROACE (15% weighting)              |                   |                               |\n| ROACE achieved                     | 9%                | 12%                           |\n| % of award which vests             | 25%               | 100%                          |\n| Relative TSR (25% weighting)       |                   |                               |\n| Position of Kerry in peer group  2 |                   | Median Above 75th  percentile |\n| % of award which vests             | 25%               | 100%                          |\n| Sustainability (20% weighting)  3  |                   |                               |\n| Nutrition Reach Goal               | 1.2bn             | 1.4bn                         |\n| Carbon Reduction                   | 48%               | 50%                           |\n| Food Waste Reduction               | 35%               | 40%                           |\n| % of award which vests             | 25%               | 100%                          |\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the target ranges above are appropriately stretching particularly given the current macro-economic environment, challenging trading conditions, overall market growth rates, the level of capital expenditure required to support future growth ambitions and performance achieved against the previous targets set (see pages 34-35).\n\nEach Executive Director will be awarded their maximum LTIP opportunity in 2023 as follows, CEO 300% of basic salary, CFO 250% of basic salary and CEO Taste & Nutrition 250% of basic salary. These maximum opportunities are unchanged versus the previous year.\n\nSee Group Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on pages 38-39 for more information on the link between the performance metrics used for incentive purposes and the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Remuneration Review\n\nFor 2023, no substantial increases are proposed and in line with the Remuneration Policy, an annual increase will again be applied to the base fee paid to nonExecutive Directors. An increase of 3.2% will be applied to the base fee paid to the Chairman and non-Executive Directors. This increase is lower than the increase available to the wider workforce in Ireland.\n\nThe following increases will be applied effective 1 March 2023.\n\n| Fee Type 1                        |   2023 Fees \u20ac'000 |   2022 Fees \u20ac'000 |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Chairman's fee                    |               407 |               395 |\n| Non-Executive Director   Base fee |                89 |                86 |",

Marguerite Larkin received a taxable cash payment in lieu of pension benefits. The employer pension contribution in 2022 for both Edmond Scanlon and Marguerite Larkin was 18% of their basic salaries. The pension figure for Gerry Behan includes both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefits.\n- Note 4: The 2022 STIP amount represents two thirds delivered in cash with one third delivered by way of shares/share options which are deferred for two years.\n- Note 5: The share price used to calculate the value of the LTIP is the average share price for the three months up to the end of the year being reported. The negative share price movement versus that applicable at the date the conditional awards were granted has decreased the valuation of the awards (that will vest in 2023) over the three years by (\u20ac91k) for Edmond Scanlon, (\u20ac51k) for Marguerite Larkin and by (\u20ac64k) for Gerry Behan. The LTIP included in this table was awarded in 2020.\n- Note 6: The table shows the Executive Director's pay in the currency of payment to ensure clarity in reflecting the year-on-year payment comparisons.\n- Note 7: The total remuneration for Executive Directors was \u20ac8,993k (2021: \u20ac8,595k) using a US dollar exchange rate of 1.05 (2021: 1.19).",

The targets also took account of planned investments (both capital and operational) that the Group is making to enable revenue growth and margin expansion, as well as necessary working capital investments to mitigate ongoing global supply chain challenges.\n\n## Strategic Objectives - 20% weighting\n\nThe Executive Directors are also measured against strategic objectives. Performance against these objectives is determined by the Committee by reference to key targets agreed with the Executives at the start of the year. The table below sets out the performance outturn for the strategic element of the STIP.\n\n| Metric             | 4.

        "page_content": "## Discretion\n\nThe Committee concluded that there was no requirement to exercise discretion as the 2022 STIP outturns reflected the underlying performance of the business, the broader stakeholder experience and the strong performance of the Executive Directors against strategic objectives.\n\n## Final Outturn for 2022\n\nThe targets for the Executive Directors, which were set by the Remuneration Committee, were challenging and stretching in the context of the uncertain and volatile economic and inflationary environment. For 2022 a payout of 78% of maximum opportunity was achieved by each Director.\n\nUnder the Policy, one third of the STIP is awarded by way of shares or options which are issued following the end of the two-year deferral period.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\n## LTIP Approved in 2021 (2021 LTIP)\n\nA new LTIP plan was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. The first conditional awards under this plan were made to Executive Directors in 2021. Subject to performance metrics being met over a three-year performance period, the first awards under this plan will potentially vest in March 2024, 100% of which will be subject to a two year deferral period.\n\n## LTIP Approved in 2013 (LTIP 2013)\n\nThe terms and conditions of the plan were approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM. The Remuneration Committee approves the terms, conditions and allocation of conditional awards under the Group's LTIP to Executive Directors and senior management. Under this plan, Executive Directors and senior management are invited to participate in conditional awards over shares or share options in the Company.\n\nSubject to performance metrics being met over a three-year performance period, the LTIP award will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 50% of the award is delivered at the vesting date with the remaining 50% of the award being delivered following a two-year deferral period. This provides for a combined performance period and deferral period of five years for half of the award that vests.\n\nThe first conditional awards under this scheme were made to Executive Directors in 2013. The maximum award that can be made to an individual Executive Director under the LTIP over a 12-month period is equivalent to 180%-200% of basic salary for that period.\n\nAn award may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date. The market price of the shares on the date of each award outlined above is disclosed in note 28 to the financial statements.\n\nThe proportion of each conditional award which vests will depend on the Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR and ROACE performance of the Group during the relevant three-year performance period.\n\n## 2020 LTIP Awards\n\nSet out below is the performance against targets for the 2020 LTIP award where the three-year performance period ended on 31 December 2022 and the award vests in 2023.\n\n## EPS Performance Test\n\n50% of the award vests according to the Group's average adjusted EPS growth ('EPS metric') over the performance period. This measurement is determined by reference to the Group's adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis in each of the three financial years in the performance period in accordance with the vesting schedule outlined in the following table:\n\n|           | Average  Adjusted EPS  Growth   | Percentage  of the Award  Which Vests   |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Threshold | 6%                              | 25%                                     |\n| Target    | 10%                             | 50%                                     |\n| Maximum   | 12%                             | 100%                                    |\n\nBelow 6% none of the award vests. Vesting between target points is on a straight line basis.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly adverse impact on the EPS metric in 2020 (-9.4%), which largely offset the strong adjusted EPS growth (pre dilutive effect of disposals) achieved in 2021 (+15.3%) and 2022 (+14.9%) respectively. Accordingly, the outturn of the EPS performance test, calculated on a constant currency basis over the three-year period, is an annual average adjusted EPS growth of 6.9% which results in an award outturn of 15.3% out of a possible maximum of 50%. When calculating the outturn for this metric, the adjusted EPS growth % used for both 2021 and 2022 excludes the dilutive effect which the significant business disposals (Consumer Foods' Meats and Meals business and the Russian business completed during those years), had on the reported result for the adjusted EPS growth metric as the disposals were not anticipated when the targets were originally set three years ago. The reported adjusted EPS growth for 2021 at 12.1% and 2022 at 7.3% recognised a dilution of 3.2% and 7.6% respectively.\n\n## Vesting Level for EPS Metric\n\nThe outturn of the EPS performance test is an average adjusted EPS growth of 6.9% which results in an award outcome of 15.3% out of a possible maximum of 50%.",

ROACE represents a good perspective on the Group's internal rate of return and financial added value for shareholders. ROACE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns. This measurement is determined by reference to the ROACE in each of the three financial years included in the performance period:\n\n|           | Return on Average Capital Employed   | Percentage of the Award Which Vests   |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Threshold | 10%                                  | 25%                                   |\n| Target    | 12%                                  | 50%                                   |\n| Maximum   | 14%                                  | 100%                                  |\n\nBelow 10% none of the award vests. Vesting between target points is on a straight line basis.\n\n## Vesting Level for ROACE Metric\n\nThe outturn of the measurement of the ROACE metric in relation to the 2020 award is a ROACE of 10.4% resulting in an award outturn of 6% out of a maximum of 20%.",

In line with best practice guidelines, the Company ensures that the level of share awards granted under all share schemes does not exceed 10% of the Group's share capital over a rolling tenyear period, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period in respect of discretionary schemes. The dilution resulting from all vested share awards/share options for the ten-year period to 31 December 2022 is 1.1%. This level of dilution is well below the maximum dilution level recommended for executive share-based incentive plans.\n\nThe potential future dilution level from unvested share awards/share options as a result of these schemes is a further 0.8%.\n\nThe UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 require certain UK incorporated companies to publish the ratio of CEO remuneration to UK staff pay. Although not a requirement for Irish incorporated companies, the ratio of the CEO's total remuneration to that of the median Irish employee is disclosed in the table below, in line with the Group's commitment to ensure that its remuneration policies, practices and reporting reflect best corporate governance practices.\n\nIn providing the CEO ratio we have used Method C as set out in the regulations but have applied the principles of Method A.\n\nTable 12: CEO Ratio\n\n|                                                                         | 2022  \u20ac'000*   | 2021  \u20ac'000*   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer's: Total remuneration                           | \u20ac3,899         | \u20ac3,855         |\n| Median Irish employee: Total remuneration                               | \u20ac50            | \u20ac43            |\n| Median Irish employee: Salary only                                      | \u20ac47            | \u20ac41            |\n| Median pay ratio - Total remuneration                                   | 77x            | 89x            |\n| Median pay ratio - excluding all variable short and long-term incentive | 31x            | 37 x           |\n\nThe Committee believes that our senior executives should have a significant proportion of their pay directly linked to Group performance in order to drive alignment with shareholders. A significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is therefore delivered through the Group's short-term and long-term incentive plans where awards are linked to Group performance and share price movements over time. This means that ratios will depend significantly on short-term and long-term incentive outturns and may fluctuate from year to year as a result.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio based on total remuneration for 2022 is lower than 2021 which is primarily due to a change in the profile of our median Irish employee following the divestment of our Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business during 2021. The equivalent total remuneration figure for the CEO is largely unchanged in 2022 as compared to 2021. The combined performance outturn under both the short-term and long-term incentive plans is broadly similar yearon-year.\n\nAs the median Irish employee does not participate in the Group's short-term or long-term performance-related incentive plans, the Committee has provided the median pay ratio excluding these variable pay elements again in 2022 and this ratio has also decreased year-on-year.",

These are crossreferenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB\n\nAs explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion, the Consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) ('ISAs (Ireland)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (Ireland) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Ireland, which includes IAASA's Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by IAASA's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.",

We selected these components due to their size or characteristics and to ensure appropriate audit coverage. An audit of the complete financial information of 23 components was performed. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were also performed at a further 13 components. We also performed audit work at each of the principal shared service centres.\n- -   The reporting components where an audit of the complete financial information was performed accounted for in excess of 80% of Consolidated revenues and in excess of 80% of Consolidated profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- -   Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment assessment (Group).\n- -  Income taxes (Group).\n- -  Recoverability of Investments in Subsidiaries (Company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.",

We determined this to be a key audit matter  given the scale of the assets and because the  determination of whether an impairment charge  for goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets  was necessary involves significant judgement in  estimating the future results of the business and  determining the appropriate discount rate to use. | We assessed the appropriateness of the Group's forecast  growth rate assumptions used to calculate terminal values  at year five, by comparing them to independent sources (for  example OECD statistics) of projected growth rates for each  region. We used our in-house valuation experts in assessing  management's calculation of the discount rate. Our experts  developed a range of discount rates (adjusted to reflect risks  associated with each group of CGUs) using observable inputs  from independent external sources. We also considered management's sensitivity analysis which  included the potential impact of climate related events and  performed our own sensitivity analysis on the impact of  changes in key assumptions on the impairment assessment,  for example the cash flows, discount rates and the rates of  growth assumed by management.  Based on our procedures we determined that management's  conclusion that there was no goodwill or indefinite life  intangible assets impairment was reasonable.

The carrying value of the investment in subsidiaries needs to be considered for impairment where any indicators arise that suggest that the carrying value of these investments would not be recoverable.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter as investments in subsidiaries are the principal assets held by the Company.\n\n## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, including those performed at the Group's shared service centres and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Group is structured along two operating segments: Taste & Nutrition and Dairy Ireland. The majority of the Group's components are supported by one of the Group's principal shared service centres in Malaysia, Mexico and the United States.\n\nWe determined that an audit of the complete financial information (a 'full scope' audit) should be performed at 23 components due to their size or risk characteristics and to ensure appropriate coverage. These 23 components included components that control central Group functions such as Treasury and Employee Benefits. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were also performed at a further 13 components. The reporting components where an audit of the complete financial information was performed accounted for in excess of 80% of Consolidated revenues and in excess of 80% of Consolidated profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n\nThe Group team performed the audit of certain central functions. Component auditors within PwC ROI and from other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, performed the audit on all other in scope components and the required supporting audit work at each of the Group's principal shared service centres.\n\nThe Group team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement the Group team needed to have to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe considered management's assessment as to whether there were any indicators of impairment at year end taking into account the market capitalisation of the Company and the procedures performed on the future cash flow forecasts prepared for the purposes of the impairment assessment as described in the 'Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment assessment' key audit matter above. Based on our procedures we determined that management's conclusion that there are no impairment indicators was reasonable.\n\nIn the current year, the Group team resumed site visits which are designed so that senior team members visit the full scope audit locations regularly on a rotational basis. During 2022, the Group team visited component locations in Ireland, the USA, Mexico and Malaysia. In addition to site visits, senior members of the Group engagement team used video conferencing to facilitate our oversight of the component auditor work and had video meetings and discussions with certain management and component audit teams in locations which we did not visit in the current year.\n\nThe meetings, both physical and virtual, with our component teams confirmed their audit approach. The meetings also involved discussing and understanding the significant audit risk areas and obtaining updates on local laws and regulations and other relevant matters. In addition to the meetings noted above, the Group team interacted regularly with the component teams during all stages of the audit. We received a detailed memorandum of examination on work performed and relevant findings in addition to an audit report that supplemented our understanding of the individual components. The Group engagement team also reviewed certain audit working papers in component audit files. Post audit conference calls were held with all full scope audit teams to discuss their audit findings.\n\nThis, together with audit procedures performed by the Group team gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. These procedures included, amongst others, procedures over IT systems, treasury, post-retirement benefits, the consolidation process and key audit matters including uncertain tax positions and impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.",

Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to \u20ac31.5 million (Group audit) and \u20ac7.9 million (Company audit).\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac1.9 million (Group audit) (2021: \u20ac1.7 million) and \u20ac532,000 (Company audit) (2021: \u20ac525,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- -   evaluating management's going concern assessment (being the period of 12 months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue) and challenging the key assumptions. In evaluating these forecasts, we considered the Group's historic performance and its past record of achieving strategic objectives. Additionally we have considered management's assessment of the likely impact which the current macroeconomic environment and climate\n\nrelated risks may have on financial performance and liquidity for a period of 12 months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue;\n\n- -   testing the mathematical integrity of the forecasts and the models and reconciling these to board approved budgets;\n- -   considering whether the assumptions underlying the base case were consistent with related assumptions used in other areas of the entity's business activities, for example in testing for non-financial asset impairment;\n- -   performing our own independent sensitivity analysis to assess further appropriate downside scenarios; and\n- -   considering the Group's available liquidity, financing and maturity profile to assess liquidity through the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nWe are required to report if the directors' statement relating to going concern in accordance with Rule 6.1.82 (3) (a) of the Listing Rules for Euronext Dublin and Rule 9.8.6R(3) of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the Corporate Governance Statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- -   The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- -   The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- -   The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- -   The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- -   The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of environmental regulations, food safety and hygiene regulations and health and safety regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as tax legislation and the Irish Companies Act 2014. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results and potential management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:\n\n- -   Discussions with the Audit Committee, management, legal and internal audit including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;\n- -   Reading the meeting minutes of the Board of Directors, Audit, Risk Oversight, Governance, Nomination and Sustainability and Remuneration Committees;\n- -   Considered the results of reporting from component teams relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and procedures performed to address assessed fraud risk;\n- -   Assessment of matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing service referred to as the 'Speak Up Programme' and the results of the Ethics and Compliance Team's investigation in so far as they related to the financial statements;\n- -   Inspection of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements;\n- -   Evaluating whether there was evidence of management bias that represents a risk of material misstatement due to fraud;\n- -   Identifying and testing journal entries, including manual revenue entries, unusual account combinations and consolidation journals based on our risk assessment; and\n- -   Designing audit procedures to incorporate elements of unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of audit procedures performed.",

We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the IAASA website at:\n\nhttps://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6458b-9b8f-a98202dc9c3a/Description\\_of\\_auditors\\_ responsibilities\\_for\\_audit.pdf\n\nThis description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with section 391 of the Companies Act 2014 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2014 opinions on other matters\n\n- -   We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our audit.\n- -   In our opinion the accounting records of the Company were sufficient to permit the Company financial statements to be readily and properly audited.\n- -   The Company Balance Sheet is in agreement with the accounting records.\n\n## Other exception reporting\n\n## Directors' remuneration and transactions\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2014 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, the disclosures of directors' remuneration and transactions specified by sections 305 to 312 of that Act have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\nWe are required by the Listing Rules to review the six specified elements of disclosures in the report to shareholders by the Board on directors' remuneration. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Prior financial year Non Financial Statement\n\nWe are required to report if the Company has not provided the information required by Regulation 5(2) to 5(7) of the European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017 in respect of the prior financial year. We have nothing to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Prior financial year Remuneration Report\n\nWe are required to report if the Company has not provided the information required by Section 1110N of the Companies Act 2014 in respect of the prior financial year. We have nothing to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe were appointed by the members on 28 April 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 7 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enda McDonagh\n\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers Chartered Accountants and Statutory Audit Firm Dublin\n\n15 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Financial Statements\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 1.   Statement of accounting policies\n\n## General information\n\nKerry Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The registered number is 111471 and registered office address is Prince's Street, Tralee, Co. Kerry, V92 EH11, Ireland. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Business Reviews and note 36 'Group entities'.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Kerry Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act, 2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements include the information in the remuneration report that is described as being an integral part of the financial statements. Both the Parent Company and Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union ('EU') which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). The Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS adopted by the EU.\n\nThe Parent Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting policies consistent with the accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements by the Group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) and financial asset investments which are held at fair value. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements contained herein are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company, Kerry Group plc. The functional currencies of the Group's main subsidiaries are euro, US dollar and sterling.\n\nThe Group has determined that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (net) and amortisation (EBITDA) is a key performance metric used by the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Executive Directors). From 1 January 2022 EBITDA replaces trading profit as one of the key measures utilised in assessing the performance of the Group. EBITDA represents profit before finance income and costs, income taxes, depreciation (net of capital grant amortisation), intangible asset amortisation, nontrading items and share of joint ventures' results after\n\ntaxation and is a widely used measure in the evaluation of profitability and performance. This has been reflected in the presentation of the Group's Consolidated Income Statement and note 2 'Analysis of results', as permitted under IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements'.\n\nThe Group has updated its 'Basis of consolidation' in respect of a new non-controlling interests policy.\n\nIn the 2022 consolidated financial statements, the Group has re-presented corresponding 2021 balances to align with current year presentation in the Consolidated Income Statement, note 2 'Analysis of results', note 3 'Operating profit', note 4 'Total staff numbers and costs', note 12 'Intangible assets', note 24 'Financial instruments' and note 28 'Share-based payments'.\n\nCertain income statement headings and other financial measures included in the consolidated financial statements are not defined by IFRS. The Group makes this distinction to enhance the understanding of the financial performance of the business as outlined in the Supplementary Information section pages 255-259.\n\nThe consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The Directors have considered the Group's business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance and position of the Group, including liquidity and access to financing as outlined in note 24 and the potential impacts of climate, geopolitical and macroeconomic environment related risks on profitability. There are no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\nThe Directors report that they have satisfied themselves that the Group is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In forming this view, the Directors have reviewed the Group's forecast for a period not less than 12 months, the medium term plan, and have taken into account the cash flow implications of the plans, including proposed capital expenditure, and compared these with the Group's committed borrowing facilities and projected gearing ratios.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), all of which prepare financial statements up to 31 December. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power over the investee, has exposure or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date the Company gained control until the date the Company ceased to control the subsidiary. All inter-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\nBasis of consolidation (continued) Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Group and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, distinguished from the Group's shareholders' equity. Where not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interests are recognised at the non-controlling interest's share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. On acquisition of the investment in joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying value of the investment.\n\nThe Group's share of its joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in 'Share of joint ventures' results after taxation' in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves until the date on which joint control ceases. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment, less any impairment in value. Where indicators of impairment arise, the carrying amount of the joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent that they do not provide evidence of impairment. The accounting policies of joint ventures are amended where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment at Group level.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue represents the value of the consideration received or receivable, for both segments from third party customers. Revenue is recorded at invoice value, net of discounts, allowances, volume and promotional rebates and excludes VAT. Revenue is recognised when control of the products has transferred, which is usually upon shipment, or in line with terms agreed with individual customers. Revenue is recorded when there is no unfulfilled obligation on the part of the Group. An estimate is made on the basis of historical sales returns and is recorded to allocate these returns to the same period as the original revenue is recorded. Rebates and discounts are provided for based on agreements or contracts with customers, agreed promotional arrangements and accumulated experience using the expected value method. Any unutilised accrual is released after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made is highly improbable.\n\nThe Group disaggregates revenue by End Use Market (EUM) and primary geographic market. An EUM is defined as the market in which the end consumer or customer of Kerry's product operates. The economic factors within the EUMs of Food, Beverage and Pharma & other which affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar.\n\n## Segmental analysis\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management structure of the Group and the internal financial information provided to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Executive Directors) who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources, monitoring and assessing the performance of each segment. EBITDA as reported internally by segment is the key measure utilised in assessing the performance of operating segments within the Group. Other Corporate activities, such as the cost of corporate stewardship, are reported along with the elimination of inter-group activities under the heading 'Group Eliminations and Unallocated'. Non-trading items, net finance costs and income taxes are managed on a centralised basis and therefore, these items are not allocated between operating segments and are not reported per segment in note 2.\n\nThe Group has determined it has two reportable segments: Taste & Nutrition and Dairy Ireland. The Taste & Nutrition segment is a world leading provider of taste and nutrition solutions for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical markets. Utilising a broad range of ingredient solutions to innovate with our customers to create great tasting products, with improved nutrition and functionality, while ensuring a better impact for the planet. Kerry is driven to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition through solving our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated solutions. The Taste & Nutrition segment supplies industries across Europe, Americas and APMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa). The Dairy Ireland segment is a leading Irish provider of value-add dairy ingredients and consumer products. Our dairy ingredients product portfolio includes functional proteins and nutritional bases, while our dairy consumer brands can be found in chilled cabinets in retailers across Ireland and the UK.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price and other directly attributable costs. Freehold land is stated at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation on the remaining property, plant and equipment is calculated by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement at the following annual rates:\n\n| Buildings                      | 2% - 5%   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|\n| Plant, machinery and equipment | 7% - 25%  |\n| Motor vehicles                 | 20%       |\n\nThe charge in respect of periodic depreciation is calculated after establishing an estimate of the asset's useful economic life and the expected residual value at the end of its useful economic life. Increasing/(decreasing) an asset's expected useful economic life or its residual value would result in a (decreased)/increased depreciation charge to the Consolidated Income Statement as well as an increase/ (decrease) in the carrying value of the asset.\n\nThe useful economic lives of Group assets are determined by management at the time the assets are acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness. These useful economic lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their useful economic life, such as changes in technology or the location of the asset and its climate related risk. Historically, changes in useful economic lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to the Group's depreciation charge.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (continued)\n\nAssets in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and other directly attributable costs. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, on the same basis as other property assets.\n\n## Leasing\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which consists of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group in setting up/entering into the lease, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease and any payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentive received).\n\nThe Group depreciates right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful economic life or the end of the lease term. The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed or variable payments (based on an index or rate), amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nSubsequent to the initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for the interest applied and it is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or contract modifications. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or in the Consolidated Income Statement if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to nil.\n\nThe Group has elected to record short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets as defined in IFRS 16 as an operating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group has also elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated nonlease components as a single lease component further increasing the lease liability.\n\n## Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nAssets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met if, at the financial year end, the sale is highly probable, the assets and related liabilities are available for immediate sale in their present condition, management is committed to the sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.\n\nAssets and related liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous Irish/ UK GAAP amounts subject to impairment testing. Goodwill written off to reserves under Irish/UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\n\nAt the date control is achieved, goodwill is allocated for the purpose of impairment testing to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) provided they represent the lowest level at which management monitor goodwill for impairment purposes. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for indications of impairment at least annually and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, where identified. Impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill (not previously written off to reserves) is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Brand related intangibles\n\nBrand related intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at their fair value at the date control is achieved. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortised and are tested for impairment at least annually. Indefinite life intangible assets are those for which there is no foreseeable limit to their expected useful economic life. In arriving at the conclusion that these brand related intangibles have an indefinite useful economic life, management considers the nature and type of the intangible asset, the absence of any legal or other limits on the assets' use, the fact the business and products have a track record of stability, the high barriers to market entry and the Group's commitment to continue to invest for the long-term to extend the period over which the intangible asset is expected to continue to provide economic benefits. The classification of intangible assets as indefinite is reviewed annually. The future expectation of potential market disruption due to changing consumer preferences or changes in supply chain of raw materials linked to sustainability and climate change were assessed as part of\n\nthis review and were deemed to have no material impact.\n\nFinite life brand related intangible assets are amortised over the period of their expected useful economic lives, which predominantly range from 2 to 20 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. The useful economic life used to amortise finite intangible assets relates to the future performance of the assets acquired and management's estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Historically, changes in useful economic lives have not resulted in material changes to the Group's amortisation charge.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software separately acquired, including computer software which is not an integral part of an item of computer hardware, is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price and other directly attributable costs.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\nIntangible assets (continued)\n\nComputer software (continued)\n\nCosts relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria outlined as follows are met:\n\n- -an asset can be separately identified;\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;\n- -it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity;\n- -the cost of the asset can be measured reliably; and\n- -the Group controls the asset.\n\nComputer software is amortised over its expected useful economic life, which ranges from 3 to 7 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. Amortisation commences when the assets are ready for use.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment or when indications exist that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, these assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) using a reasonable and consistent basis. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Value in use is determined as the discounted future cash flows of the CGU. The key assumptions during the financial year for the value in use calculations are discount rates, cash flows and growth rates.\n\nWhen an impairment loss (other than on goodwill) subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not exceeding its carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is reviewed by assessing the asset's value in use when compared to its carrying value.\n\nThe carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and all other expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated at the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price of inventory on hand less all further costs to completion and all costs expected to be incurred in distribution and selling. Write-downs of inventories are primarily recognised under 'Raw materials and consumables' in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement except when they relate to items charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity. In this instance the income taxes are also charged or credited to other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity.\n\nThe current tax charge is calculated as the amount payable based on taxable profit and the tax rates applying to those profits in the financial year together with adjustments relating to prior years. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group is subject to uncertainties, including tax audits, in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group accounts for uncertain tax positions in line with IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments'. The Group considers each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If the Group concludes that it is not probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment the Group reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rate. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment using an expected value approach or a most likely approach depending on which method the Group expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The unit of account for recognition purposes is the income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group does not provide separately for uncertain tax positions. When the final tax outcome for these items is different from amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax in the period in which such a determination is made, as well as the Group's cash position.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated based on the temporary differences arising between the tax base of the asset or liability and its carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred taxes are recognised on all temporary differences in existence at the balance sheet date except for:\n\n- -temporary differences which arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect accounting or taxable profit or loss, or on the initial recognition of goodwill for which a tax deduction is not available; and\n- -temporary differences which arise on investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe recognition of a deferred tax asset is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Income taxes (continued)\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net basis. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Retirement benefits obligation\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due and any contributions outstanding at the financial year end are included as an accrual in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nActuarial valuations for accounting purposes are carried out at each balance sheet date in relation to defined benefit schemes, using the projected unit credit method, to determine the schemes' liabilities and the related cost of providing benefits. Scheme assets are accounted for at fair value using bid prices.\n\nCurrent service cost is recognised as it arises within staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement. Net interest which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is recognised in interest costs in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a scheme are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the curtailment or settlement occurs. Re-measurement of retirement benefits obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe defined benefit liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of any scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are also recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are limited to the present value of available refunds from, and reductions in future contributions to, the scheme.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions can be distinguished from other types of liability by considering the events that give rise to the obligation and the degree of uncertainty as to the amount or timing of the liability. These are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when:\n\n- -the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;\n- -it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- -a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, after taking account of the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nThe outcome depends on future events which are by their nature uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome, management bases its assessment on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Provisions are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nCertain items, by virtue of their nature and amount, are disclosed separately in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. These items relate to events or circumstances that are not related to normal trading activities and are labelled collectively as 'non-trading items'.\n\nNon-trading items predominantly include gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, disposal of assets (noncurrent assets and assets classified as held for sale), costs in preparation of disposal of assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, costs relating to material restructuring or material transformation plans and material transaction, integration and restructuring costs associated with acquisitions. Non-trading items are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Research and development expenditure\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is assessed and capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset only if it meets all of the following criteria:\n\n- -it is technically feasible to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -it is intended to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -adequate resources are available to complete the asset for sale or use; and\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nCapitalised development costs are amortised over their expected economic lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, product development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred. Accordingly, the Group has not capitalised product development expenditure to date.\n\n## Grants\n\nGrants of a capital nature are accounted for as deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are released to the Consolidated Income Statement at the same rates as the related assets are depreciated. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement to offset the matching expenditure.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are accounted for when they are approved, through the retained earnings reserve. Dividends proposed do not meet the definition of a liability until such time as they have been approved. Dividends are disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has granted share-based payments to Executive Directors and senior executives under a long-term incentive plan and to Executive Directors under a shortterm incentive plan.\n\nThe equity-settled share-based awards granted under these plans are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The cost of the award is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period of the awards based on the probable number of awards that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to shareholders' equity.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Share-based payments (continued)\n\nFor the purposes of the long-term incentive plan, the fair value of the award is measured using the Monte Carlo Pricing Model. For the short-term incentive plan, the fair value of the expense equates directly to the cash value of the portion of the short-term incentive plan that will be settled by way of shares/share options.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Share-based payments are disclosed in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising from either the retranslation of the resulting monetary assets or liabilities at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date or from the settlement of the balance at a different rate are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when they occur.\n\nOn consolidation, the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into euro at the average exchange rate. If this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, a weighted average rate is used. The balance sheets of such subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Resulting exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries are taken directly to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries and are translated at the closing rate.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign currency subsidiary, the cumulative translation difference for that foreign subsidiary is recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets, which take a substantial period of time to construct, are added to the cost of the asset during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used for the acquisition of businesses. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate fair value of the consideration given. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' are recognised at their fair value at the date the Group assumes control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Group's previously held investment in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are not recognised at their fair value at the date control was achieved as they are accounted for using other applicable IFRSs. These include deferred tax assets/liabilities and also any assets related to employee benefit arrangements.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is still in progress. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period of one year from the date control is achieved when additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances which would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement measured at fair value at the date control is achieved. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.\n\nAny fair value adjustments in relation to acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations (2004)'.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries held by the Parent Company are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Investments in joint ventures\n\nInvestments in joint ventures held by the Group are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except for those classified as fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis, where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe of the market concerned.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, only if the Group holds an enforceable legal right of set off for such amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In all other instances they are presented gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- -those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income ('OCI') or through profit or loss); and\n- -those to be measured at amortised cost.",

    {
        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Financial instruments (continued)\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').\n\n## Debt instruments:\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- -Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n- -FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. The Group have no debt instruments measured at FVOCI.\n- -FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss ('FVPL'). In addition, assets that are irrevocably designated as FVPL at origination to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch are also measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Equity instruments:\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Consolidated Income Statement following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the Group's right to receive payments is established.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets measured at FVPL (Rabbi Trust assets) are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.\n\n## Trade and other receivables:\n\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components. The amount of consideration that is unconditional approximates to fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost consists of cash at bank and in hand, bank overdrafts held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less from the date of placement. Cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits are shown under current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the heading 'Cash at bank and in hand'. Bank overdrafts are shown within 'Borrowings and overdrafts' in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows. The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nOther non-derivative financial liabilities consist primarily of trade and other payables and borrowings. Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost, which approximates to their fair value given the short-term nature of these liabilities. Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing.\n\nDebt instruments are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost, except for hedged debt. To the extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the carrying value of the debt instrument is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the hedged risk, with changes arising recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The fair value of the hedged item is primarily determined using the discounted cash flow basis.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVPL arise when the financial liabilities are either derivative liabilities held for trading or they are designated upon initial recognition as FVPL.\n\nThe Group classifies as held for trading certain derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group does not have any other financial liabilities classified as held for trading.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Further detail is provided in note 19.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are carried at fair value. The Group's activities expose it to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in relation to international trading and long-term debt. The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. When cross currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the change in the foreign currency basis spreads element of the contract, that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other reserves under the cost of hedging reserve.",

Where such prices are not available a discounted cash flow analysis is used based on the applicable yield curve adjusted for counterparty risk for the duration and currency of the instrument, which are observable:\n\n- -foreign exchange forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates to match the maturities of these contracts; and\n- -interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves adjusted for counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWhere derivatives, including forward foreign exchange contracts and floating to fixed interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps are used, they are primarily treated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is recognised in OCI and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period when the hedged item is recognised through profit or loss. All effective amounts are directly offset against movements in the underlying hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in OCI and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period the hedged item is recognised through profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. When the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs and results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in the hedge reserve, within OCI are reclassified through profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is impacting the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such as inventory. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied to foreign exchange forward contracts which are expected to offset the changes in fair value of expected future cash flows. In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for management to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nWhere fixed to floating interest rate swaps are used, they are treated as fair value hedges when the qualifying conditions are met. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nHedge accounting is derecognised when the hedging relationship ceases to exist. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised over the remaining maturity of the hedged item through the Consolidated Income Statement from that date.\n\n## Trading derivatives\n\nCertain derivatives which comply with the Group's financial risk management policies are not accounted for using hedge accounting. This arises where the derivatives; (a) provide a hedge against foreign currency borrowings without having to apply hedge accounting; or (b) where management have decided not to apply hedge accounting. In these cases the instrument is reported independently at fair value with any changes recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. In all other instances, cash flow or fair value hedge accounting is applied.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimations, assumptions and judgements that affect the reported profits, assets and liabilities.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nIn particular, information about significant areas of estimation and judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are described below and in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets (Estimation) Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment of intangible assets (other than on goodwill) should be recorded requires comparison of the value in use for the relevant groups of cash generating units (CGUs) to the net assets attributable to those CGUs. The value in use calculation is based on an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and these are discounted to net present value using an appropriate discount rate. The tests are dependent on management's estimates, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows, the expected long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and terminal values. Such estimates are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions. As forecasting future cash flows is dependent upon the Group successfully leveraging its base of intangible assets over the long-term, estimates are required in relation to future cash flows which will support the asset value. These estimates may depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets (Estimation) (continued)\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the Group was considered and has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. The impact of climate change has also been considered, specifically on the timing and the extent of costs and cash outflows and is based on a critical evaluation of the facts currently available to the Group taking into account factors such as, existing technology, currently enacted laws and regulations and knowledge and expertise within the Group. Changes to legislation and government policy relating to climate change have been considered in the assessment of the impact of climate change. The measurement of the impact of climate change is based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of conditions that will exist in the foreseeable future. The potential impact of climate related events considered as part of the sensitivity analysis had no impact on our conclusions. Details of the assumptions used and key sources of estimation involved are outlined in note 12 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group continues to monitor its assessment of the economic environment particularly due to accelerating inflationary cost pressures, disruption of global supply chains and the challenges presented in China with localised restrictions. The long-term outlook for our businesses currently remains positive, supports our CGU valuations and no impairment was identified as a result of the impairment testing review carried out. There is significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value and the likelihood of impairment is not considered likely to occur in the next financial year.\n\n## Business combinations (Estimation)\n\nWhen acquiring a business, the Group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value, the determination of which requires a significant degree of estimation.\n\nAcquisitions may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Estimation is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets. For intangible assets acquired, the Group bases valuations on expected future cash flows taking into consideration the impact of climate related risk and COVID-19 where applicable. This method employs a discounted cash flow analysis using the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated from the purchased intangible asset using risk adjusted discount rates, revenue forecasts and estimated customer attrition as appropriate. The period of expected cash flows is based on the expected useful economic life of the intangible asset acquired.\n\nDepending on the nature of the assets and liabilities acquired, determined provisional fair values may possibly be adjusted within the measurement period as allowed by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nThe useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined by management at the time the assets are acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness, including assessment as finite or indefinite. These useful economic lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, such as changes in technology, the location of the asset and its climate related risk.\n\nIntangible assets are disclosed in note 12 and business combinations in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-trading items (Judgement)\n\nThe Group considers certain items, by virtue of their nature and amount, are disclosed separately in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. These items relate to events or circumstances that are not related to normal trading activities and are labelled collectively as 'non-trading items'. Determining which transactions are to be disclosed separately is often a subjective matter. Circumstances that the Group believes would give rise to non-trading items for separate disclosure are outlined in the accounting policy on non-trading items. For clarity, separate disclosure is made of all items in one column on the face of the Group Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Income tax charge and income/deferred tax assets and liabilities (Estimation and Judgement)\n\nSignificant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required in determining the income tax charge as the Group operates in many jurisdictions and the tax treatment of many items is uncertain with tax legislation being open to different interpretation. Furthermore, the Group can also be subject to uncertainties, including tax audits in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. The Group considers these uncertain tax positions in the recognition of its income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. In line with its accounting policy, the Group bases its assessment on the probability of a tax authority accepting its general treatment having regard to all information available on the tax matter and when it is not probable reflects the uncertainty in income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. When applying its accounting policy at the year end the Group generally considered each uncertain tax treatment separately and reflected the effect of the uncertainty in the income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities using an expected value approach as this better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Such estimates are determined based on management judgement, interpretation of the relevant tax laws, correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and external tax advisors and past practices of the tax authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax matters is different from the amounts that were recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax charge in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIncome taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.",

The economic factors within the EUMs of Food, Beverage and Pharma & other and within the primary geographic markets which affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar.\n\n## Analysis by EUM\n\n|                  | Taste & Nutrition 2022 \u20ac'm   | Dairy Ireland 2022 \u20ac'm   | Total 2022 \u20ac'm   | Taste & Nutrition 2021 \u20ac'm   | Dairy Ireland 2021 \u20ac'm   | Total 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Food             | 4,925.2                      | 1,286.2                  | 6,211.4          | 3,837.5                      | 1,587.4                  | 5,424.9          |\n| Beverage         | 1,959.1                      | 98.7                     | 2,057.8          | 1,515.2                      | 73.9                     | 1,589.1          |\n| Pharma & other   | 502.7                        | -                        | 502.7            | 336.6                        | -                        | 336.6            |\n| External revenue | 7,387.0                      | 1,384.9                  | 8,771.9          | 5,689.3                      | 1,661.3                  | 7,350.6          |\n\n## Analysis by primary geographic market\n\nDisaggregation of revenue from external customers is analysed by geographical split:\n\n|                     | Taste & Nutrition 2022 \u20ac'm   | Dairy Ireland 2022 \u20ac'm   | Total 2022 \u20ac'm   | Taste & Nutrition 2021 \u20ac'm   | Dairy Ireland 2021 \u20ac'm   | Total 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Republic of Ireland | 82.2                         | 458.2                    | 540.4            | 64.1                         | 394.6                    | 458.7            |\n| Rest of Europe      | 1,459.8                      | 768.8                    | 2,228.6          | 1,168.7                      | 1,089.6                  | 2,258.3          |\n| Americas            | 4,172.2                      | 84.0                     | 4,256.2          | 3,137.5                      | 97.7                     | 3,235.2          |\n| APMEA               | 1,672.8                      | 73.9                     | 1,746.7          | 1,319.0                      | 79.4                     | 1,398.4          |\n| External revenue    | 7,387.0                      | 1,384.9                  | 8,771.9          | 5,689.3                      | 1,661.3                  | 7,350.6          |\n\n## Information about geographical areas\n\n|                                          | Europe 2022 \u20ac'm   | Americas 2022 \u20ac'm   | APMEA 2022 \u20ac'm   | Total 2022 \u20ac'm   | Europe 2021 \u20ac'm   | Americas 2021 \u20ac'm   | APMEA 2021 \u20ac'm   | Total 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Assets by location                       | 5,357.9           | 5,486.3             | 1,439.2          | 12,283.4         | 5,205.1           | 4,959.2             | 1,231.1          | 11,395.4         |\n| Property, plant and equipment  additions | 55.8              | 147.4               | 53.6             | 256.8            | 83.7              | 152.5               | 56.6             | 292.8            |\n| Intangible asset additions               | 12.1              | 0.1                 | -                | 12.2             | 33.1              | 1.0                 | -                | 34.1             |\n\nThe revenue and non-current assets (as defined in IFRS 8 'Operating Segments') attributable to the country of domicile and all foreign countries of operation, for which revenue exceeds 10% of total external Group revenue, are set out below.\n\nKerry Group plc is domiciled in the Republic of Ireland and the revenues from external customers in the Republic of Ireland were \u20ac540.4m (2021: \u20ac458.7m).

Non-trading items (continued)\n\n## (i) (Loss)/profit on disposal of businesses and assets (continued)\n\n## (Loss)/profit of disposal of businesses (continued)\n\nOn 22 July 2022, the Group reached agreement to divest 100% of the share capital of Kerry Limited Liability Company, its subsidiary in Russia, to local management. These businesses were not deemed to be discontinued operations and goodwill was allocated to these disposed businesses using an appropriate allocation methodology aligned with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'. During the year the Group also disposed of a small cereal operation in North America. The loss on disposal of these businesses was \u20ac63.0m (2021: \u20acnil). A tax credit of \u20ac4.3m (2021: a tax credit of \u20acnil) arose on the disposal of these businesses.\n\nIn 2021 the Group disposed of its Meats and Meals business operating in Ireland and the UK from the Consumer Foods (now Dairy Ireland) division and during the year also disposed of a small operation in Taste & Nutrition Europe for a consideration of \u20ac813.6m resulting in a gain of \u20ac230.9m. A tax credit of \u20ac0.5m arose on the disposal of these businesses.\n\n## Profit/(loss) on disposal of assets\n\nDuring the year, the Group disposed of property, plant and equipment (note 11) primarily in North America and APMEA for a combined consideration of \u20ac51.7m resulting in a gain of \u20ac6.2m . In 2021, the Group disposed of property, plant and equipment and computer software in North America, Europe and APMEA for a combined consideration of \u20ac19.4m resulting in a loss of \u20ac2.6m. A tax charge of \u20ac1.9m (2021: a tax credit of \u20acnil) arose on the disposal of assets.\n\nIn 2022, certain assets classified as held for sale (note 18) based in the USA and APMEA were impaired to their fair value less costs to sell by \u20ac5.6m (2021: \u20ac48.6m), consisting of \u20ac1.2m (2021: \u20ac17.1m) of property, plant and equipment impairment, \u20ac2.7m (2021: \u20acnil) of goodwill impairment, \u20ac1.7m (2021: \u20acnil) of brand related intangibles impairment and \u20acnil (2021: \u20ac31.5m) of estimated costs to sell including marketing, legal, site rectification, environmental and other related expenses necessary to complete the disposals. These assets held for sale are expected to sell in 2023. The related tax credit was \u20ac0.5m (2021: \u20ac12.2m).\n\nIn 2022, there was a specific impairment charge of \u20ac0.3m and \u20ac0.4m (2021: \u20acnil) in relation to goodwill and brand related intangibles respectively recorded in intangible assets (note 12).\n\n## (ii) Global Business Services expansion\n\nIn 2020, the Group commenced a programme to evolve, migrate and expand its Global Business Services model to better enable the business and support further growth. For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group incurred costs of \u20ac13.6m (2021: \u20ac33.3m) reflecting relocation of resources, advisory fees, redundancies and the streamlining of operations. The associated tax credit was \u20ac3.0m (2021: \u20ac1.2m).\n\n## (iii) Acquisition integration costs\n\nThese costs of \u20ac20.3m (2021: \u20ac54.9m) reflect the relocation of resources, the restructuring of operations in order to integrate the acquired businesses into the existing Kerry operating model and external costs associated with deal preparation, integration planning and due diligence. A tax credit of \u20ac4.5m (2021: \u20ac12.4m) arose due to tax deductions available on acquisition related costs.\n\n## (iv) Accelerate Operational Excellence\n\nThese costs of \u20ac49.2m (2021: nil) predominantly reflect consultancy fees, project management costs and costs of streamlining operations incurred in the period relating to our Accelerate Operational Excellence transformation programme, which will run until 2024. This material transformation project deploying next generation manufacturing processes, including advanced process controls, is combined with building capabilities within the Group to enhance continuous improvement in manufacturing processes which will deliver step change manufacturing excellence across the organisation. This project will also focus on supply chain excellence, optimising the Group's warehousing and distribution network. A tax credit of \u20ac11.6m (2021: \u20acnil) arose due to tax deductions available on accelerated operational excellence costs.\n\n## (v) Tax on inter-group transfer\n\nDuring 2021, a net tax credit of \u20ac16.6m arose as a result of the transfer of intangible assets between two wholly owned subsidiaries based in two different tax jurisdictions.\n\n## 6.

Factors that may affect the Group's future tax charge include the effects of restructuring, acquisitions and disposals, changes in tax legislation and rates and the use of brought forward losses. In 2021, political agreement was reached by the OECD Inclusive Framework on a two-pillar approach to international tax reform, which aims to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation and globalisation of the economy. In addition, the EU Directive on Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax was approved in December 2022. In the absence of any finalised or substantively enacted legislation, the Group continues to monitor developments as they may apply to the Group.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangibles are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. These assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount of each of the four CGUs is determined on value in use calculations. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition, rather than where the assets are owned.\n\nCash flow forecasts employed for the value in use calculations are for a five year period approved by management and a terminal value which is applied to the year five cash flows. The terminal value reflects the discounted value of the cash flows beyond year five which is based on the weighted average long-term growth rates for each CGU.\n\nNo impairment was recognised in 2022 or 2021 as a result of the impairment testing which identified significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value. In 2022, there was a specific impairment charge of \u20ac3.0m and \u20ac2.1m (2021: \u20acnil) in relation to goodwill and brand related intangibles respectively recorded in nontrading items (note 5) in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nA summary of the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU, is as follows:\n\n|                   | Goodwill 2022 \u20ac'm   | Goodwill 2021 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2022 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 634.7               | 563.1               | 168.2                                   | 193.9                                   |\n| Americas          | 2,157.1             | 2,150.1             | 1,450.8                                 | 1,356.4                                 |\n| APMEA             | 279.5               | 263.5               | 46.9                                    | 47.9                                    |\n| Dairy Ireland     |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 139.4               | 144.6               | 23.7                                    | 23.7                                    |\n|                   | 3,210.7             | 3,121.3             | 1,689.6                                 | 1,621.9                                 |\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nForecasts are generally derived from a combination of internal and external factors based on historical experience and take account of expected growth in the relevant region. The key assumptions for calculating value in use calculations are those relating to the discount rate, growth rate and cash flows.

The Irish dairy processing activities, previously reported in Taste & Nutrition, have been combined with the remaining dairy activities of the Consumer Foods business and this segment is named Dairy Ireland. Included within the Dairy Ireland 31 December 2021 comparatives are the results of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business which was disposed by the Group on 27 September 2021.\n\nManagement estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates consistent with the Group's weighted average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGUs. A higher discount rate is applied to higher risk markets, while a lower rate is applied to more stable markets.\n\nLong-term growth rates are based on external market data, are broadly in line with long-term industry growth rates and are conservative in nature. Generally, lower growth rates are used in mature markets while higher growth rates are used in emerging markets.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing (continued)\n\nThe assumptions used by management in estimating cash flows for each CGU include future profitability and capital expenditure requirements. The cash flows included in the value in use calculations are generally determined based on historical performance, management's past experience, management's expectation of future trends affecting the industry and other developments and initiatives in the business including the Group's strategic plans. Management also considered the impact of accelerating inflationary cost pressures, disruption of global supply chains and the challenges presented in China with localised restrictions on the Group which has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. Capital expenditure requirements to maintain the CGUs performance and profitability are based on the Group's strategic plans, excluding future development activity, and broadly assume that historic investment patterns will be maintained.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis has been performed across the four CGUs. If the discount rate was 1% higher than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2022 or 2021. Further, a 5% increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment charge in 2022 or 2021 as there is headroom in the discounted cash flows. If the estimated growth rate was 1% lower than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2022 or 2021. If the estimated cash flows were 5% lower than management's estimates, again there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2022 or 2021. Management believes that no reasonable change, in normal circumstances, in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount. The potential impact of climate related events and the estimated capital expenditure required to achieve the Group's sustainability objectives in reducing carbon emissions and achieving the ambition to become net zero before 2050 was also considered as part of the sensitivity analysis and had no impact on our conclusions.\n\n## 13.

The assets of these trusts primarily consist of equities, bonds and cash which are restricted for use. These assets are fair valued through profit or loss at each financial year end using quoted market prices. The corresponding liabilities are recognised within other non-current liabilities (note 22).",

The Group does not have any unrecognised losses which have an expiry date.\n\nDeferred tax has not been recognised in respect of withholding taxes and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax liabilities which have not been recognised in respect of these temporary differences are not material as the Group can rely on the availability of participation exemptions and tax credits in the context of the Group's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nAn increase of 1% in the tax rates at which deferred tax is calculated would increase the net deferred tax balance of the Group by \u20ac17.2m (2021: \u20ac16.7m).",

They are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAs announced on 11 January 2023, the Group has entered into exclusive negotiations prior to the year ended 31 December 2022, to sell the trade and assets of its Sweet Ingredients Portfolio in the Taste & Nutrition segment, for a consideration of \u20ac500m comprising an initial cash consideration of \u20ac375m plus a \u20ac125m interest bearing vendor loan note. The disposal proceeds are expected to substantially exceed the carrying amount of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of this business as held for sale. The potential sale is subject to relevant regulatory approvals, employee consultation and routine closing adjustments. The associated assets and liabilities have consequently been presented separately as assets held for sale in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. There will be no material impact recognised in other comprehensive income relating to this transaction.\n\nDuring the year, the Group also reached agreement to sell a non-core business and its related assets in the APMEA Taste & Nutrition segment. The assets of these businesses have been impaired to their fair value less costs to sell by \u20ac2.7m (2021: \u20acnil) of goodwill impairment and by \u20ac1.7m (2021: \u20acnil) of brand related intangibles impairment following their transfer to assets held for sale. The fair value less costs to sell of these assets are based on offers received for this business.\n\nThese businesses were not deemed to be discontinued operations and goodwill was allocated to these businesses using an appropriate allocation methodology aligned with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'. Estimated costs to sell including marketing, legal, site rectification, environmental and other related expenses necessary to complete the disposals incurred to date of \u20ac7.6m (2021: \u20ac31.5m). These assets held for sale are expected to sell in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn 2022, assets classified as held for sale of property, plant and equipment based in the USA in the Taste & Nutrition segment, were impaired to their fair value less costs to sell by \u20ac1.2m (2021: \u20ac17.1m) following their transfer to assets held for sale. The fair value less costs to sell of these assets are based on offers received for these assets.\n\nIn 2021, the Group held property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale in the Taste & Nutrition segment in North America and in the Dairy Ireland segment in the UK.",

The fair value of these receivables approximates their carrying value as these are short-term in nature; hence, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales and the corresponding historical credit loss experience. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors, including the GDP of the countries in which the Group sells its goods and services, that affect the ability of customers to settle receivables.\n\nBefore accepting any new customer, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer's credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. These credit limits are reviewed regularly throughout the financial year. The Group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade receivables.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk or transaction currency risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers. Further disclosures on currency risk are provided in note 24 to the financial statements.",

Trade and other receivables (continued)\n\nThe Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable:\n\n- -When there is a breach of financial covenants by the debtor;\n- -Information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full.\n\nThe Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example when a debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n## 20.

Analysis of financial instruments by category (continued)\n\nAll Group borrowings and overdrafts and interest rate swaps are guaranteed by Kerry Group plc. No assets of the Group have been pledged to secure these items.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group's debt portfolio included:\n\n- -US$750m of Senior Notes issued in 2013 maturing in 2023 (2023 Senior Notes), of which US$250m were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to euro;\n- -\u20ac750m of Senior Notes issued in 2015 and \u20ac200m issued in April 2020 as a tap onto the original issuance (2025 Senior Notes). \u20ac175m of the issuance in 2015 were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to US dollar;\n- -\u20ac750m of Senior Notes issued in 2019 (2029 Senior Notes). No interest rate derivatives were entered into for this issuance; and\n- -\u20ac750m of sustainability-linked bond notes issued in 2021 (2031 SLB Senior Notes) and no interest rate derivatives were entered into for this issuance.\n\nThe adjustment to Senior Notes classified under fair value through profit or loss of \u20ac12.5m of an asset (2021: liability \u20ac10.9m) represents the part adjustment to the carrying value of debt from applying fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk. This amount is primarily offset by the fair value adjustment on the corresponding hedge items being the underlying cross currency interest rate swaps.\n\n|                                          | Notes      | Financial  Assets/ (Liabilities)  at Amortised  Cost 2021 \u20ac'm   | Assets/ (Liabilities)  at Fair Value   through Profit  or Loss 2021 \u20ac'm   | Derivatives   Designated   as Hedging   Instruments 2021 \u20ac'm   | Assets/ (Liabilities) at  FVOCI 2021 \u20ac'm   | Total 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Group:                                   |            |                                                                 |                                                                           |                                                                |                                            |                  |\n| Financial asset investments              | 13         | -

Financial instruments\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe financing structure of the Group is managed in order to optimise shareholder value while allowing the Group to take advantage of opportunities that might arise to grow the business. The Group targets acquisition and investment opportunities that are value enhancing and the Group's policy is to fund these transactions from cash flow or borrowings while maintaining its strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt related financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, as represented in the table below:\n\n|                                                                          | Notes   | 2022   \u20ac'm   | 2021   \u20ac'm   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Issued capital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent |         | 6,221.9      | 5,601.2      |\n| Net debt - pre lease liabilities                                         | 23      | 2,148.2      | 2,049.9      |\n| Lease liabilities                                                        | 20/22   | 69.2         | 74.2         |\n| Deferred payments on acquisition of businesses                           | 20/22   | 27.0         | 15.0         |\n|                                                                          |         | 8,466.3      | 7,740.3      |\n\nIn November 2022 Moody's upgraded the credit rating of the Group to Baa1. There were no notable debt financing events in 2022.\n\nIn 2021 the Group undertook four notable debt financing events, the first three of which were completed in June:\n\n- -the Group entered into a dedicated bridge facility for US$1,000m for the acquisition of Niacet. This facility was drawn on the closure of the acquisition in late Q3 2021 and was repaid and cancelled in early Q4 2021, with repayment funded predominantly out of the proceeds from the sale of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business;\n- -the Group exercised the second of the two 'plus one' extension options on its \u20ac1,100m revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date of this facility for the full \u20ac1,100m to June 2026. As part of this process the Group amended and restated the facility agreement to allow for IBOR replacement language. This amendment to immediately adopt SONIA for GBP loans and to allow for switch language for US Dollars at a future date has no commercial impact on the Group. In keeping with the Group's commitment to sustainability, the facility incorporates a price adjustment mechanism which is linked to the Group meeting or exceeding its carbon, water and food waste reduction targets;\n- -the Group repaid US$200m of outstanding private placement notes ahead of the scheduled maturity date, (Tranche C US$125m and Tranche D US$75m of the 2010 Senior Notes). At the time of issuance the US$200m of private placement notes were swapped from US dollar fixed rate to euro floating rate using cross currency interest rate swaps which were closed out at the time of the repayment. The net cash outflow was funded from existing cash resources of the Group. Following repayment of the US$200m of private placement notes, the Group has no borrowings that carry financial covenants; and\n- -in December 2021 the Group issued \u20ac750m 10-year euro sustainability-linked bond notes (2031 SLB Senior Notes). The issuance is listed on the Euronext Dublin - Global Exchange Market. The proceeds of the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of indebtedness and the funding of acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. The SLB Senior Notes embed key 'Beyond the Horizon' sustainability commitments into our financing.\n\nAll Senior Notes issued by the Group are rated by S&P (BBB+) and Moody's (Baa1).\n\nNet debt is subject to seasonal fluctuations that can be up to 25% above year end debt levels, before allowance for acquisition activity undertaken during the financial year.\n\nCapital is managed by setting net debt to earnings before finance income and costs, income taxes, depreciation (net), intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (EBITDA) targets while allowing flexibility to accommodate significant acquisition opportunities. Any expected variation from these targets should be reversible in a period of time that retains our strong investment grade credit rating, otherwise consideration would be given to issuing additional equity in the Group.\n\n|                      |   2022   Times |   2021   Times |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Net debt: EBITDA     |            1.8 |            2   |\n| EBITDA: Net interest |           18.1 |           14.9 |\n\nThe Net debt: EBITDA and EBITDA: Net interest ratios disclosed are calculated using an adjusted EBITDA, adjusted finance costs (net of finance income) and an adjusted net debt value to adjust for the impact of non-trading items, acquisitions net of disposals and deferred payments in relation to acquisitions.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Group has a clearly defined Financial Risk Management Programme, which is approved by the Board of Directors and is subject to regular monitoring by the Finance Committee and Group Internal Audit. The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which manages the principal financial risks of the Group and Company.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are:\n\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk;\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate risk;\n- -to ensure that the Group has sufficient credit facilities available to fund the Group and manage liquidity risk; and\n- -to ensure that counterparty credit risk is monitored and managed.\n\nResidual exposures not managed commercially are hedged using approved financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's policies and procedures. The Group does not engage in speculative trading.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are further discussed across the following categories:\n\n- (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management - key foreign exchange exposure of the Group and the disclosures on forward foreign exchange contracts.\n- (ii) Interest rate risk management - key interest rate exposures of the Group and the disclosures on interest rate derivatives.\n- (iii) Liquidity risk management - key banking facilities available to the Group and the maturity profile of the Group's debt.\n- (iv) Credit risk management - details in relation to the management of credit risk within the Group.\n- (v) Price risk management - key price risk exposures of the Group.\n\n## (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk on trading activities conducted by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Group policy is to manage foreign currency exposures commercially and through netting of exposures wherever possible. Any residual exposures arising on foreign exchange transactions are hedged in accordance with Group policy using approved financial instruments, which consist primarily of spot and forward exchange contracts and currency swaps.\n\nAs at 31 December, the Group had an exposure to a US dollar asset of \u20ac6.8m (2021: \u20ac13.1m liability) and a sterling asset of \u20ac21.7m (2021: \u20ac36.5m). Based on these net positions, as at 31 December 2022, a weakening of 5% of the US dollar and sterling against all other key operational currencies, and holding all other items constant, would have impacted the profit after taxation of the Group for the financial year by a decrease of \u20ac1.2m (2021: \u20ac1.0m).\n\nThe Group's gain or loss on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries is taken directly to the translation reserve. As at 31 December 2022 a 5% strengthening of the euro against the US dollar and sterling, holding all other items constant, would have resulted in an additional translation reserve loss of \u20ac35.1m (2021: \u20ac25.9m) and \u20ac30.2m (2021: \u20ac23.2m), respectively.\n\n## (i.i) Forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to international trading, primarily sales in US dollar and sterling out of the Eurozone and sales and purchases in US dollar in APMEA. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures. All such exposures are highly probable. Derivative financial instruments are held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value.\n\nThe following table details the portfolio of forward foreign exchange contracts* at the balance sheet date:\n\n|                                       | 2022 \u20ac'm Asset   | 2022 \u20ac'm Liability   | 2022 \u20ac'm Total   | 2021 \u20ac'm Asset   | 2021 \u20ac'm Liability   | 2021 \u20ac'm Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Designated in a hedging relationship: |                  |                      |                  |                  |                      |                  |\n| - current  1                          | 22.5             | (16.8)               | 5.7              | 15.2             | (40.1)               | (24.9)           |\n| - non-current  2                      | 0.3              | (0.4)                | (0.1)            | 0.2              | (0.5)                | (0.3)            |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts    | 22.8             | (17.2)               | 5.6              | 15.4             | (40.6)               | (25.2)           |",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n(i) Foreign exchange rate risk management (continued)\n\n(i.i) Forward foreign exchange contracts (continued)\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months.\n\nThe Group adopted the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. The Group enters into hedge relationships when there is an economic relationship between the underlying highly probable forecasted transactions (hedged item) and the forward foreign exchange contracts (hedged instruments). As the critical terms match for the prospective assessment of effectiveness, a qualitative assessment is performed.

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n## (ii) Interest rate risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group holds borrowings on both a fixed and floating basis. This exposure to interest rate risk is managed by optimising the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by using interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge these exposures, in accordance with Group policy as approved by the Board of Directors. The Group reviews the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings on an ongoing basis and adjusts where necessary to comply with Group policy. Derivative financial instruments are held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value.\n\n## (ii.i) Interest rate profile of financial liabilities excluding related derivatives fair value\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the table below including the impact of cross currency swaps (CCS) on the currency profile of net debt (including cash at bank and lease liabilities):\n\nFloating\n\n|                     | Total   Pre CCS \u20ac'm   | Impact   of CCS \u20ac'm   | Total   after CCS \u20ac'm   | Rate Net   Debt \u20ac'm   | Fixed Rate Debt \u20ac'm   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Euro                | (2,166.6)             | (59.1)                | (2,225.7)               | 283.4                 | (2,509.1)             |\n| Sterling            | 59.1                  | -                     | 59.1                    | 59.1                  | -                     |\n| US Dollar           | (318.4)               | 59.1                  | (259.3)                 | (25.2)                | (234.1)               |\n| Others              | 180.5                 | -                     | 180.5                   | 180.5                 | -                     |\n| At 31 December 2022 | (2,245.4)             | -                     | (2,245.4)               | 497.8                 | (2,743.2)             |\n| Euro                | (1,831.1)             | (45.9)                | (1,877.0)               | 618.9                 | (2,495.9)             |\n| Sterling            | 74.5                  | -                     | 74.5                    | 74.5                  | -                     |\n| US Dollar           | (513.5)               | 45.9                  | (467.6)                 | (246.7)               | (220.9)               |\n| Others              | 122.3                 | -                     | 122.3                   | 122.3                 | -                     |\n| At 31 December 2021 | (2,147.8)             | -                     | (2,147.8)               | 569.0                 | (2,716.8)             |\n\nThe currency profile of debt highlights the impact of the US$250m (2021: US$250m) of cross currency swaps entered into at the time of issuance of Senior Notes. For the 2013 Senior Notes, US$250m were swapped from US dollar fixed to euro fixed and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The retranslation of the foreign currency debt of US$250m (2021: US$250m) to the balance sheet rate resulted in a foreign currency loss of \u20ac38.8m (2021: \u20ac25.5m) which is directly offset by a gain of \u20ac38.8m (2021: \u20ac25.5m) on the application of hedge accounting on the cross currency swaps.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds \u20ac950m of 2025 Senior Notes of which \u20ac750m were issued in 2015 and \u20ac200m were issued in 2020. \u20ac175m of the 2025 Senior Notes from 2015 were swapped, using cross currency swaps, from euro fixed to US dollar floating and are accounted for as fair value hedges of the related debt. The fair value of the related derivative includes a liability of \u20ac7.5m (2021: \u20ac2.9m asset) for movement in exchange rates since the date of execution which is directly offset by a gain of \u20ac7.5m (2021: \u20ac2.9m loss) on the application of hedge accounting on the cross currency swaps.\n\nThe floating rate financial liabilities are at rates which fluctuate mainly based upon LIBOR or EURIBOR and comprise of bank borrowings and other financial liabilities bearing interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from 1 to 6 months. At the financial year end 15% (2021: 15%) of gross debt was held at floating rates.\n\nThe floating rate net debt as set out above, includes cash at bank, which attracts interest at market rates. If the interest rates applicable were to rise by 1% holding all other items constant, the profit of the Group before taxation and non-trading items in the Consolidated Income Statement could increase by 0.6% (2021: 0.8%).",

The Group enters into hedge relationships when there is an economic relationship between the identified notional amount of the underlying debt instrument (hedged item) and the interest rate swap contract (hedged instrument).\n\n## Interest rate swap\n\nAs the critical terms match for the prospective assessment of effectiveness, a qualitative assessment is performed. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship. In instances where changes occur to the hedged item which result in the critical terms no longer matching, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to the credit/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan.\n\n## Cross currency interest rate swap\n\nThe Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness for such swaps as while the critical terms match, both qualitative and quantitative assessments are required to be performed as there remains characteristics in cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being basis risks. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship and at each reporting date.\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months. The classification of the maturity profile of the interest rate derivative contracts are set out in the following tables (a) and (b).\n\nThe tables as set out reflect the hedging relationships affected by interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform) as financial instruments transition to risk free rates. Group treasury are managing the IBOR transition process. The principal change is expected to be for the contractual terms of IBOR-referenced interest rate swaps and debt instruments and the related impact on hedge designation, systems and processes. While general communication with swap and debt counterparties has commenced, no specific changes have been agreed to date. In assessing the potential impact the Group has assumed that the uncertainty in relation to the IBOR reform will remain until the Group has completed specific changes with the swap and debt counterparties and the Group will continue to apply the amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' until this date.",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n## (iii) Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk considers the risk that the Group could encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. There is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group entered 2022 with significant available liquidity and no significant loan maturities arising until April 2023. No significant financing activities were undertaken during 2022.\n\nGroup funding and liquidity is managed by ensuring that sufficient facilities are available from diverse funding sources with an appropriate spread of debt maturities. The Group uses cash flow forecasts to constantly monitor the funding requirements of the Group.\n\nGroup businesses are funded from cash generated from operations, borrowings from banks and Senior Notes from capital markets. It is Group policy to ensure that:\n\n- -sufficient facilities are available to cover its gross forecast debt by at least 1.25 times; and\n- -at least 75% of total facilities available are committed.\n\nBoth targets were met at 31 December 2022 and 2021.\n\nAll Group credit facilities are arranged and managed by Group Treasury and approved by the Board of Directors. Where possible, facilities have common terms and conditions.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had undrawn committed bank facilities of \u20ac1,100m (2021: \u20ac1,100m), and a portfolio of undrawn standby facilities amounting to \u20ac343m (2021: \u20ac337m). The undrawn committed facilities comprise primarily of a revolving credit facility maturing between 3 - 4 years (2021: between 4 - 5 years).\n\n## (iii.i) Contractual maturity profile of non-derivative financial instruments\n\nThe following table details the Group's remaining contractual maturity of its non-derivative financial instruments, including lease liabilities and deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses, excluding the remaining trade and other payables (note 20) and other non-current liabilities (note 22), of which \u20ac1,934.0m (2021: \u20ac1,759.5m) is payable within 1 year, \u20ac78.9m (2021: \u20ac96.7m) between 2 and 5 years. This information has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities to the earliest date on which the Group can be required to repay. The analysis includes both interest commitments and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest rates are floating, the rate used is derived from interest rate yield curves at the end of the reporting date and as such, are subject to change based on market movements.",

To the extent that the amounts payable or receivable are not fixed, the rate used is derived from interest rate yield curves at the end of the reporting date and as such are subject to change based on market movements.\n\n|                                                     | On demand &   up to 1 year   \u20ac'm   | Up to   2 years  \u20ac'm   | 2 - 5   years  \u20ac'm   | > 5 years  \u20ac'm   | Total  \u20ac'm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Interest rate swaps inflow                          | 47.0                               | 4.2                    | 2.9                  | -                | 54.1         |\n| Interest rate swaps outflow                         | (18.4)                             | (12.2)                 | (15.6)               | -                | (46.2)       |\n| Net interest rate swaps inflow/(outflow)            | 28.6                               | (8.0)                  | (12.7)               | -                | 7.9          |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts inflow/(outflow) | 5.7                                | (0.1)                  | -                    | -                | 5.6          |\n| At 31 December 2022                                 | 34.3                               | (8.1)                  | (12.7)               | -                | 13.5         |\n\n|                                            | On demand &  up to 1 year   \u20ac'm   | Up to  2 years  \u20ac'm   | 2 - 5  years  \u20ac'm   | > 5 years \u20ac'm   | Total \u20ac'm   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Interest rate swaps inflow                 | 18.3                              | 33.5                  | 9.9                 | -               | 61.7        |\n| Interest rate swaps outflow                | (12.4)                            | (7.6)                 | (9.3)               | -               | (29.3)      |\n| Net interest rate swaps inflow             | 5.9                               | 25.9                  | 0.6                 | -               | 32.4        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts outflow | (24.9)                            | (0.3)                 | -                   | -               | (25.2)      |\n| At 31 December 2021                        | (19.0)                            | 25.6                  | 0.6                 | -               | 7.2         |\n\nIncluded in the interest rate swaps inflow and outflow is the foreign currency differential on final maturity of the cross currency interest rate swaps as follows:\n\n## Swaps inflow/(outflow)\n\n- -up to 1 year - swaps inflow of \u20ac38.8m (2021: \u20acnil)\n- -1 - 2 years - swaps inflow of \u20acnil (2021: \u20ac25.5m)\n- -2 - 5 years - swaps (outflow)/inflow of (\u20ac7.5m) (2021: \u20ac2.9m)\n\n## (iii.iii) Summary of borrowing arrangements\n\n## (a) Bank loans\n\nBank loans comprise committed term loan facilities, committed revolving credit facilities, bilateral term loans and other uncommitted facilities:\n\n- -demand facilities;\n- -committed revolving credit facilities of \u20ac1,100m to June 2026; and\n- -bilateral term loans with maturities ranging up to 1 year.\n\n## (b) 2031 Euro Senior Notes - public\n\nIn 2021 the Group issued \u20ac750m of euro sustainability-linked bond notes (2031 SLB Senior Notes) at an interest rate of 0.875% with a maturity date on 01 December 2031. The Notes include targets to 1) Reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 against the 2017 baseline; 2) Reduce Food Waste by 50% by 2030 against the 2017 baseline. Should either of these targets not be met by 2030 there is a +0.5% increase in the final interest coupon. If both targets are not met there is a 1% increase in the final interest coupon. The step up in the interest coupon (if any) is payable to investors on the last interest payment date in December 2031.\n\n## (c) 2029 Euro Senior Notes - public (2029 Senior Notes)\n\nIn 2019 the Group issued a 10 year euro note of \u20ac750m at an interest rate of 0.625% with a maturity date on 20 September 2029.\n\n## (d) 2025 Euro Senior Notes - public (2025 Senior Notes)\n\nIn 2015 the Group issued a debut 10 year euro note of \u20ac750m at an interest rate of 2.375% with a maturity date on 10 September 2025.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021 all cash, short-term deposits and other liquid investments had a maturity of less than 3 months. Cash at bank and in hand of \u20ac970.0m (2021: \u20ac1,039.1m) includes an amount of \u20ac322.1m (2021: \u20ac545.0m) held on short-term deposit of which \u20ac70.7m (2021: \u20ac100.0m) was held under a Sustainable Deposits programme.\n\nCredit risk exposure to financial institutions is actively managed across the portfolio of institutions by setting appropriate credit exposure limits based on a value at risk calculation that takes EBITDA of the Group and calculates approved tolerance levels based on credit default swap rates for the financial institutions. These levels are applied in controlling the level of material surplus funds that are placed with counterparties and for controlling the institutions with which the Group enters into derivative contracts. Credit default swaps are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group's exposure to its counterparties is continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions entered into is spread amongst approved counterparties.\n\nTrade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable at operating unit level at least on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk consists of gross trade receivables (note 19), cash deposits (note 23) and other financial assets (note 23), which are primarily interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nThere is no material provision for impairment in the Company's intercompany receivables balance of \u20ac231.0m (2021: \u20ac218.9m) as all amounts are expected to be recovered in full.\n\n## (v) Price risk management\n\nThe Group's exposure to equity securities price risk, due to financial asset investments held, is considered to be low as the level of securities held versus the Group's net assets is not material.\n\n## (vi) Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## (a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are analysed between those based on:\n\n- -quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n- -those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n- -those involving inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).",

This includes equity investments;\n- -other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivatives) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments. This includes interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts which are determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows;\n- -the fair values of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) requires entity specific valuation techniques; and\n- -derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties.",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n## (vii) Offsetting financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is because the Group does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank loans or other credit events. No collateral is paid or received.\n\nThe following table sets out the carrying amounts of recognised financial instruments that are subject to the above agreements.\n\nThe table also sets out where the Group has offset bank overdrafts against cash at bank and in hand based on a legal right of offset as set out in the banking agreements.\n\n|                                    | Gross amounts of financial assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Gross amounts of financial liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Amounts of financial instruments presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Related financial  instruments that are not offset \u20ac'm   | Net amount \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                |                                                                           |                                                                                |                                                                                    |                                                          |                  |\n| Financial assets                   |                                                                           |                                                                                |                                                                                    |                                                          |                  |\n| Cash at bank and in hand           | 970.0                                                                     | -

The provision for these exposures represents amounts provided based on advice from insurance consultants, industry information, actuarial valuation and historical data in respect of claims that are classified as incurred but not reported and outstanding loss reserves. The methodology of estimating the provision is periodically reviewed to ensure that the assumptions made continue to be appropriate. The utilisation of the provision is dependent on the timing of settlement of the outstanding claims. Historically, the average time for settlement of outstanding claims ranges from 2 to 3 years from claim date.\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nNon-trading items relate to restructuring and acquisition integration provisions expensed in 2022 and 2021; these costs are expected to be paid within 18 months.\n\n## Environmental\n\nThis includes provisions for site remediation, restoration and environmental works stemming from established best practice for a recently acquired acquisition. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\n## 26. Retirement benefits obligation\n\nThe Group operates post-retirement benefit schemes in a number of its businesses throughout the world. These schemes are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country they operate in and can include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The assets of the schemes are held, where relevant, in separate trustee administered funds.\n\nDefined benefit post-retirement schemes exist primarily in Ireland and the Netherlands (Eurozone), the UK and the USA (included in Rest of World). These defined benefit schemes comprise final salary pension schemes, career average salary pension schemes and post-retirement medical plans. All material defined benefit pension schemes are closed to future accrual. The post-retirement medical plans operated by the Group relate primarily to a number of USA employees and are closed to new entrants. Defined benefit schemes in Ireland, the UK, and the USA are administered by Boards of Trustees. The Boards of Trustees generally comprise of representatives of the employees, the employer and independent trustees. These Boards are responsible for the management and governance of the schemes including compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.",

        "page_content": "## 26. Retirement benefits obligation (continued)\n\nThe values used in the Group's consolidated financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations and have been updated by the individual schemes' independent and professionally qualified actuaries to incorporate the requirements of IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2022 using the projected unit credit method. All assets in the schemes have been measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Full actuarial valuations for funding purposes are carried out for the Group's pension schemes in line with local requirements. The actuarial reports are not available for public inspection.\n\nThe Group continues to harmonise, standardise and integrate the benefit offering to employees across the countries in which it operates and in 2021 a number of deferred members transferred their past service benefits out of the Irish defined benefit scheme.\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to risks such as interest rate risk, investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the discount rate which is derived from the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. Market conditions in recent years have resulted in volatility in discount rates which has significantly impacted the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Such changes lead to volatility in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Interest rates also impact on the funding requirements for the schemes.\n\n## Investment risk\n\nThe net surplus/(deficit) recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the schemes' assets. When assets generate a rate of return less than the discount rate this results in an increase/(decrease) in the net (deficit)/surplus. The schemes have a diversified portfolio of investments which include equities, bonds and other asset classes. The investment allocation for each scheme is reviewed periodically by the scheme's external investment consultants who advise on the most appropriate asset allocation taking account of asset valuations, funding requirements, liability duration and the achievement of an appropriate return on assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nA significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore an increase in inflation rates will increase the defined benefit obligation. However, a portion of the schemes' assets are inflation-linked debt securities which mitigates some of the effects of inflation movements.\n\n## Mortality risk\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of schemes' participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the schemes' participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## (i) Recognition in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\nThe following amounts have been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in relation to defined contribution and defined benefit post-retirement schemes:\n\n|                                                                             | 2022 \u20ac'm   | 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Service cost:                                                               |            |            |\n| - Costs relating to defined contribution schemes                            | 71.0       | 64.9       |\n| - Current service cost relating to defined benefit schemes                  | 3.0        | 5.5        |\n| - Past service and settlements                                              | (2.0)      | (4.7)      |\n| Net interest (income)/cost                                                  | (1.1)      | 0.7        |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement                             | 70.9       | 66.4       |\n| Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability:                       |            |            |\n| - Return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) | 536.1      | (129.8)    |\n| - Experience losses on schemes' liabilities                                 | 44.4       | 24.9       |\n| - Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions  | (2.6)      | 41.9       |\n| - Actuarial gains arising from changes in financial assumptions             | (564.5)    | (47.2)     |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income            | 13.4       | (110.2)    |\n| Total                                                                       | 84.3       | (43.8)     |\n\nThe total service cost is included in total staff numbers and costs (note 4) and the net interest cost is included in finance income and costs (note 6).",

The life expectancy of a member retiring at 31 December at age 65, now and in 20 years' time, some of which have been shown in range format to reflect the differing assumptions in each scheme, is as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2022           | 2022     | 2022                 | 2021           | 2021     | 2021                  |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------|----------------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|\n|                                     | Eurozone Years | UK Years | Rest of  World Years | Eurozone Years | UK Years | Rest of   World Years |\n| Male - retiring now                 | 22             | 21       | 21 - 22              | 22             | 21       | 21 - 22               |\n| Female - retiring now               | 24             | 24       | 23                   | 24             | 24       | 23                    |\n| Male - retiring in 20 years' time   | 24             | 23       | 22 - 23              | 24             | 23       | 22 - 23               |\n| Female - retiring in 20 years' time | 26             | 26       | 24 - 25              | 26             | 26       | 24 - 25               |\n\nThere are inherent uncertainties surrounding the financial and demographic assumptions adopted by the Group. The assumptions may differ from the actual data as a result of changes in economic and market conditions as well as the actual experience within each scheme. The present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities is heavily dependent on the discount rate. As the discount rate is based on a market driven measure, which is the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date, the present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities can fluctuate significantly from valuation to valuation. The expected rate of inflation impacts the schemes' liabilities in that inflation is the basis for the calculation of the assumed future salary and revaluation increases in each scheme where applicable. In relation to demographic assumptions, differing expectations regarding current and future changes in mortality rates can have a significant impact on the schemes' liabilities.\n\nThe table below gives an approximate indication of the impact of a change in the principal financial actuarial assumptions (discount rate, inflation rate & pension increases and salary increases) and the principal demographic actuarial assumption (mortality) on the schemes' liabilities. The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method. The impact on the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2022 is calculated on the basis that only one assumption is changed with all other assumptions remaining unchanged. The assessment of the sensitivity analysis below could therefore be limited as a change in one assumption may not occur in isolation as assumptions may be correlated. There have been no changes from the previous year in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.\n\n## Impact on schemes' liabilities of changes in assumptions\n\n|                                       | 2022        | 2022   | 2022              | 2021       | 2021   | 2021               |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Change in Assumption                  | Eurozone  % | UK  %  | Rest of  World  % | Eurozone % | UK %   | Rest of   World  % |\n| Discount rate                         |             |        |                   |            |        |                    |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | 8.0%        | 8.2%   | 4.0%              | 10.4%      | 11.0%  | 5.2%               |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | (7.2%)      | (7.3%) | (3.7%)            | (9.0%)     | (9.5%) | (4.7%)             |\n| Inflation Rate and Pension Increases  |             |        |                   |            |        |                    |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | 6.4%        | 3.3%   | -                 | 7.9%       | 4.3%   | -                  |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | (5.8%)      | (3.5%) | -                 | (7.1%)     | (5.2%) | -                  |\n| Salary Increase                       |             |        |                   |            |        |                    |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | -           | -      | 0.2%              | -          | -      | 0.2%               |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | -           | -      | (0.2%)            | -          | -      | (0.2%)             |\n| Mortality                             |             |        |                   |            |        |                    |\n| Increase in life expectancy of 1 Year | 4.1%        | 3.0%   | 2.0%              | 3.9%       | 3.0%   | 2.5%               |\n| Decrease in life expectancy of 1 Year | (4.1%)      | (3.0%) | (2.0%)            | (3.9%)     | (3.0%) | (2.5%)             |",

The schemes' assets are invested with professional investment managers. Investments in the Group's own financial instruments, if any, are solely at the discretion of the investment managers concerned. The actual amount of the Group's own financial instruments held by the pension schemes during 2022 and 2021 were not material. No property held by the pension schemes was occupied by the Group nor were any other pension schemes' assets used by the Group during 2022 or 2021.\n\nThe Irish, UK and USA schemes have invested in Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. The primary goal of this asset class is to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows required to pay benefits. The LDI solutions invest in various levered and unlevered bonds and the value of the LDI assets at 31 December 2022 across the schemes was \u20ac488.3m (2021: \u20ac537.7m) which is based on the latest market bid price for the underlying investments, which are traded daily on liquid markets.\n\n## (v) Funding for defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in a number of countries and each scheme is required to be operated in line with local legislation, conditions, practices and the regulatory framework in place for the specific country. As a result, there are a number of different funding arrangements in place that accord with the specific local legislative, regulatory and actuarial requirements.\n\nFunding for each scheme is carried out by cash contributions from the Group's subsidiaries. These funding arrangements have been advised by the pension schemes' actuaries and agreed between the Group and the relevant Trustees. Actuarial valuations, which are not available for public inspection, are carried out every three years in Ireland and the UK; and every year in the USA. During the financial year ending 31 December 2023, the Group expects to make contributions of approximately \u20ac12.8m to its defined benefit schemes.\n\n## 27.

In 2022 and 2021, no shares were purchased under this programme.\n\n## 28. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment plans. The first plan is the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the second is the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options after a 2 year deferral period. Details on each of the Group's plans are outlined below and are the same as those recognised in the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Group recognised an expense of \u20ac22.9m (2021: \u20ac17.2m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The expectation of meeting performance criteria was taken into account when calculating this expense.\n\n## (i) Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe Group operates an equity-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which an invitation to participate was made to Executive Directors and senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance, Total Shareholder Return (TSR), Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) and Sustainability metrics of the Group during a three year period ('the performance period'). The invitations made in 2020, 2021 and 2022 will potentially vest in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. 50% of the award will be issued at the date of vesting, with 50% being issued after a 2 year deferral period.\n\nFor the 2020 awards, up to 50% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's Adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis compared with target during the performance period. Up to 30% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's TSR performance during the performance period measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. The remaining 20% of the shares/share options will vest according to the Group's ROACE versus predetermined targets. For the 2021 and 2022 awards, the performance conditions are weighted 40% for Adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis, 25% for TSR, 15% for ROACE and the remaining 20% of the shares/share options will vest according to the Group's Sustainability metrics versus predetermined targets. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.\n\nUnder the LTIP, the Group introduced career shares awards, under which an invitation to participate was made to a limited number of senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on personal objectives during a three year period ('the performance period') and the senior executives remaining within the Group for a four year period ('the retention period'). The invitations made in 2017 - 2020 will potentially vest in 2023 - 2026 respectively. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.",

Market based vesting conditions, such as the TSR condition, have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted. The TSR performance over the period is measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. Non-market based performance conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, however the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction is adjusted so that the amount recognised is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.\n\n## (ii) Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2013 the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for Executive Directors was amended to incorporate a share-based payment element with 33% of the total bonus to be settled in shares/share options. The shares/share options awarded as part of this scheme will be issued 2 years after the vesting date once a deferral period has elapsed. There are no further performance conditions relating to the shares/share options during the deferral period.\n\nThere are 9,200 share options (2021: 4,632 share options) outstanding and exercisable in relation to the STIP.\n\nA share-based payment expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the scheme to reflect the cash value of the bonus to be paid by way of shares/share options. The issuance of shares/share options under the STIP which related to the 2021 and 2022 financial years will be released from deferral in 2023 and 2024 respectively.",

Given that the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities recently acquired is still in progress, some of the above values are determined provisionally, primarily values relating to property, plant and equipment and liabilities (as not all information is available at this point in time). The valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period. For the acquisitions completed in 2021, there have been no material revisions of the provisional fair value adjustments since the initial values were established. The Group performs quantitative and qualitative assessments of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. None of the acquisitions completed during the period were considered material to warrant separate disclosure.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable to the expected profitability, revenue growth, future market development and assembled workforce of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise within the Group after the acquisition. \u20ac30.3m of goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nTransaction expenses related to these acquisitions of \u20ac6.5m were charged in the Group's Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of \u20ac10.2m and a gross contractual value of \u20ac10.4m .\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Group and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are distinguished from the Group's shareholders' equity. Where not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interests are recognised at the non-controlling interest's share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.\n\nThe revenue and profit after taxation attributable to equity holders of the parent to the Group contributed from date of acquisition for all business combinations effected during the financial year is as follows:\n\n|                                                                    |   Total 2022 \u20ac'm |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Revenue                                                            |            103.2 |\n| Profit after taxation attributable to equity holders of the parent |             11.3 |\n\nThe revenue and profit after taxation attributable to equity holders of the parent to the Group determined in accordance with IFRS as though the acquisition date for all business combinations effected during the financial year had been the beginning of that financial year would be as follows:\n\n|                                                                    |   2022 acquisitions \u20ac'm | Kerry Group  excluding 2022 acquisitions \u20ac'm   | Consolidated Group including acquisitions \u20ac'm   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                            |                   174.7 | 8,668.7                                        | 8,843.4                                         |\n| Profit after taxation attributable to equity holders of the parent |                    15.9 | 595.1                                          | 611.0                                           |\n\n## 31.

The LTIP accounting charge above is determined in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for share-based payments.\n\nPost-retirement benefits in the above table and the statutory and listing rules disclosure in respect of pension contributions in the Executive Directors' remuneration table in the remuneration report are determined on a current service cost basis.\n\nThe aggregate amount of gains accruing to Executive Directors on the exercise of share options is \u20acnil (2021: \u20acnil). Dividends totalling \u20ac0.1m (2021: \u20ac0.1m) were also received by key management personnel during the financial year, based on their personal interests in the shares of the company.\n\n## 34. Events after the balance sheet date\n\nSince the financial year end, the Group has:\n\n- -entered into exclusive negotiations prior to the year ended 31 December 2022 to sell the trade and assets of its Sweet Ingredients Portfolio, for a consideration of \u20ac500m comprising an initial cash consideration of \u20ac375m plus a \u20ac125m interest bearing vendor loan note as announced on 11 January 2023. The potential sale is subject to relevant regulatory approvals, employee consultation and routine closing adjustments. The associated assets and liabilities have consequently been\n- presented separately as assets held for sale (note 18) in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022; and -proposed a final dividend of 73.40 cent per A ordinary share (note 10).\n\nThere have been no other significant events, outside the ordinary course of business, affecting the Group since 31 December 2022.\n\n## 35. Reserves\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve (FVOCI)\n\nThe fair value through other comprehensive income reserve represents the unrealised gains and losses on the financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income by the Group.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nCapital redemption reserve represents the nominal cost of the cancelled shares in 2007.\n\n## Other undenominated capital\n\nOther undenominated capital represents the amount transferred to reserves as a result of renominalising the share capital of the Parent Company due to the euro conversion in 2002.\n\n## Share-based payment reserve\n\nThe share-based payment reserve relates to invitations made to employees to participate in the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options. Further information in relation to share-based payments is set out in note 28.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nExchange differences relating to the translation of the balance sheets of the Group's foreign currency operations from their functional currencies to the Group's presentation currency (euro) are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThe hedging reserve represents the effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments from the application of cash flow hedge accounting for which the underlying hedged transaction is not impacting profit or loss. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is reclassified to profit or loss only when the hedged transaction affects the profit or loss.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe cost of hedging reserve arises from where the Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps. Such cross currency interest rate swaps have basis risk as there are characteristics in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being currency basis spreads.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings refers to the portion of net income, which is retained by the Group rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Group.",

These KPIs help inform decision making, assist effective goal setting and track progress in achieving the Group's strategic objectives. Kerry believes that long-term sustainable success will be achieved by generating value for all stakeholders, while developing and monitoring strategy, managing the risks that face the organisation and embedding the Group's purpose and values. Non-financial key performance indicators are outlined in pages 38-39, while the principal financial definitions used by the Group, together with reconciliations where the non-IFRS measures are not readily identifiable from the financial statements, are as follows:\n\n## 1.   Revenue\n\n## Volume growth\n\nThis represents the sales growth year-on-year, excluding pass-through pricing on input costs, currency impacts, acquisitions, disposals and rationalisation volumes.\n\nVolume growth is an important metric as it is seen as the key driver of organic top-line business improvement. Pricing impacts revenue growth positively or negatively depending on whether inputs move up or down. A full reconciliation to reported revenue growth is detailed in the revenue reconciliation below.\n\n## Revenue Reconciliation\n\n| 2022              | Volume   growth   | Price   | Transaction  currency   | Acquisitions   | Disposals   | Translation  currency   | Reported  revenue   growth   |\n|-------------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition | 7.8%              | 8.7%    | 0.2%                    | 5.6%           | (1.1%)      | 8.2%                    | 29.4%                        |\n| Dairy Ireland     | 0.1%              | 22.8%   | 0.1%                    | -              | (37.6%)     | 1.2%                    | (13.4%)                      |\n| Group             | 6.1%              | 11.7%   | 0.2%                    | 4.3%           | (9.8%)      | 6.8%                    | 19.3%                        |\n| 2021              |                   |         |                         |                |             |                         |                              |\n| Taste & Nutrition | 8.7%              | 0.9%    | -                       | 2.4%           | -           | (2.8%)                  | 9.2%                         |\n| Dairy Ireland     | 6.2%              | 1.8%    | -                       | -              | (13.0%)     | 1.1%                    | (3.9%)                       |\n| Group             | 8.0%              | 1.2%    | -                       | 1.8%           | (3.5%)      | (1.8%)                  | 5.7%                         |\n\nPrior year 31 December 2021 has been re-presented to reflect the changes in our reporting segments in line with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Executive Directors) assesses the Group's performance from 1 January 2022.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Performance in Adjusted Earnings Per Share on a Constant Currency Basis\n\nThe performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is provided as it is considered more reflective of the Group's underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings is profit after taxation attributable to equity holders of the parent before brand related intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (net of related tax). These items are excluded in order to assist in the understanding of underlying earnings. A full reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings is provided below. Constant currency eliminates the translational effect that arises from changes in foreign currency year-on-year. The performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is calculated by comparing current year adjusted earnings per share to the prior year adjusted earnings per share retranslated at current year average exchange rates.\n\n|                                                                                                | 2022 EPS cent   | Performance %   | 2021 EPS cent   | Performance %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                       | 341.9           | (20.6%)         | 430.6           | 37.6%           |\n| Brand related intangible asset amortisation                                                    | 28.7            | -               | 26.0            | -               |\n| Non-trading items (net of related tax)                                                         | 70.0            | -               | (75.8)          | -               |\n| Adjusted earnings per share                                                                    | 440.6           | 15.7%           | 380.8           | 10.2%           |\n| Impact of retranslating prior year adjusted earnings per share at  current year average rates* |                 | (8.4%)          |                 | 1.9%            |\n| Growth in adjusted earnings per share on a constant  currency basis                            |                 | 7.3%            |                 | 12.1%           |\n\n- * Impact of 2022 translation was (31.9)/380.8 cent = (8.4%) (2021: 1.9%).\n\n## 6.  Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is EBITDA plus movement in average working capital, capital expenditure (net), payment of lease liabilities, pensions contributions paid less pension expense, finance costs paid (net) and income taxes paid.\n\nFree cash flow is seen as an important indicator of the strength and quality of the business and of the availability to the Group of funds for reinvestment or for return to shareholders. Movement in average working capital is used when calculating free cash flow as management believes this provides a more accurate measure of the increase or decrease in working capital needed to support the business over the course of the year rather than at two distinct points in time and more accurately reflects fluctuations caused by seasonality and other timing factors. Average working capital is the sum of each month's working capital over 12 months. Below is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest IFRS measure, which is 'Net cash from operating activities'.\n\n|                                                                                                                        | 2022 \u20ac'm   | 2021 \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Net cash from operating activities                                                                                     | 721.8      | 654.0      |\n| Difference between movement in monthly average working capital and movement in the  financial year end working capital | 22.6       | 146.6      |\n| Share of joint ventures' results after taxation*                                                                       | -          | 3.9        |\n| Payments on non-trading items                                                                                          | 85.4       | 76.1       |\n| Purchase of assets (net)                                                                                               | (221.0)    | (300.4)    |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                                                                                           | (35.1)     | (34.9)     |\n| Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment                                                                | 38.1       | 19.4       |\n| Capital grants received                                                                                                | 1.4        | 0.7        |\n| Exchange translation adjustment                                                                                        | 27.2       | 0.7        |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                         | 640.4      | 566.1      |",
