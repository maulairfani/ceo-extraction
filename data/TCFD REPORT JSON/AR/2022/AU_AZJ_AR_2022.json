The focus for Aurizon is the integration of the One Rail Bulk operations and the divestment of East Coast Rail. This divestment will be undertaken either through a demerger or trade sale, whichever creates greater shareholder value. The financial e/ffects of the transaction have not been recognised at 30 June 2022, refer to note 31 for further information.\n\n## Outlook\n\nUnderlying group EBITDA guidance for FY2023 of $1,470m to $1,550m and non-growth capital expenditure of $500m to $550m. This guidance includes the impact from wet weather in July 2022 and 11 months of contribution from One Rail Bulk with key assumptions as follows:\n\n- \u203a Coal - volume expected to increase but EBITDA to be lower due to revenue yield reduction\n- \u203a Bulk - revenue and EBITDA growth from increased volumes and services and the inclusion of One Rail Bulk\n- \u203a Network - flat EBITDA assuming volumes align to regulatory forecast, with higher FY2023 MAR o/ffset by the non-recurring catch-up of historical WIRP fees\n- \u203a No material disruptions to commodity supply chains (such as extreme or prolonged wet weather and/or significant impacts from COVID-19 related disruptions)\n- \u203a East Coast Rail is excluded from guidance as it will be classified as a discontinued operation held for sale from acquisition and no dividend will be paid during Aurizon Holdings' ownership.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nI am pleased to present our FY2022 Annual Report.\n\nIt has been a challenging but productive year for Aurizon. We have navigated a number of significant headwinds to deliver a solid financial, operational and safety performance. At the same time, we have continued to work hard on transformation initiatives and the securing of long-term growth opportunities for the business.\n\nAurizon delivered Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) of $1,468 million in FY2022, which is in the middle of our guidance range of $1,425$1,500 million. This was a good result in a year when our above rail and network volumes were lower than we expected.\n\nAurizon's business model and financial performance has remained resilient despite many challenges through the year, and ongoing issues facing the Australian and global economies. Like other Australian businesses, Aurizon is also facing rising costs and a tight labour market for skilled employees, including train crew.\n\nAurizon has a number of revenue protections in its above rail haulage contracts and network regulatory arrangements to help mitigate the impact of inflation, higher energy costs and lower tonnages. This has helped support strong, stable cash flow and returns for the business. Significant events in FY2022 that impacted our business included:\n\n- \u203a major flooding in parts of Queensland and New South Wales that disrupted operations of rail and port infrastructure and lowered the production levels of our mining and agricultural customers, resulting in reduced haulage tonnes for Aurizon's Bulk and Coal businesses; and\n- \u203a the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customers' production (primarily labour interruptions and supply chain constraints), which escalated as borders were re-opened and further outbreaks occurred with Omicron variants, resulting in lower demand for our rail haulage services.\n\nThe Board has declared a final dividend of 10.9 cents per share, 100% franked. This will take total dividends in respect of FY2022 to 21.4 cents. As advised in February 2022, we reduced our dividend payout ratio to 75% to support Aurizon's commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings as we complete the acquisition of One Rail Australia Holdings LP (ORA). Including this final dividend, Aurizon has returned to shareholders $4.8 billion over the past seven years through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nA\n\nTo date Aurizon has been largely successful in continuing to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic period without major interruptions to our business. Across our national footprint, local workplaces have done a good job in protecting the health and well-being of employees while ensuring transport and access services continued for our customers and for the benefit of the broader economy.\n\nIn terms of operational safety, the Board is pleased to note the improvement in FY2022 across our key safety metrics, together with a range of initiatives to support our employees' physical and mental well-being. Our Managing Director & CEO, Andrew Harding, shares more detail in his report on the following page.\n\nAfter year end, on 14 July 2022, we welcomed regulatory approval of our $2,350 million acquisition of ORA, which Aurizon first announced in October 2021. This has involved substantial work to date by the Aurizon project and Bulk teams and we are now focused on finalising all elements of the transaction.\n\nThe acquisition sets the stage for the next growth phase for Aurizon, aligned with our strategy to extend our reach into new commodity-rich regions of Australia. It is also a key plank in re-balancing Aurizon's portfolio over the next decade, with our Bulk business positioned to assume a greater proportion of Group revenue and earnings compared to coalrelated earnings. While high-quality Australian metallurgical and thermal coal remains in high demand globally and continues to be a strong revenue and earnings source for Aurizon, we view the transition to a lower-carbon world as a major opportunity for the Australian economy and for Aurizon. Australia has an abundance of critical minerals and agricultural produce that will help fuel and feed economies across the globe in the decades to follow. With the ORA acquisition coupled with our existing Bulk business, Aurizon is well-positioned in those regions producing these commodities, in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.\n\nA range of initiatives are underway to reduce our carbon footprint and to deliver lower carbon supply chains for our customers. These are captured in Aurizon's Climate Strategy and Action Plan that was released in 2020 and which provides our roadmap to reach a target of net-zero operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 2050. During the year, work was advanced on developing low-carbon technologies for our locomotive fleet including collaborating with global mining company Anglo American on a study to assess the introduction of hydrogenpowered freight trains.\n\nWork is also continuing with the University of Queensland and Central Queensland University on rollingstock and infrastructure requirements for battery and hydrogenpowered rail solutions. In June 2022, Aurizon Network finalised a new electricity contract for our Central Queensland Coal Network which includes 25% of energy acquired from renewable sources such as solar and wind farms.\n\nWe know that rail is already the safest, most e/fficient and lowest-carbon solution for the land transport of bulk freight. Rapidly developing battery and hydrogen technology o/ffers an exciting opportunity to take it to the next level, where we can significantly lower emissions for Aurizon, our customers and the national economy. Zero or low-carbon supply chains not only provide environmental benefits for the community but also deliver competitive advantage for Australian companies and our export industries in global markets.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous e/ffort and commitment of our employees across the business during the last year. Many parts of our operations dealt with unprecedented flooding events, and all areas of Aurizon worked hard to manage the health and operational impacts of the pandemic. The Board also extends its thanks and appreciation to our Managing Director & CEO, Andrew Harding, and his leadership team in guiding the Company through this period and ensuring our focus remained on delivering safe and reliable services for our customers.\n\nI also acknowledge the contribution of Michael Fraser who retired as a Director of the Company in February 2022. Michael was a highly e/ffective and valuable Director of Aurizon and Chairman of Aurizon Network over six years. His experience and insight, particularly in relation to regulatory, competition and legal issues was of great value to the Aurizon Board and management team.\n\nFinally, thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. We have worked hard to improve and re-position the Company in recent years, building on a strong platform of performance in our above rail and network coal businesses and pivoting to new growth opportunities in future-facing markets for our Bulk business. With the ORA acquisition, Aurizon is now entering its next stage of growth where we continue our commitment to create value and deliver returns for shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole\n\nChairman\n\n8 August 2022",

        "page_content": "## Managing Director & CEO's Report\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nI open my report to you for FY2022 by addressing our operational safety performance and measures to support the health and wellbeing of our employees.\n\nAs I write, another wave of COVID-19 has emerged in parallel with a worse than usual flu season. It is a time for renewed vigilance in our communities and businesses, so we can continue the gradual return to our regular lives. Likewise in Aurizon, we are remaining vigilant across our workplaces to protect the health and well-being of our employees while continuing to deliver for customers and for the Australian economy. Many of the specific health and hygiene measures we adopted early in the pandemic in 2020 have become a normal part of our working lives, just like they have in the community. Practices such as social distancing, heightened cleaning regimes and good hygiene are supporting improved health and productivity outcomes, now and for the longer term. Our frontline teams have done an excellent job in remaining disciplined and diligent in the workplace, allowing the continued delivery of safe, reliable services for customers.\n\nFlexible working for non-operational employees has become standard practice in Aurizon. Teams have found new ways to connect and to collaborate in this hybrid environment, travel requirements and costs have reduced, and technology solutions continue to evolve to support improved productivity.\n\nWe know our employees are our greatest asset and absolutely fundamental to our Company's continued success. Supporting healthy employees and healthy communities is a solid investment in our collective futures. In recent years we have stepped up mental health initiatives across the business, recognising the extra challenges that arrived with COVID-19. For example, Aurizon's Mental Health Peer Support Program has established a network of volunteer Mental Health First Aiders. The program provides volunteers from each site/business unit with the skills required to confidently support their peers in times of need, before (if required) accessing professional services provided by Aurizon.\n\nThrough our Community Giving Fund, Aurizon supports the health and well-being of local communities where our people live and work. In FY2022, we provided grants to 43 charities and community organisations in the areas of health and well-being, safety, education and environment. More than 500 groups have benefitted from grants over the past 11 years, which represents a major commitment by Aurizon in delivering social value to the communities in which our business operates.\n\nIt's been a little over 12 months since Aurizon launched our national partnership with Orange Sky Australia, the world's first free mobile laundry service for people experiencing homelessness. Aurizon's partnership has assisted Orange Sky maintain and grow their operations across Australia. It has also connected Aurizon's team in volunteering and fundraising e/fforts across numerous campaigns.\n\nTurning now to operational safety performance, I am pleased to report significant improvements in safety as we work at Aurizon to protect ourselves, each other and our communities. Importantly, none of our people was seriously injured while at work.\n\nThe Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate improved 17.6% against the prior financial year. Incident severity continues to reduce with soft tissue injuries (low severity body strains) being the most common. Several injury prevention and management initiatives to reduce the frequency of low severity injuries were implemented in FY2022. Rail Process Safety, which measures operational rail safety, including derailments, signals passed at danger, and rollingstock collisions, improved by 17.3% compared to FY2021. Aurizon continues to progress several strategic initiatives, including a focus on improving yard safety interfaces to reduce the number of yard incidents.\n\nAs the Chairman outlined in his report, the Company has delivered good financial results despite the economic disruption of COVID-19 and extreme weather events in Queensland and New South Wales. At a group level, Aurizon delivered Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) of $1,468 million in FY2022. Below is an overview of performance in each of our three business units.\n\n## Aurizon Bulk\n\nAfter a number of years of rapid growth, FY2022 was a year of consolidation and investment for the Bulk business. It also experienced a range of impacts that lowered volumes including major flooding events, COVID-related disruptions and customer-specific reductions in production. Bulk's EBITDA in FY2022 was $130 million, down 7% compared to FY2021.\n\nBulk incurred start-up costs in FY2022 for new long-term business secured during the year, including a 6+4-year contract for CBH grain haulage in Western Australia and a 5+5-year contract with Tronox for the transcontinental haul of mineral sands concentrate from New South Wales to Western Australia (WA). Other contracts won during the year included a five-year contract extension with Alcoa WA for alumina and associated inputs and a five-year contract with rare earths producer Lynas in WA. In December 2021, the Queensland Government advised we had been unsuccessful in retaining the livestock contract in North Queensland.\n\nWe were pleased to complete the acquisition of One Rail Australia in July 2022. This will result in an uplift in revenues and tonnages for the Bulk business, with strong opportunities as we expand into commodity-rich regions of South Australia (SA) and the Northern Territory (NT). We will now also progress the divestment of One Rail Australia's coal haulage business, which we refer to as East Coast Rail.\n\n## Aurizon Coal\n\nAlthough overall tonnages of 194 million tonnes in FY2022 were down 4% compared to FY2021, the business has delivered a solid financial result with EBITDA of $541 million, 1% more than the prior year. This is primarily the result of improved yield on contracted tonnes and lower costs for track access, train crew and maintenance.\n\nDuring FY2022, the Coal business secured a number of contracts including a 10-year haulage agreement with Pembroke Resources for the new Olive Downs metallurgical coal mine in Queensland, due to commence in late 2023; and a five-year extension for Baralaba Coal in Queensland. In addition, Aurizon remains the primary hauler for South Walker Creek and Poitrel mines in Queensland, following the sale of these mines to Stanmore during FY2022. Two contracts ended during FY2022, both in December 2021. These were New Hope's New Acland mine (end of mine life) and Yancoal's Moolarben mine.\n\n## Aurizon Network\n\nThe Network business achieved EBITDA of $801 million, down 6% compared to FY2021. Revenue reduced by 3%, with volumes lower than the regulatory forecast in FY2022 resulting in an under-recovery of revenue. Despite higher global market demand for Australian coal, largely as a result of the embargo on Russian coal supplies, volumes across the Central Queensland Coal Network declined by 1% to 206.5 million tonnes. The volume reductions were largely attributable to wet weather, mine-specific maintenance and production issues as well as COVID-19 related restrictions and disruptions.\n\nIn closing, I extend my gratitude to the continuing e/fforts and dedication of Aurizon teams across the country. In July 2022, we have welcomed 400+ new employees to the Company as we expand our national footprint to SA and NT. I look forward to their contribution in growing our business and delivering each and every day for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAndrew Harding Managing Director & CEO 8 August 2022",

The dividend will be 100% franked and is payable on 21 September 2022.\n\n## State of a/ffairs\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors, there were no significant changes in the state of a/ffairs of the Company that occurred during the financial year under review.\n\n## Events since the end of the financial/uni00A0year\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any events or developments which are not set out in this report or note 31 of the Financial Report that have, or would have, a significant e/ffect on the Group's state of a/ffairs, its operations or its expected results in future years.\n\nSince the end of the financial year, the acquisition of One Rail LP completed on 29 July 2022. Refer to note 31 for further/uni00A0information.\n\n## Likely developments\n\nInformation about likely developments in the operations of the Group and the expected results of those operations are covered in the Chairman's Report set out on page 2 of this report and the Managing Director & CEO's Report set out on page 3 of this report, and at a high level in the outlook provided on page 1 of this report.\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors, disclosure of any further information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.\n\n## E/ffective governance for sustainability\n\nWe believe corporate governance is a critical pillar on which our business objectives and, in turn, shareholder value must be built. The Board has adopted a suite of charters and key corporate governance documents that articulate the policies and procedures our business follows in achieving our objectives.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nOur Board is structured to include a range of optimum skills that enable the e/ffective governance of our business. We carefully consider the character, experience, education and skill set as well as interests and associations of potential candidates for appointment to the Board, and we conduct appropriate checks to verify the suitability of candidates before their appointment. Our Board members possess a range of skills and experience across areas such as strategy, transactions, technology, sustainability, industry, government, and community relations/uni00A0and governance (see pages 7 to 8 of this report for more detail). Therefore, our Board is well equipped to consider a range of sustainability-/uni00A0related issues.\n\n## Committees and meetings\n\nThe Board provides oversight and strategic direction to sustainability and has ultimate responsibility for our Company's consideration of climate-related risk. It is guided by our Audit, Governance and Risk Management Committee (AGRMC) and Safety, Health and Environment Committee (SHEC) as part of our risk framework and broader corporate strategy and planning.\n\nThe AGRMC includes several members of the Board, including the Chairman, and is responsible for reviewing our governance policies, framework and compliance. The SHEC is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on matters relating to safety, health and environmental performance and policies.\n\nThe Board understands that climate change is one of the key interests for stakeholders. Following the launch of the Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP) during FY2021, the cross-functional CSAP Steering Committee has/uni00A0continued to guide the implementation of the CSAP and to align initiatives under the three key pillars: Manage Risk and Build Resilience; Deliver Decarbonisation; and Create/uni00A0Carbon Abatement Opportunities.\n\nDiscussions across a range of sustainabilityrelated topics, including climate change, occur frequently at Board meetings. During FY2022, the Board:\n\n- \u203a provided guidance and approval of the Sustainability Report and the implementation of the CSAP\n- \u203a oversaw progress and implementation of/uni00A0the CSAP\n- \u203a were directly engaged in reviewing the scenarios for consideration under our Strategy in Uncertainty Framework, as well as/uni00A0developing plans and initiatives to position/uni00A0the organisation to mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities. This strategic process is repeated at least annually/uni00A0to ensure that our strategic priorities are continually updated so we can/uni00A0proactively respond to emerging market/uni00A0dynamics and/uni00A0opportunities.\n\n## Embedding sustainability into decision-making\n\nThe AGRMC Charter acknowledges the need for the Board and, in turn, management to maintain e/ffective risk management to identify and manage risks. This includes, but is not limited to, contemporary or emerging risks, such as conduct risk, digital disruption, and cyber risks, and climate change and sustainability risks. A copy of the charter is/uni00A0available in the Governance section of our/uni00A0website.",

        "page_content": "In that regard, climate change risk is incorporated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework and is therefore specifically considered during investment decisions. Our Executive Committee and AGRMC regularly review and update the enterprise risk profile that applies the Enterprise Risk Management Framework to/uni00A0identify and rate enterprise-level risks for our/uni00A0Company.\n\nThe internal management process governing investment decisions, the Aurizon Investment Standard, has also been updated to ensure management considers climate change risk and carbon pricing on a materiality basis in decisions to recommend capital investment.\n\n## Managing sustainability performance through targets and monitoring\n\nWe continue to manage our progress as an organisation by monitoring our performance against key sustainability targets and objectives. Examples include (but are not limited to):\n\n- \u203a a net-zero operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 2050 target\n- \u203a an additional emissions intensity reduction target of 10% by 2030 1 to maintain an emphasis on using existing capabilities and assets in the near term\n- \u203a two primary safety metrics to measure safety outcomes across the enterprise: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Potential Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFR(a+p))\n- \u203a gender representation on the Board\n- \u203a representation of women in senior executive/uni00A0roles\n- \u203a representation of women in the workforce\n- \u203a representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women in the/uni00A0workforce.\n\nAt the start of the performance year, the Board determines individual strategic measures for the Managing Director & CEO. These measures are based on our strategy of continuing to optimise, excel and extend the business. Relevant measures are subsequently cascaded to the Executive Committee and throughout the organisation.\n\n## Environmental and Cultural Heritage regulation and performance\n\nAurizon is committed to managing its operational activities and services in an environmentally responsible manner to meet legal, social and moral obligations. To deliver on this commitment, Aurizon seeks to comply with all applicable laws and regulations that have an environmental or cultural heritage/uni00A0focus.\n\nAurizon contributed to reducing horn impacts on the community, while maintaining safe operations, by playing a key role in the development of the 2022 Rail Industry Safety and Standard Board's Rail Tra/ffic Horn Use Code of Practice. In NSW, where noise remains a focus of the EPA's rollingstock licensing, Aurizon's operations continue to be/uni00A0compliant.\n\nIn FY2022, Aurizon completed a comprehensive review of its Cultural Heritage (CH) management resources. This involved detailed gap analyses of existing CH documentation, statutory obligations and current agreements with Aboriginal parties. The analyses yielded a CH Action Plan and specialist CH and legal consultants were engaged to advise on development of a CH Governance Framework (CHGF) with key success criteria being that it must be:\n\n- \u203a contemporary, enabling Aurizon to/uni00A0meet its regulatory obligations\n- \u203a expanded such that it applies to Aurizon's national operational footprint\n- \u203a aware of both Aboriginal and non-Indigenous CH;\n- \u203a e/ffectively communicated, practical and simple to implement.\n\nLeading the CHGF is the CH Commitment Statement, which is ' to minimise our impact on Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural heritage through a framework founded on knowledge, understanding and respect '. The Commitment Statement is underpinned by an implementation framework, which:\n\n- \u203a specifies jurisdictional requirements\n- \u203a articulates organisational responsibilities and accountabilities\n- \u203a outlines, through bespoke guidelines and procedures, how Aurizon's CH obligations are to be achieved during the planning and execution of work, including engagement with Aboriginal parties.\n\nThe CHGF was launched in November 2021 and is available to all employees and contractors. For the Central Queensland Coal Network, the CHGF is further supported by an online mapping resource that provides additional guidance to enable compliant interface with areas of CH value. Two online modules are available which promote awareness of CH, provide linkages to the CHGF and outline scenarios that demonstrate how CH values are protected during the conduct of work. The modules are mandatory for roles where there is a reasonable likelihood of encountering CH during the ordinary conduct of work.\n\nThe National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER) (Cth) requires the Group to report its annual greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. The Group has implemented systems and processes for the collection and calculation of the data required and is registered under the NGER Act.\n\nAt the close of the fifth Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism (Safeguard) compliance period (ended on 30 June 2021), three of Aurizon's NGER facilities were captured. Through e/ffective management of the Company's emissions, Aurizon remained below its respective baselines and achieved full compliance with the Safeguard. Following amendments to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015 in 2019, Aurizon has successfully transitioned all facilities remaining on reported baselines to production-adjusted baselines.\n\nFurther details of the Company's climate and environmental performance will be published in Aurizon's forthcoming Sustainability Report, which will be published in October 2022.\n\n## Environmental and Cultural Heritage/uni00A0prosecutions\n\nAurizon did not incur any monetary fines, nor/uni00A0was it subject to any prosecutions related to environment or cultural heritage regulations in FY2022.",

Aurizon fosters a risk- aware culture through the application of high-quality, integrated risk assessments to support informed decision-making.\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management, which considers a wide range of risks within strategic planning. Aurizon has a commitment to e/ffective risk management as a key element of business success.\n\nThe AGRMC monitors management's performance against Aurizon's risk management framework, including whether it is operating within the risk appetite set by the Board (see page 54 of this Annual Report). The Company's Risk and Assurance Function is responsible for providing oversight of the risk management framework and assurance on the management of significant risks to the Managing Director & CEO and the Board.\n\nAurizon's risk-aware culture has an emphasis on frontline accountability for e/ffective risk management. The consideration of risk features heavily in our thinking, from the framing of strategy through to informing decision-making. Aurizon's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Appetite and supporting Risk Assessment Procedure are aligned to the international standard for risk management (AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018), supports the identification, assessment and reporting of risk across the business, and includes both financial and non-financial risks.\n\nProcesses exist for the prevention, detection and management of fraud within the Company,/uni00A0and for fair dealing in matters pertaining to fraud.\n\nFurther details of risks and risk management are set out on pages 24-30 of the Directors' Report.\n\n## CEO and CFO declaration\n\nThe Managing Director & CEO and Chief Financial O/fficer (CFO) have provided a written statement to the Board in accordance with Section 295A of the Corporations Act.\n\nWith regard to the financial records and systems of risk management and internal compliance in this written statement, the Board received assurance from the Managing Director & CEO and CFO that the declaration was founded on a sound system of risk management and internal control, and that the system was operating e/ffectively in all material respects in relation to the reporting of/uni00A0financial/uni00A0risks.\n\n## Indemnification and insurance of/uni00A0o/fficers\n\nThe Company's Constitution provides that the Company may indemnify any person who is, or has been, an o/fficer of the Group, including the Directors and Company Secretary, against liabilities incurred while acting as such o/fficers to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe Company has entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each of the Company's Directors. No Director or o/fficer of the Company has received benefits under an/uni00A0indemnity from the Company during or since the end of the year.\n\nThe Company has paid a premium for insurance for o/fficers of the Group. This insurance is against a liability for costs and expenses incurred by o/fficers in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such o/fficers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## Proceedings against the Company\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any current civil litigation proceedings, arbitration proceedings, administration appeals or criminal or governmental prosecutions of a material nature that are not set out in this report or note 30 of the Financial Report in which Aurizon Holdings is directly or indirectly concerned which are likely to have a material adverse e/ffect on the business or financial position of/uni00A0the Company.\n\n## Remuneration Report\n\nThe Remuneration Report is set out on pages 33-48 and forms part of the Directors' Report for the financial year ended/uni00A030/uni00A0June/uni00A02022.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe amounts contained in this report and in the/uni00A0financial statements have been rounded to/uni00A0the nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated (where rounding is applicable) in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding/uni00A0in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 . The/uni00A0Company is an entity/uni00A0to which/uni00A0the instrument applies.\n\n## External audit services\n\nDeloitte were appointed at the 12 October 2021 Annual General Meeting as the Company's external auditor commencing for the year ending 30 June 2022.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nDuring the year, the Company's auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte), performed other services in addition to its audit responsibilities, the majority of which commenced prior to Deloitte's appointment as auditor and have now been completed.\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by Deloitte during the reporting period did not compromise the auditor independence requirements set out in/uni00A0the Corporations Act .\n\nAll non-audit services were subject to the Company's Non-Audit Services Policy and do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or/uni00A0decision-making capacity for the Company, or jointly sharing risks and rewards.\n\nMs Lewis, Chair of the Audit, Governance &/uni00A0Risk/uni00A0Management Committee, is a former partner of Deloitte, having retired in March 2014.

Bulk EBITDA also declined mainly due to lower iron ore volumes, approximately $10m one-o/ff items including weather, start-up costs and the impact from a major customer shut-down which more than o/ffset new customer growth, some of which were not operational for the full financial year. These declines more than o/ffset growth in EBITDA for Coal which was driven by higher revenue yield and cost management. The improvement in Other EBITDA is principally due to asset sales and the positive impact of higher discount rates on some balance sheet provisions.\n\nRevenue increased 2% with Bulk and Coal growth (including the impact of higher fuel prices) more than o/ffsetting lower revenue in Network.\n\nOperating costs increased $70.6m or 5% with increases in all business units due to increased volumes and one-o/ff costs in Bulk and higher fuel and energy costs (largely pass-through costs) more than o/ffsetting transformation benefits.\n\nDepreciation increased $13.2m or 2% primarily due to capital expenditure in Bulk to support growth and increased ballast and rail renewals in Network. With the increase in depreciation, EBIT declined $27.8m or 3%.\n\nROIC was 0.4ppts lower to 10.3% due to the decreased EBIT and slightly higher invested capital.\n\n## Reconciliation to statutory earnings\n\nUnderlying earnings is a non-statutory measure and is the primary reporting measure used by management and the Group's chief operating decisionmaking bodies for managing and assessing the financial performance of the business. Underlying earnings is derived by adjusting statutory earnings for significant items as noted in the following table:\n\n| ($M)                                                     | FY2022   | FY2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Continuing operations                                    |          |          |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                        | 1,467.6  | 1,482.2  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                            | (592.3)  | (579.1)  |\n| Underlying EBIT                                          | 875.3    | 903.1    |\n| Significant items                                        | (14.2)   | 8.2      |\n| Transaction costs incurred for ORA                       | (14.2)   | -        |\n| Net gain on sale of shares in Aquila                     | -        | 8.2      |\n| Statutory EBIT                                           | 861.1    | 911.3    |\n| Net finance costs                                        | (125.0)  | (145.3)  |\n| Statutory Profit before tax                              | 736.1    | 766.0    |\n| Income tax expense                                       | (223.1)  | (159.3)  |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing operations                   | 513.0    | 606.7    |\n| Significant items, net of tax 5                          | (11.9)   | 5.7      |\n| Significant items - Aquila income tax benefit            | -        | 67.8     |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing operations                  | 524.9    | 533.2    |\n| Discontinued operations                                  |          |          |\n| Underlying EBIT                                          | -        | 14.9     |\n| Significant items                                        | -        | 161.1    |\n| Net gain on sale of Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal     | -        | 161.1    |\n| Income tax expense                                       | -        | (52.4)   |\n| Statutory NPAT - Discontinued operations                 | -        | 123.6    |\n| Significant items, net of tax                            | -        | 112.8    |\n| Underlying NPAT - Discontinued operations                | -        | 10.8     |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations  | 513.0    | 730.3    |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations | 524.9    | 544.0    |",

Network Take-or-Pay revenue of $77.5m from the prior year also contributed to cash inflows given this revenue was collected in FY2022. This was partly o/ffset by a reduction in EBITDA and working capital, which was mainly due to an increase in inventory and reduction in provisions.\n\nNet cash outflow from investing activities from continuing operations decreased by $4.7m (1%) to $528.4m, due to lower payments for acquisitions than in FY2021 partly o/ffset by an increase in payments for property, plant and equipment and intangibles.\n\nNet cash outflow from financing activities from continuing operations reduced by $2.5m to $767.8m.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations increased $75.0m or 13%.",

With this One Rail debt now drawn to enable the acquisition, the focus for FY2023 will be on terming this debt out in capital markets.\n\nIn respect of FY2022:\n\n- \u203a Weighted average debt maturity tenor was 3.4 years as at 30 June 2022 which compares to 4.4 years in FY2021\n- \u203a Group interest cost on drawn debt was 3.4% (FY2021: 4.1%)\n- \u203a Available liquidity (undrawn facilities + cash) as at 30 June 2022 was $1,622.1m (FY2021: $1,618.2m)\n- \u203a Group gearing (net debt/(net debt + equity)) as at 30 June 2022 was 40.9% (FY2021: 45.6%)\n- \u203a Aurizon Network's gearing (net debt/ Regulatory Asset Base (excluding Access Facilitation Deeds)) as at 30 June 2022 was 53.7% (FY2021: 60.8%)\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations' gearing (net debt/(net debt + equity)) as at 30 June 2022 was 5.6% (FY2021: 10.5%)\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations' and Aurizon Network's credit ratings have each been maintained at BBB+/Baa1\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations expanded the number of lenders by three to 15 banks.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board has declared a final dividend for FY2022 of 10.9cps (100% franked) based on a payout ratio of 75% in respect of underlying NPAT from continuing operations.\n\nThe relevant final dividend dates are:\n\n- \u203a 22 August 2022 - ex-dividend date\n- \u203a 23 August 2022 - record date\n- \u203a 21 September 2022 - payment date.\n\n## Tax\n\nUnderlying income tax expense for FY2022 was $225.3m and the underlying e/ffective tax rate 7 was 30%. Statutory income tax expense was similar at $223.1m, resulting in a statutory e/ffective tax rate of 30.3%.\n\nThe FY2022 underlying cash tax rate 8 was 22.2%, which is less than 30% primarily due to accelerated fixed asset related adjustments.\n\nExcluding the impact from ORA earnings, the underlying e/ffective tax rate for FY2023 is expected to be in the range of 29-31% and the underlying cash tax rate is expected to be less than 28% for the short to medium term.\n\nAurizon publishes additional tax information in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code in its Sustainability Report. See the Sustainability section of the Aurizon website for further detail.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nThe Group completed the sale of the Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal to Pacific National on 26 March 2021.",

Aurizon hauls around half of Australia's export coal volume. Coal hauled is split approximately evenly between metallurgical coal and thermal coal, with demand linked to Asian steel production and energy generation, respectively.\n\nAurizon transports coal from mines in the Newlands, Goonyella, Blackwater, Moura and West Moreton systems in Queensland (QLD) and the Hunter Valley and Illawarra coal systems in New South Wales (NSW) to domestic customers and coal export terminals.\n\n## FINANCIAL SUMMARY\n\n| ($M)                          | FY2022   | FY2021   | VARIANCE   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Revenue                       |          |          |            |\n| Above Rail 10                 | 1,195.1  | 1,179.9  | 1%         |\n| Track access 10               | 359.7    | 428.8    | (16%)      |\n| Other                         | 4.7      | 3.4      | 38%        |\n| Total revenue                 | 1,559.5  | 1,612.1  | (3%)       |\n| Track access costs            | (376.2)  | (451.0)  | 17%        |\n| Operating costs               | (642.1)  | (627.8)  | (2%)       |\n| EBITDA                        | 541.2    | 533.3    | 1%         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (208.7)  | (208.7)  | -          |\n| EBIT                          | 332.5    | 324.6    | 2%         |\n\n## METRICS\n\n|                                                          | FY2022   | FY2021   | VARIANCE   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Total tonnes hauled (m)                                  | 194.0    | 202.1    | (4%)       |\n| CQCN                                                     | 141.1    | 143.7    | (2%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                | 52.9     | 58.4     | (9%)       |\n| Contract utilisation                                     | 84%      | 83%      | 1ppt       |\n| Total NTK (bn)                                           | 45.2     | 47.1     | (4%)       |\n| CQCN                                                     | 35.3     | 35.8     | (1%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                | 9.9      | 11.3     | (12%)      |\n| Average haul length (km)                                 | 233      | 233      | -          |\n| Total revenue/NTK ($/'000 NTK)                           | 34.5     | 34.2     | 1%         |\n| Above Rail Revenue/NTK ($/'000 NTK) 10                   | 26.4     | 25.1     | 5%         |\n| Operating Ratio (%)                                      | 78.7%    | 79.9%    | 1.2ppt     |\n| Opex/NTK ($/'000 NTK)                                    | 27.1     | 27.3     | 1%         |\n| Opex/NTK (excluding access costs) ($/'000 NTK)           | 18.8     | 17.8     | (6%)       |\n| Locomotive productivity ('000 NTK/Active locomotive day) | 389.1    | 390.5    | -          |\n| Active locomotives (as at 30 June)                       | 314      | 329      | (5%)       |\n| Wagon productivity ('000 NTK/Active wagon day)           | 14.7     | 14.9     | (1%)       |\n| Active wagons (as at 30 June)                            | 8,285    | 8,723    | (5%)       |\n| Payload (tonnes)                                         | 7,938    | 7,887    | 1%         |\n\n- 9  Australian Bureau of Statistics (FY2022).\n- 10 $16.3 million has been reclassified from access revenue to above rail revenue for FY2021 for consistency with current year presentation.",

        "page_content": "## Coal performance overview\n\nCoal EBITDA increased $7.9m (1%) to $541.2m primarily due to higher above rail revenue relating to improved revenue quality and fuel revenue in addition to lower track access, traincrew and maintenance costs. This was partly o/ffset by lower volumes, lower track access revenue and higher fuel costs.\n\nVolumes decreased 8.1mt or 4% to 194.0mt with reductions across NSW, South-East Queensland (SEQ) and the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN).\n\n- \u203a In NSW and SEQ, volumes decreased by 5.5mt (9%) to 52.9mt due to the cessation of the New Acland and Moolarben contracts, weather impacts, customer maintenance and production issues and COVID-19 impacts. This was partly o/ffset by higher railings in the Illawarra corridor.\n- \u203a Across the CQCN, volumes decreased by 2.6mt (2%) to 141.1mt due to customer production which saw mines impacted by weather and labour challenges as a result of COVID-19.\n\nCoal revenue decreased by $52.6m (3%) to $1,559.5m with an 8.1mt reduction in volumes and lower track access revenue partly o/ffset by improved revenue quality, including CPI favourably impacting contract rates, and higher fuel revenue (price related). Track access revenue decreased with additional volumes moving to end user agreements, lower overall volumes, contract expiry and prior year Take-or-Pay impacts. Above rail revenue per NTK increased by 5% due to CPI benefits, higher fuel revenue and customer mix changes towards higher yielding customers against prior comparative period.\n\nTotal operating costs decreased $60.5m (6%) to $1,018.3m with lower track access, traincrew and maintenance costs partly o/ffset by higher fuel costs. The major drivers of these movements are:\n\n- \u203a Track access costs decreased by $74.8m (17%) due to additional volume moving to end user agreements, lower overall volumes, prior year Take-or-Pay expense and expiry of contracts.\n- \u203a Other operating costs increased $14.3m (2%) largely due to higher fuel partly o/ffset by lower traincrew and maintenance costs. Traincrew costs reduced due to lower FTEs relating to the end-of-contract impacts, partly o/ffset by increased CPI and higher overtime and leave impacts due to COVID-19. Maintenance costs declined with lower active locomotives and wagons due to lower volumes and transformation activities, partly o/ffset by CPI impacts.\n\nDepreciation remained flat, resulting in a 2% increase to EBIT against a 1% increase in EBITDA.\n\nOperationally, key productivity metrics deteriorated against the prior comparative period with lower volumes and NTKs. Active locomotives decreased with contracted volume reduction and transfers to Bulk to support growth opportunities. Average payloads increased due to change in volume mix relating to lower SEQ volumes which have a lower payload.\n\n## Market update\n\nAustralia exported 359mt of coal in FY2022, down 1% against the prior year as volumes were impacted by adverse weather and COVID-19 related labour constraints.\n\nAustralia exported 162mt of metallurgical coal in FY2022, down 5% against the prior year. India remained Australia's largest metallurgical coal export market with export volume of 49mt (30% share), followed by Japan at 38mt (24% share) and South Korea at 24mt (15% share). In FY2022, Global crude steel production decreased 5% against the prior year, whilst India and Japan's crude steel output increased 8% and 6% respectively. The average hard coking coal (Premium Low Vol) price in FY2022 increased by 222% (compared to the prior year) to US$391/t primarily driven by supply constraints. At 29 July 2022, the hard coking coal (Premium Low Vol) price was US$191/t.\n\nAustralia exported 197mt of thermal coal in FY2022, up 2% against the prior year. Japan remained Australia's largest thermal coal export market with export volume of 86mt (44% share), followed by South Korea at 36mt (18% share) and Taiwan at 27mt (14% share). The average Newcastle benchmark thermal coal price in FY2022 increased by 216% (compared to the prior year) to US$246/t. At 29 July 2022, the thermal coal price was US$404/t.\n\n## Contract update\n\n- \u203a Stanmore - Aurizon remains the primary Goonyella system hauler for South Walker Creek and Poitrel mines following on from Stanmore's acquisition of the BHP Mitsui Coal assets.\n- \u203a Pembroke - Aurizon has secured a long-term haulage agreement with Pembroke Resources, expected to commence haulage late CY2023 at the new Olive Down Complex located in the Goonyella system.\n- \u203a Baralaba - Aurizon has secured a five-year extension to the haulage agreement with Baralaba Coal in the Moura System.\n- \u203a New Hope  - New Acland contract ended December 2021 (end of mine life).\n- \u203a Yancoal - Moolarben contract ended December 2021.",

Revenue increased $56.4m (9%) to $691.2m with:\n\n- \u203a The commencement of the CBH Grain contract in Western Australia (WA) in 1HFY2022\n- \u203a Stronger grain volumes in both QLD and NSW compared to the prior comparative period\n- \u203a The commencement of a long-term haulage contract with Tronox in 2HFY2022\n- \u203a The acquisition of ConPorts Pty Ltd (renamed Aurizon Port Services NSW Pty Ltd) on 31 December 2020\n- \u203a Higher fuel prices in FY2022 compared to the prior comparative period\n- \u203a Marginal revenue yield improvements including CPI increases.\n\nPartly o/ffsetting this was lower iron ore volumes and the loss of the QLD livestock contract in 2HFY2022 and BHP Nickel West in 2HFY2021. In addition, there was a major scheduled planned maintenance for IPL on the Mt Isa Line in 2HFY2022.\n\nIn Bulk East, volumes increased by 0.3mt driven by stronger grain volumes in NSW and QLD, partly o/ffset by lower livestock volumes. In Bulk West, iron ore volume was down 3.2mt driven by the cessation of Mt Gibson volumes in December 2020 and lower MRL volumes into Esperance. Non-iron ore Bulk West volumes increased by 2.6mt due to the ramp up of CBH grain volumes partly o/ffset by lower BHP Nickel West volumes and Alcoa volumes due to the ceasing of export bauxite.\n\nOperating costs increased $66.2m (13%) with:\n\n- \u203a Increased costs to support contract wins predominately in grain (including ramp up costs for both traincrew, rollingstock a nd facilities)\n- \u203a The acquisition of ConPorts Pty Ltd (renamed Aurizon Port Services NSW Pty Ltd) on 31 December 2020\n- \u203a Significantly higher fuel prices in FY2022 compared to the prior comparative period\n- \u203a A major derailment on the North Coast Line in QLD in 2HFY2022\n- \u203a Partly o/ffset by ongoing cost benefits from the Bulk transformation program and lower costs from the loss of BHP Nickel West.\n\nDepreciation increased $8.8m or 32% with increased capital expenditure supporting the growth in the Bulk business. Therefore, EBIT decreased 17% compared to a 7% decrease in EBITDA.\n\n## Market update\n\nDemand for bulk commodities is projected to continue to be driven by infrastructure development in addition to opportunities from new economy markets and increasing global food consumption.\n\n- \u203a During the March 2022 quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that nickel (including cobalt) exploration expenditure in Australia rose by 37% (compared to the same period of the prior year) and copper exploration expenditure increased by 12% across the same period. Australian metal ore mining capital expenditure increased in the March 2022 quarter by 10% against the prior comparative period to A$4.9b, the 18th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for the sector.\n- \u203a In June 2022, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) has projected Australian export volume for major crops of wheat, barley and canola, with a record combined total of 39.6mt for the 2021-22 season. Strong volumes are expected to continue into the 2022-23 season, with the ABARES forecasting 35.3mt, the fourth highest year on record.\n\n## Contract update\n\n- \u203a CBH - 10-year 11 grain haulage contract commenced October 2021\n- \u203a Alcoa - five-year contract extension for alumina and associated inputs\n- \u203a Lynas - five-year contract for WA operations including new facility currently under construction\n- \u203a Tronox - five plus five-year term executed for the transport of mineral sands concentrate from Broken Hill region\n- \u203a Queensland Government (Department of Transport and Main Roads) - loss of Livestock contract in QLD from December 2021.",

Actual net tonnes were 206.5mt compared to the regulatory system forecast of 226.9mt. Total Access Revenue in FY2022 reduced by $45.2m (4%) compared to FY2021:\n\n- \u203a Allowable Revenue was lower by $11.2m in FY2022 primarily due to capital underspends in FY2019 and FY2020\n- \u203a Reduced volumes compared to the regulatory forecast resulted in an underrecovery (excluding GAPE) after Take-or-Pay of $39.0m in FY2022 (Access Revenue in FY2022 included the recognition of $32.8m Take-or-Pay revenue). This compares to an under-recovery of $34.6m (including $88.2m of Take-or-Pay) in FY2021.\n\n- \u203a Network settled all disputes with WIRP customers under their respective WIRP Deeds in July 2022. WIRP fees of $47.0m, including $30.3m of historical fees relating to FY2016 - FY2021, have been recognised in FY2022 (FY2021: $60.3m, including $48.9m of historical fees).\n- \u203a GAPE revenue was $20.0m lower primarily due to the risk-free rate reset in June 2021 and the inclusion of a Transfer Fee in FY2021.\n- \u203a The above movements were partly o/ffset by higher Other Access revenue of $3.7m.\n\nServices and other revenue were $13.2m (29%) higher in FY2022. This was primarily due to higher construction revenue in FY2022 and is partly o/ffset in higher operating costs.\n\nOperating costs increased by $15.5m (4%) primarily due to higher construction costs associated with the higher revenue, increased electric traction charges and higher maintenance costs.\n\nDepreciation increased $5.1m (2%) primarily due to ongoing rail renewal, plant and ballast undercutting investment.\n\nThe Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) roll-forward is estimated to be $5.4bn 12 (excluding Access Facilitation Deeds of $0.3bn) as at 1 July 2022.\n\n## Regulation update\n\nNetwork continues to progress the implementation of the 2017 Access Undertaking (UT5) which was approved by the QCA on 19 December 2019. The status of key aspects of UT5 are:\n\n- \u203a The QCA published the Independent Expert's (IE) Initial Capacity Assessment Report (ICAR) on 1 November 2021. The ICAR identified that the average annual deliverable network capacity of each coal system in the CQCN for the period FY2022 - FY2024, when measured as a percentage of the current contracted capacity for each coal system, is estimated as follows:\n- \u00b7  Goonyella: ~93%\n- \u00b7  Blackwater System: ~96%\n- \u00b7  GAPE System: ~64%\n- \u00b7  Moura System: ~93%\n- \u00b7  Newlands System: ~66%.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n- \u203a On 12 November 2021, Network provided the Chair of the Rail Industry Group (RIG) and the QCA its preliminary response to the ICAR, which set out the proposed options to address the capacity deficits identified in each coal system by the IE in the ICAR.\n- \u203a Consistent with the definition of the term 'Report Date' in UT5, this notification to the Chair of the RIG on 12 November 2021 triggered an increase in Network's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) from 5.9% to 6.3%. The QCA-approved reference tari/ffs assumed 6.3% WACC from 1 March 2020. As a result of the delay in the ICAR, there has been an over-collection of access charges (the di/fference between 5.9% and 6.3%) in FY2022 of $9.3m. This will be included in the FY2022 revenue adjustment amount and recovered in the FY2024 tari/ffs.\n- \u203a On 14 March 2022, Network provided its detailed report in response to the ICAR to the QCA and the Chair of the RIG, outlining a program of works to rectify the relevant coal systems' capacity deficits. Network's response also included a proposal to allow for both Network and the IE to recommend that a further expansion study be completed where there are one or more alternative expansions that could assist in resolving the relevant capacity deficit. As the current approved form of UT5 does not allow for such further studies, Network submitted a Draft Amending Access Undertaking (DAAU) on 8 June 2022 for QCA approval.\n- \u203a The QCA published the IE's Annual Capacity Assessment Report 2022 (ACAR) on 23 June 2022. The ACAR identified some di/fferences between it and the findings in the ICAR in relation to the average annual deliverable network capacity of each coal system for the period FY2022 - FY2024, when measured as a percentage of the current contracted capacity for each coal system, which are as follows:\n- \u00b7  Goonyella System has improved by ~2% to ~93 - 95%;\n- \u00b7  Blackwater System has improved by ~2-4% and is forecast to be at ~100% in FY2026;\n- \u00b7  GAPE System is slightly lower for FY2023 and FY2024 then at similar levels for other years;\n- \u00b7  Moura System has improved by ~7% to ~99%; and\n- \u00b7  Newlands System is lower in FY2023 compared to the ICAR, however similar for other years.\n\n- \u203a As required under UT5, on 17 June 2022, the IE made a recommendation to the QCA on which of the Transitional Arrangements identified in Network's Detailed Report would most e/ffectively and e/fficiently resolve the deficits identified in the ICAR, following which the QCA will make a decision. The QCA has not made such a determination yet and therefore the impact of any such determination has not been assessed.\n- \u203a The Performance Rebate mechanism in UT5 came into e/ffect on 12 November 2021. The Performance Rebate is payable if an End User does not receive its contracted Train Service Entitlement for the period 12 November 2021 until 30 June 2022 due to a performance breach by Network as determined by the IE under UT5, with certain permitted exclusions. Any transitional arrangements that are implemented to rectify an Existing Capacity Deficit will be taken into consideration in the calculation of the Performance Rebate. The FY2022 Performance Rebate is currently being considered by the IE.\n- \u203a On 8 June 2022, Network submitted to the QCA a DAAU to adjust the Electric Energy Charge (EC) under UT5 for FY2023. Due to the significant increase and forecast volatility in the wholesale electricity rates, it was necessary to submit the DAAU to adjust the EC tari/ff from $1.11 to $2.82 per eGTK. A QCA decision on the DAAU is expected in Q1 FY2023. Recognising the current price volatility in the electricity market, Aurizon Network has made a commitment to review and if required, submit a further update to the FY2023 EC Tari/ff and other regulatory inputs including coal volumes to the QCA no later than Q4 of FY2023 via a further DAAU.\n- \u203a UT5 provides for certain variable components of WACC (predominately risk-free rate, debt risk premium, inflation and the tax allowance) (Reset Values) to be reset on 1 July 2023 to take account of prevailing market conditions at that time. The two-stage process will involve preliminary Reset Values submitted to the QCA for consultation in July 2022 which will inform FY2024 tari/ffs and final Reset Values agreed in July 2023 which will apply from 1 July 2024. Any variation between final Reset Values and preliminary Reset Values will be included in FY2026 Revenue Adjustment Amounts.\n\n## Operational update\n\nNetwork maintained strong operational performance during FY2022:\n\n- \u203a CQCN volumes declined by 1% to 206.5mt. The volume reductions were largely attributable to wet weather, mine specific maintenance and production issues as well as COVID-19 related restrictions and disruptions\n- \u203a Total System Availability was 82.6% compared to 84.1% in the PCP\n- \u203a Cancellations due to the Network rail infrastructure increased from 1.6%. to 2.1%\n- \u203a Cycle velocity declined marginally from 23.0km/h to 22.8km/h.\n\n## Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP)\n\nNetwork settled all disputes with WIRP customers under their respective WIRP Deeds in July 2022. WIRP fees of $47.0m, including $30.3m of historical fees relating to FY2016FY2021, have been recognised in FY2022 (FY2021: $60.3m, including $48.9m of historical fees).",

Through the Optimise and Excel levers, Aurizon is making targeted investments in technology on the journey to continuous improvement. Project Precision is transitioned to business as usual in FY2022 with accountability now embedded in the Network Planning and Scheduling function.\n\nOutlined below are the major initiatives currently being pursued in the business.\n\n## Automated Track Inspection System (ATIS)\n\nThe ATIS initiative seeks to measure track and overhead line alignment via locomotive-mounted equipment using lasers to achieve precise measurements at line speed. ATIS is a collection of systems including a Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS), a Wire Geometry Measurement System (WGMS) and a Pantograph Collision Detection System (PCDS). Network currently uses a track-recording car to obtain these measurements, with the service provided by a third party which consumes train paths that would otherwise be used by revenue train services.\n\nIt is intended that ATIS will enable an increase in the timeliness of data allowing a move to a condition-based track resurfacing scope, tracking of defects and the ability to trend degradation to predict future fail points or intervention triggers. Other benefits of ATIS may include reduced cost and improved access by removing the requirement to utilise the trackrecording car.\n\nDuring FY2022 Network successfully trialled and completed verification reporting of the WGMS and PCDS systems confirming that overhead wire alignment information can also be captured via automated means.\n\nFollowing the successful trials and support from our customers, the ATIS initiative will be implemented across the CQCN in FY2023.\n\n## TrainGuard\n\nTrainGuard is a platform utilising ETCS (European Train Control System) technology to support driver decision-making, particularly in relation to speed control and signal enforcement. TrainGuard will support safer and more e/fficient train operations with reduced rail process safety issues and improved train handling. TrainGuard is also a pathway to expanding our driver-only operations in Central Queensland. Site integration testing of TrainGuard was successfully completed in July 2022. The project is scheduled to deploy the technology on the Blackwater mainline (Callemondah to Blu/ff) in FY2023 with work in the Goonyella system to follow.\n\n## Asset maintenance\n\nAbove Rail Asset Management (ARAM) is a multi-year transformation project and has progressed with the dedicated project team for a third year working in close collaboration with various business stakeholders. The program of work has matured Aurizon supply chain and vendor management processes, standardised planning processes across the business, improved depot work execution e/fficiency, and is now transitioning Aurizon's major rollingstock fleets from simple time-based to more mature condition-based maintenance strategies.\n\nFY2022 has seen the successful implementation of more mature maintenance strategies across three of four major rollingstock fleets and will allow the business to continue on the maintenance maturity journey. These strategies contributed to maintenance cost reductions in the Coal business in FY2022. The project drew to a close at the end of FY2022 and sustainable business-as-usual (BAU) plans have been put in place. The value created will continue into future years, delivering sustained and further optimisation of the maintenance life cycle for Aurizon's rollingstock.\n\n## TrainHealth\n\nTrainHealth provides Aurizon with capability to monitor performance of locomotives and train handling/utilisation in real-time. This initiative enables access to real-time asset data that is being used to inform the health of the locomotive, enhance asset reliability and maintenance decisions for the fleet, in addition to providing greater visibility on driver variability and support business decisions for on-time running. With installation completed for the CQCN Siemens electric locomotive fleet, installation across the CQCN diesel is scheduled for completion during FY2023.",

The consideration of risk features heavily in our thinking, from the framing of strategy through to informing decision-making at the front line. Our Enterprise Risk team, together with all leaders in the business, closely monitors the environment in which we operate to enable the business to understand and proactively manage key risk exposures and situational developments.\n\nThe Board-approved Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Appetite encompasses a broad range of risks, enabling continuous consideration and strategy development to manage the full scope of risks faced by our business. Risk reporting provided both to our Board and supporting Committees facilitates the early identification and proactive management of emerging risks, where the impacts and opportunities are continually evolving. Risk management procedures and templates deployed throughout the business further integrate the assessment of safety and non-safety risks and support a consistent approach to comprehensive, proportionate and e/ffective risk management.\n\nAurizon's Enterprise Risk Profile is actively managed and regularly reported to the Board. It includes both those material inherent risks related to the enduring nature of Aurizon's business and also those that present an exposure linked to the changing operating landscape or point-in-time external factors.\n\nThese risks have been grouped around three/uni00A0themes of operational, market and strategic risk. The commentary has been provided to describe and summarise each key risk, the nature of the potential impacts to Aurizon, our view on our ability to influence the risk and consequences being realised, and a description of management's response to that risk. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks that the business is or could be exposed to.\n\nIt represents Aurizon's own assessment of these risks at a point in time and, given the complexities and nature of these risks, this information is subjective and may be subject to change.

Aurizon's safety risk exposure is impacted by the  diversity and scale of its operations - from train  operations, on-track works, ports and heavy vehicle  haulage. Incidents could include: \u203a Process Safety Incident - major process safety  event leading to death or injuries to our people  \u203a Road Vehicle Incident - death or injuries to our  people from operating road vehicles  \u203a Trespass - safety risks to employees and individuals  due to persons illegally entering the rail corridor                                                                                          | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | Aurizon's commitment to keeping   people safe and healthy is a priority.   Our safety value 'We know safe,   we choose safe' promotes leadership   and personal accountability for safety. Aurizon's leadership team and Board  regularly review safety performance,  improvement strategies and activities  across the business, aligned to a defined  enterprise safety strategy.

Malicious attacks resulting in  business interruptions, nationally and internationally,  are increasing. Aurizon relies on technology and is  exposed to cyber-related risks which can arise through  a multitude of vectors including malicious external  hackers, insider threats, unintentional human error or  through links to third parties. A cyber breach or other technology-related disruption  could impact Aurizon's operations and impair its ability  to provide services. Such an event could potentially  result in financial losses, reputational damage, legal or  regulatory action or other adverse consequences. Aurizon owns and maintains rail track infrastructure | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | Cyber security controls including  identification, prevention, detection and  recovery controls are in place and are  tested regularly. Policies, frameworks,  tools and training to ensure baseline  expectations for the management of  cyber risks are understood and adhered to. Aurizon participates in cross-industry  collaboration and provides the threat  intelligence required to improve defences  based on emerging threats and real-time  incident data. Aurizon has developed a cyber security  investment roadmap to continue to  enhance its protective cyber security  capabilities in a targeted manner that will  prioritise those assets most critical to the  business to increase resilience. |\n| Severe Weather                               | in addition to other rail assets, maintenance facilities,  rail depots and worksites across Australia. Maintaining  a large physical footprint exposes Aurizon to risks  caused by the increasing severity and prolonged nature  of extreme weather events, such as flooding, bushfires,  heatwaves and cyclones.  Damage caused by destructive weather events  could cause safety, health and environmental risks,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | Incident management and business  continuity planning, protocols and  expertise are essential to manage a  safe and e/ffective response to severe  weather events.

There is a risk                                                                   | INFLUENCE SIGNIFICANT LIMITED           | Aurizon has commenced a dual track  process for the divestment, to be  completed via a trade sale or demerger.  Until divestment, ECR will be held and  operated separately to Aurizon, with an  independent Board and management  and an Independent Manager approved  by the ACCC. |\n| One Rail Australia -  Integration                          | Aurizon's ability to generate value from the acquisition  of One Rail is dependent on the successful integration  of One Rail into Aurizon's Bulk business unit. Aurizon faces the risk that it fails to e/ffectively  integrate One Rail and to achieve the underlying                                                                                                                      | SIGNIFICANT LIMITED                     | management and reporting. An integration project team has  been established and provided with  appropriate resources to ensure e/ffective  integration and longer-term value  generation for the Bulk business unit.                                                                 |\n| Fleet Strategy                                             | Aurizon's ability to e/ffectively serve its customers  is largely dependent on its ability to make optimal  use of its long-life operational assets.

Investors can access copies of announcements to the ASX, notices of meetings, annual reports, policies, investor presentations, webcasts, and transcripts of those presentations on our website.\n\nIn addition to the above disclosures, we take a direct approach to reporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures to our stakeholders with the publication of our annual Sustainability Report.\n\nWe recognise that our climate change disclosures are one of the key areas of interest to stakeholders. Since 2017, we have aligned our climate-related disclosures to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as recommended by the Financial Stability Board. This framework enables consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders.\n\nIn June 2022, we received a 'Comprehensive' rating, the highest rating for an eighth consecutive year by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) for corporate sustainability reporting in Australia.\n\n## Safety\n\nAt Aurizon, we are committed to protecting ourselves, each other, and our communities. We are determined to focus on managing what matters, with a specific focus on identifying and learning from events that have the potential for Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF).\n\nIn FY2022, the primary safety metrics to measure safety performance across the enterprise were Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Rail Process Safety (RPS).\n\nImportantly, none of our people were seriously or fatally injured while at work.\n\nTRIFR was 8.41 injuries per million hours worked, which was an 18% improvement against the prior comparative period. Several injury prevention and management initiatives to reduce the frequency of low severity injuries were implemented in FY2022. There is ongoing support to embed Telehealth and proactive intervention strategies to ensure our people are provided support whenever it is needed.\n\nRail Process Safety, which measures operational rail safety, including derailments, signals passed at danger, and rollingstock collisions (expressed per million train kilometres) improved by 17% against the prior comparative period to 4.24. Aurizon continues to progress several strategic initiatives, including a community of practice focused on improving yard safety interfaces to reduce the number of yard incidents. RPS as a consolidated frequency rate measure will no longer be reported internally or externally after FY2022. Instead, the sub-component parts will continue to be managed and monitored by management and operational leaders.\n\nIn FY2023, Aurizon is changing its key operational safety metrics as foreshadowed in our half-year results by removing RPS and replacing it with SIF Rate, including both actual and potential events (SIFR(a+p)). The measure change is important for Aurizon as it recognises our significant growth journey and operational diversification. While SIF actual and potential events have been internally reported, in FY2023 we will now be monitoring the rate of SIF actual and potential events across our operation, per million hours worked. Unlike RPS, SIFR(a+p) captures our full breadth of activities across ports, terminals, road transport, and broader infrastructure activities. As such, it will help direct our e/fforts to preventing serious injury events across all of Aurizon's operations.\n\nDuring FY2022, we have continued to embed our Safety Strategy through nine key priorities focused on building and implementing simple systems and processes, understanding and controlling safety hazards and risks, and building leadership capability with a strong in-field presence.",

We employ proactive and evidence-based management measures covering key environmental issues such as climate change, resource use and clean air.\n\nIn FY2022, Aurizon contributed to the development of Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board's (RISSB) Train Horn Use Code of Practice (CoP). The CoP seeks to minimise horn use impacts on the community whilst maintaining safe operations, through standardisation of network rules and improved driver awareness.\n\nAurizon continues to work collaboratively with supply chain partners to minimise coal dust emissions associated with Aurizon's coal haulage operations. Data from the CQCN opacity monitoring stations indicated FY2022 continued to yield low rates of coal dust loss from tops of wagons well below the long-term average. For further detail in relation to coal dust management and monitoring processes, refer to Aurizon's annual Sustainability Report.\n\nAurizon successfully transitioned its Safeguard Mechanism Facilities (covering Scope 1 GHG emissions associated with rail activities in QLD and WA) from reported safeguard baselines to production-adjusted safeguard baselines. To date, Aurizon has not been required to purchase or retire Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to meet its obligations under the safeguard mechanism. This has been achieved through e/ffective management of its scope 1 emissions intensity to remain below baselines.\n\nIn FY2022, Aurizon launched its Cultural Heritage Governance Framework (CHGF). Leading the CHGF is a Commitment Statement which is ' to minimise our impact on Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural heritage through a framework founded on knowledge, understanding and respect .' The CHGF provides an implementation framework, specifying jurisdictional requirements, articulating responsibilities, accountabilities, and providing direction to bespoke guidelines and procedures. The CHGF is supported by a Cultural Heritage Awareness learning package available to all Aurizon employees.\n\n## In FY2022:\n\n- \u203a Aurizon did not incur any fines, penalties or prosecutions arising from environmental or cultural heritage related incidents; and\n- \u203a Aurizon had three notifiable environmental incidents. Remedial actions were implemented as required and no ongoing material environmental impacts are anticipated.\n\n## People\n\nAt Aurizon, our people are our greatest asset. We have over 5,000 employees, with more than 85% living and working in regional Australia, including more than 20% of our senior management. Our Aurizon values (Safety, People, Integrity, Customer and Excellence) guide our people's work, in delivering bulk commodities to the world, and are underpinned by a workplace culture of connection to enable great outcomes.\n\nThrough our commitment to safe and e/fficient delivery for our customers, we are building our workforce for the future. Strong leadership, culture and values-aligned people practices lay the foundation to achieve this. During the year we progressed key initiatives, including:\n\n- \u203a embedding our three core Leadership programs designed to embed a safe and high performing culture where our people live our values and are engaged and enabled to do their best work\n- \u203a supporting development at all levels, with targeted capability programs and a new, self-paced learning platform\n- \u203a further improvements to our people, processes and systems with a focus on our annual performance, talent and succession process facilitating the development of our internal talent pool. This engages and retains valued employees, and their knowledge, while reducing external recruitment costs and ensures we maintain our focus on our current and future capability requirements\n- \u203a continuing to strive towards creating an inclusive culture by embedding flexible work practices, creating awareness and driving action for inclusion through employee representative groups (across gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and LGBTQIA+ inclusion), meeting workforce representation targets and actively reducing the gender pay gap.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nOn behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present Aurizon's Financial Year (FY) 2022 Remuneration Report. The Board believes that the Company has performed well and wishes to recognise the Leadership Team's performance in executing our business strategy and for achieving key milestones during the year. The Board would also like to thank all employees for their commitment and contributions throughout the year.\n\nAurizon delivered Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in FY2022 of $1,468 million. This was a solid result given the uncertain business environment during the period, including major flooding events on the East Coast of Australia and ongoing COVID-19 related impacts on production for many of our customers. Aurizon's ability to deliver within guidance demonstrates the resilience of our Company, with strong operating discipline and revenue protection mechanisms in place, and the ongoing e/fforts and dedication of our employees during a challenging time.\n\nDespite 4% lower volumes in FY2022, the Coal business recorded higher Underlying EBITDA of $541 million, which represented a 1% increase compared to FY2021.\n\nThe Network business achieved an Underlying EBITDA of $801 million, down 6% compared to FY2021. Revenue reduced by 3%, with volumes in FY2022 lower than the regulatory forecast resulting in an under-recovery of revenue.\n\nThe Bulk business recorded an Underlying EBITDA of $130 million which was down 7% compared to the prior period. This was the result of lower volumes, due to the end of contracts for Mt Gibson and Queensland livestock and one-o/ff factors such as stand-up costs associated with new contracts, weather and an extended shut-down by a major customer which more than o/ffset 7% revenue growth. After year end, in July 2022, we were pleased to announce that Aurizon had received the regulatory approval to progress with the acquisition of One Rail Australia. This is a significant outcome for Aurizon and a great opportunity to grow and expand our service o/ffering. Delivering on the growth from this acquisition and integration synergies will be a key focus for management with targets being built into management scorecards to drive outcomes for shareholders.\n\nThe Short Term Incentive (STI) Award for FY2022 continued to be based on annual performance measures of Underlying EBITDA, Safety and Individual Key Deliverables. Business Unit earnings metrics also continue to be used for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nIn FY2022, Group Underlying EBITDA achieved a Target performance with Underlying EBITDA outcomes varying across the Business Units. Network achieved an Underlying EBITDA outcome above Target, Coal achieved an outcome just below Target performance while Bulk was below Threshold.\n\nAt Aurizon, we are committed to protecting ourselves, each other and our communities. In FY2022, we retained two primary safety metrics to measure safety outcomes across the enterprise including Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Rail Process Safety (RPS), which measures operational safety including derailments, signals passed at danger and rollingstock collisions. There has been a significant improvement in both TRIFR (17.6% improvement) and RPS (17.3% improvement) against the prior year with both metrics achieving Stretch performance for FY2022.\n\nThe STI Award also considers performance against individual objectives which vary for Key Management Personnel (KMP). Throughout the year progress has been made against key transformation initiatives to improve e/fficiency and competitiveness, continue growth plans within the Bulk contract book including capital optimisation and fleet cascading to support this growth, continuing with inorganic growth plans and continued improvement of safety and performance culture.\n\nThrough Aurizon's Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP), which forms part of Executive performance deliverables, we continue to focus on specific initiatives to build resilience, manage risk, leverage opportunities and decarbonise our operations. During FY2022, we have continued to progress our fleet decarbonisation program, which is supported by a multi-year research program and industry partnerships. Aurizon and Anglo American entered into an agreement to conduct a feasibility study exploring the application of Anglo American's proprietary hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid battery power units in heavy haul freight operations. Aurizon Network also finalised a new electricity contract for the Central Queensland Coal Network which includes 25% energy acquired from renewable sources such as solar and wind farms.\n\nThe varied performance across the Enterprise and Business Unit earnings measures, the significant improvement in safety measures and performance against individual measures are reflected directly in the STI payments for our Executive KMP. The Board has determined that an overall outcome above Target will be awarded to Coal, Network and Support Unit participants and an overall outcome below Target will be awarded to Bulk participants.\n\nThe Long Term Incentive (LTI) Award performance measures are Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). During FY2022, the 2018 LTI Award was subject to testing. No portion of the TSR component vested and these rights will lapse. ROIC achieved an outcome above the maximum vesting point and therefore 50% of the total award will vest in August 2022.\n\nThe Board considers that these overall remuneration outcomes reach an appropriate balance between business performance, shareholder outcomes and recognising the value-adding contribution of the Leadership Team.\n\nDuring FY2022, the Board continued to review and refine Aurizon's Remuneration Framework. With the continued growth of the business beyond rail, from FY2023 Aurizon is moving to a more comprehensive safety metric, Potential Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFRa+p). Encompassing all our activities across rail, ports, terminals, road transport and broader infrastructure, this measure will support our e/fforts in preventing serious injury events and driving improved safety performance. This metric will replace RPS. In addition, in response to shareholder feedback and to further align incentive structures with business strategy, the strategic transformation measure in the 2022 LTI Award will change from a non-coal gross revenue growth measure to a non-coal Underlying EBITDA growth measure. This change will continue to recognise the importance of growth opportunities as we build non-coal revenue across our portfolio but also ensures the Leadership Team maintains focus on driving value from the Bulk business, including the One Rail and ConPorts acquisitions. Further changes may be implemented from FY2024 to ensure the framework continues to deliver against our remuneration principles, long-term strategic outlook and to ensure it remains e/ffective in driving strong performance.\n\nWe are grateful for your ongoing support.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKate Vidgen\n\nChair, Remuneration and People/uni00A0Committee",

Company Performance for Financial/uni00A0Year 2022\n\nAurizon reported Group Underlying EBITDA of $1,468 million for continuing operations for year ended 30 June 2022 in line with the EBITDA guidance range ($1,425m-$1,500m).\n\nThis was a solid result given the uncertain business environment during the period, including major flooding events on the East Coast of Australia and ongoing COVID-19 related impacts on production for many of our customers. Aurizon's ability to deliver within guidance demonstrates the resilience of our Company, with strong operating discipline and revenue protection mechanisms in place, and the ongoing e/fforts and dedication of our employees during a challenging time.\n\nTable 4 shows historical Company performance across a range of key measures.

ROIC achieved an outcome above the maximum vesting point and therefore 50% of this Award will vest in August 2022.\n\nMovement in the Aurizon share price over the various performance periods is reflected in the remuneration outcomes for Executive KMP, aligning the Executive KMP outcomes with the shareholder experience.\n\nTABLE 5 - REMUNERATION EARNED IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2022\n\n| NAME          | FIXED  REMUNERATION   $'000   | NON-MONETARY  BENEFITS 1   $'000   | STIA   CASH 2 $'000   | STIA DEFERRED   FROM PRIOR YEAR 3 $'000   | LTIA  VESTING 4 $'000   | SHARE PRICE  DEPRECIATION 5 $'000   | ACTUAL FY2022  REMUNERATION OUTCOMES  $'000   |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP |                               |                                    |                       |                                           |                         |                                     |                                               |\n| A Harding     | 1,750                         | -                                  | 1,253                 | 760                                       | 1,030                   | (142)                               | 4,651                                         |\n| P Bains       | 800                           | -                                  | 447                   | 313                                       | 422                     | (58)                                | 1,924                                         |\n| G Lippiatt    | 750                           | -                                  | 398                   | 223                                       | 140                     | (17)                                | 1,494                                         |\n| C McDonald    | 710                           | -                                  | 239                   | 257                                       | 341                     | (47)                                | 1,500                                         |\n| E McKeiver    | 710                           | -                                  | 370                   | 182                                       | 371                     | (53)                                | 1,580                                         |\n\n- 1 Non-monetary benefits represent the value of Reportable Fringe Benefits for the respective FBT year ending 31 March.\n- 2  The amount relates to the cash component (60%) of the FY2022 STIA which will be paid in September 2022.\n- 3   The amount relates to the deferred component (40%) of the FY2021 STIA which was awarded in performance rights and will become unrestricted in September 2022 (calculation based on share price of $3.73 at date of issue).\n- 4   The amount relates to the portion of the 2018 Award which was subject to testing in FY2022 but will vest in August 2022 (calculation based on share price of $4.48 at date of issue).\n- 5   The amount is the number of rights which vest multiplied by the increase or decrease in the Aurizon share price over the period ended 30 June 2022 (calculation assumes share price appreciation of $0.07 Deferred STIA and a share price depreciation of $0.68 LTIA).",

Short Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the STIA and who participates?\n\nThe STIA is 'at risk' remuneration subject to the achievement of pre-defined Company, Business Unit and individual performance measures which are set annually by the Board at the beginning of the performance period.\n\nFor each component of the STIA, three performance levels are set:\n\n- \u203a Threshold, below which no STIA is paid for that component\n- \u203a Target, which typically aligns to relevant corporate plans and budgets, a business improvement targeted outcome or reflects an improvement on historical achievement\n- \u203a Stretch, outcomes which are materially better than Target.\n\nThe STIA applies in a similar manner to other eligible employees. For the MD & CEO, Executive KMP and the remaining Group Executives a portion (40%) will be deferred into equity for a period of 12 months, which is subject to claw-back for financial misstatements and misconduct.\n\n## What are the Company performance measures?\n\nThe performance measures which apply to all participants are Underlying EBITDA, Safety and individual performance.\n\nBusiness Unit measures are included in the scorecard for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nEach measure has a defined level of performance. The measures drive a continuous safety improvement culture and strengthen and grow our current business while continuing to transform the Enterprise.\n\n## FIGURE 4 -\n\n## STRATEGIC MEASURES CASCADING PROCESS\n\nFIGURE 5 STIA AT-TARGET PERFORMANCE OUTCOME/uni00A0CALCULATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is achieved through a focus on people and asset e/fficiencies while at the same time, delivering benefits to shareholders.\n\nIndividual performance measures relate to each specific role and measure an individual's contribution against a range of operational and strategic performance measures (including additional safety measures). At the start of the performance year the Board determines the MD & CEO's individual deliverables. Relevant deliverables are cascaded to the Executive Committee and throughout the organisation as reflected in Figure 4.\n\n## What is the amount that participants can/uni00A0earn through an STIA?\n\nThe employment agreements specify a target STIA, expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration (100% for the MD & CEO and 75% for the remaining Executive KMP). Each participant can earn between 0% up to a maximum of 150% of this target percentage, depending on performance and subject to Board discretion. Depending on performance assessed at year end, participants may earn for each enterprise measure: 0% for performance below Threshold; 50% at Threshold (for measures other than Underlying EBITDA, for which Threshold earnings are 30%) with a linear scale up to 100% at Target performance; and a further linear scale to 200% at Stretch performance.\n\nSTIA outcomes are determined by calculating the performance outcome against the relevant weighted performance measure. Figure 5 provides an example of an at-target performance outcome.\n\n## What are the outcomes for FY2022?\n\nTable 6 identifies the performance measures, relevant weightings and outcomes for FY2022. Target performance was achieved for Group Underlying EBITDA.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA outcomes varied across the Business Units, with Network achieving an outcome above Target performance, Coal achieving an outcome slightly below Target performance while Bulk performance was below Threshold.\n\nDuring the year Aurizon has progressed a number of initiatives to accelerate safety performance improvement which has seen a significant improvement in both TRIFR and RPS. As a result, both TRIFR and RPS have achieved a performance outcome above Stretch.\n\nThe STIA also considers performance against individual deliverables which vary for Executives and are aligned to strategic enterprise objectives.\n\nDuring FY2022, an example of a key individual deliverable has been progress against Aurizon's Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP), including our fleet decarbonisation program, which is supported by a multi-year research program and industry partnerships, and a new electricity contract for the Central Queensland Coal Network which includes 25% energy acquired from renewable sources such as solar and wind farms.\n\nFrom FY2023, a Potential Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFRa+p) performance measure will replace RPS. Changing the metric will ensure safety remains core to the business with increasing focus on high severity events that have the potential to seriously injure our people.\n\nThe FY2022 actual outcomes for Executive KMP are identified in Table 7.\n\nMD & CEO AND SUPPORT FUNCTION PARTICIPANTS\n\n<!-- image -->",

Long Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the LTIA and who participates?\n\nThe LTIA is the component of Total Potential Remuneration linked to providing long-term incentives for selected Executives whom the Board has identified as being able to contribute directly to the generation of long-term shareholder returns. This includes the MD & CEO, Executive KMP, the remaining Group Executives and a number of other management employees.\n\n## What is the amount that Executives can earn through an LTIA?\n\nThe maximum potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) available through the LTIA is 150% in the case of the MD & CEO and 112.5% for the remaining Executive KMP.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\nThe company hurdles for the LTIA are measured over a four-year period. Retesting does not form part of any award.\n\n## What are the performance hurdles?\n\nThe 2018 Award through to the 2020 Award have two performance hurdles: Relative Total Shareholder Return and Average Return on Invested Capital. From the 2021 Award a Strategic Transformation measure was introduced to reflect the growing aspirations of the Bulk business and other non-Coal investments as outlined in Table 9.\n\n## How is the LTIA determined?\n\nThe number of performance rights issued under the LTIA to each Executive is calculated by dividing their respective LTIA potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) by the five-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of Aurizon shares at the time of their award.\n\nEach performance right is a right to receive one share in Aurizon upon vesting. The number of performance rights that vest is determined by performance outcomes compared against predetermined company hurdles as described in Table 8 and Table 9.\n\n## What happens when performance rights/uni00A0vest?\n\nPerformance rights awarded under the LTIA vest subject to the satisfaction of company hurdles. Rights vest and the resulting shares are transferred to the Executive at no cost to the Executive. Value of the award will be subject to movements in the Aurizon share price over the performance period, aligning Executive outcomes and shareholder experience.\n\nCompany performance and vesting outcomes for the 2018 LTIA are identified in Table 8. Partial vesting of the LTIA has occurred which is aligned with the shareholder experience over the performance period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTABLE 8 - COMPANY PERFORMANCE AGAINST LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS SUBJECT TO TESTING IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2022\n\n| COMPANY HURDLE AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT/uni00A0PERIOD   |                                                                                                            | WEIGHTING   | RESULT       | %   VESTED   | %  LAPSED   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 2018 AWARD: 01 JULY 2018 - 30 JUNE 2022                    | 2018 AWARD: 01 JULY 2018 - 30 JUNE 2022                                                                    |             |              |              |             |\n| Relative TSR:  against peer  group within ASX100 Index     | 30% of rights vest at the 50th percentile, 75% at the  62.5th percentile up to 100% at the 75th percentile | 50%         | Below Median | 0%           | 100%        |\n| ROIC:  average annual ROIC  FY2019-FY2022                  | 50% of rights vest with an average ROIC of 9%,   up to 100% at 10%                                         | 50%         | 10.3%        | 100%         | 0%          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaximum/emspace\n\nBetween Minimum and Maximum/emspace\n\nMinimum/emspace\n\nBelow Minimum",

Retention awards may be time-based or project-based and are governed by stringent performance conditions and may be cash-based or equity-based. During FY2022, no retention awards were issued to Executive KMP and 78,900 performance rights were issued across three employees.

Executive Employment Agreements\n\n## Executive Employment Agreements\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the MD & CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in an Employment Agreement as summarised in Table 10.\n\n## Minimum shareholding and retention policy\n\nTo align KMP and Group Executives with shareholders, the Company requires:\n\n- \u203a Non-Executive Directors to accumulate and maintain one year's Total Directors' fees (consisting of Directors' fee plus applicable Committee fee/s) of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the MD & CEO to accumulate and maintain one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the remaining Executive KMP and Group Executives to accumulate and maintain 50% of one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company.\n\nThis is to be achieved within six years of the date of their appointment. This will be calculated with reference to the Total Directors' fees and Executives' Fixed Remuneration during the period divided by the number of years.\n\nDetails of KMP shareholdings as at 30 June 2022 are set out in Table 11.\n\n## Hedging and margin lending policies\n\nAurizon has in place a policy that prohibits Executives from hedging economic exposure to unvested rights that have been issued pursuant to a Company employee share plan. The policy also prohibits margin loan arrangements for the purpose of purchasing Aurizon shares. Adherence to this policy is monitored regularly and involves each Executive signing an annual declaration of compliance with the policy.\n\n## TABLE 10 - EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS\n\nTABLE 11 - KMP SHAREHOLDINGS AS AT 30 JUNE 2022\n\n| NAME          | DURATION OF   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   | FIXED REMUNERATION AT  END OF FINANCIAL YEAR  2022 1   | BY EXECUTIVE   | NOTICE PERIOD 2 BY COMPANY 3   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP |                                      |                                                        |                |                                |\n| A Harding     | Ongoing                              | $1,750,000                                             | 6 months       | 12 months                      |\n| P Bains       | Ongoing                              | $800,000                                               | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| G Lippiatt    | Ongoing                              | $750,000                                               | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| C McDonald    | Ongoing                              | $710,000                                               | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| E McKeiver    | Ongoing                              | $710,000                                               | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n\n- 1   Fixed remuneration includes a superannuation component.\n- 2  Post employment restraints in any competitor business in Australia are aligned to the notice period.\n- 3  Any termination payment will be subject to compliance with the Corporations Act 2001 and will not exceed 12 months (unless approved by shareholders).\n\n| NAME                    | BALANCE   AT THE START   OF THE YEAR   | RECEIVED   DURING THE YEAR   ON VESTING   | OTHER   CHANGES DURING   THE YEAR   | BALANCE   AT THE END   OF THE YEAR   | % OF FIXED  REMUNERATION 1   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS |                                        |                                           |                                     |                                      |                              |\n| T Poole 2               | 135,500                                | -

Non-Executive  Director Remuneration\n\nFees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level to attract and retain Directors with the necessary skills and experience to allow the Board to have a proper understanding of, and competence to deal with, current and emerging issues for Aurizon.\n\nRemuneration for Non-Executive Directors is reviewed by the Committee and set by the Board, taking into account external benchmarking. Fees and payments to Non-Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Board and reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of, the Directors.\n\nThe Chairman's fees are determined independently to the fees of Non-Executive Directors, based on comparative roles in the external market. The Chairman does not participate in any discussions relating to the determination of his own remuneration.\n\n## Fee structure\n\nThe current annual base fees for the Non-Executive Directors are set out in Table 12.\n\nThe Chairman's fee is inclusive of fees for Committee memberships.\n\nIn addition, to the base Directors' fee, the other Non-Executive Directors receive the applicable fee component for chairperson and/or membership responsibilities. These Committee fees are set out in Table 13.\n\nThe base Directors' fee and Committee fees include both cash and any contributions to a fund for the purposes of superannuation benefits. There are no other retirement benefits in place for Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors do not receive a performance pay.\n\nThe actual remuneration outcomes for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company are summarised in Table 14. Details of the Non-Executive Director membership are disclosed on page 9.\n\n## What are the aggregate fees approved by shareholders?\n\nThe aggregate fees are $2.5 million. The cap does not include remuneration for performing additional or special duties for Aurizon at the request of the Board or reasonable travelling, accommodation and other expenses of Directors in attending meetings and carrying out their duties.",

Negative amounts represent the utilisation of annual leave.\n- 4  Non-monetary benefits represent the value of Reportable Fringe Benefits for the respective FBT year ending 31 March.\n- 5   In assessing the overall performance for FY2021, the Board acknowledged the receipt of the WIRP fees which were payable following the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. The Board determined that a one-o/ff cash payment would be made to recognise the WIRP fees payable between FY2016 - FY2020 but collected in FY2021. Payment was made to Executive KMP in September 2021.\n- 6  Superannuation amounts represent employers' contribution to superannuation.\n- 7   The accounting expense recognised in relation to rights granted in the year is the fair value independently calculated at grant date using an expected outcome model. This was consistent with the Monte-Carlo simulation conducted in the prior year and resulted in similar outcomes. This amount is progressively expensed over the vesting period. Refer to note 27 for further details regarding the fair value of Rights. These values may not represent the future value that the Executive will receive, as the vesting of the Rights is subject to the achievement of performance conditions. This includes the cost of deferred short-term incentives and long-term incentives.\n- 8   The short-term incentives (cash bonus), deferred short-term incentives and long-term incentives (equity settled share-based payments) represent the at-risk performance related remuneration.",

The Directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial report.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, income and expense.\n\nThe areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes:\n\n|                                                                 |   Note |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Revenue                                                         |      2 |\n| Useful lives of property, plant and equipment                   |      8 |\n| Impairment of property, plant and equipment                     |      8 |\n| Impairment of cash generating units (CGUs)  and/uni00A0goodwill |      9 |\n\n## Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant and other accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used, and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements, are provided throughout the notes to the financial/uni00A0statements.\n\n## The notes to the financial statements\n\nThe following notes include information which is material and relevant to the operations, financial position and performance of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant due to its size and nature or if the information:\n\n- \u203a is important for understanding the Group's current period results;\n- \u203a provides an explanation of significant changes in the Group's business - for example acquisitions or divestments; or\n- \u203a relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that are important to its/uni00A0future performance.\n\n## Key events and transactions for the reporting period\n\n## (a)  Acquisitions\n\n## One Rail Australia LP\n\nThe Group signed a Partnership Interest Sale Agreement with Macquarie Asset Management (on behalf of its managed funds and clients) on 21 October 2021 to acquire 100% of the partnership interest in One Rail Australia Holdings LP (ORA) for consideration of $2,350.0 million. The acquisition completed on 29 July 2022 and the financial e/ffects of the transaction have not been recognised at 30 June 2022. Refer to note 31 for further information.\n\nORA comprises of two main business segments:\n\n- \u203a Integrated bulk rail haulage and general freight assets in South Australia (SA) and the Northern Territory (NT) and below rail operator and economic owner of 2,460km of rail infrastructure including the 2,245km Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway line (ORA Bulk); and\n- \u203a Coal haulage in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD) (East Coast Rail or ECR), including a long-term coal haulage contract with Glencore for its mines in the Hunter Valley and Central Queensland.\n\nORA Bulk will be integrated into the Group's bulk segment. ORA Bulk is the sole rail freight operator along the SA/NT corridor and commodities hauled include copper, grain, magnetite, phosphate and rare earths. Below rail infrastructure is operated under two long-term government concessions including the Tarcoola-to-Darwin Railway expiring 2054 and SA regional lines expiring 2047 and are regulated by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia (ECOSA).\n\nECR will be classified as a discontinued operation held for sale and will be divested through either a demerger or trade sale, whichever creates greater value for shareholders, in accordance with the terms of a Court-enforceable undertaking given by the Company to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nThe acquisition was funded from a combination of existing bank debt facilities/uni00A0and new underwritten facilities. The acquisition facilities include $1,450.0 million bank debt facilities with terms of 2 - 5 years for Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd, the financing entity for Aurizon Operations Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group) and $500.0 million secured amortising bank debt facilities with terms of 2 - 5 years for ECR. Borrowing costs for the acquisition facilities are estimated to be $25.0 million and will be capitalised to balance sheet and amortised to profit or loss over the expected term of the/uni00A0bank debt/uni00A0facilities.",

Separation and divestment related costs are estimated to be $25.0 million and include advisory fees, IT system separation costs, recruitment and other costs.\n\nTransaction costs of $14.2 million included in the estimates above have been incurred in FY2022 and expensed to profit or loss. This amount has been classified as a significant item.\n\n## Kooregah Pastoral Co Pty Ltd (KPC)\n\nThe Group acquired the business of KPC for consideration of $8.3 million on 28 October 2021. KPC is a trucking and material handling business that operates in and around Hermidale in NSW. Refer to note 22 for further information.\n\n## South Maitland Railways Pty Ltd (SMR)\n\nThe Group acquired 100% of the issued shares in SMR, a railway storage and maintenance provider near Newcastle in NSW, for consideration of $8.2 million and a land holding for $0.4 million on 1 March 2022. Refer to note 22 for further information.\n\n## (b)  Key events and transactions for the period 2017 Access Undertaking\n\nThe 2017 Access Undertaking (UT5) approved by the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) on 19 December 2019 included an increase in the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) from 5.90% to 6.30% upon Aurizon Network Pty Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group) notifying the Chair of the Rail Industry Group (RIG) of its proposed options to address any capacity deficits identified in the independent capacity assessment of the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN) completed by an Independent Expert.\n\nThe Independent Expert completed the Initial Capacity Assessment Report (ICAR) on 28 October 2021 and on 12 November 2021, Aurizon Network Pty Ltd provided the Chair of the RIG and the QCA its preliminary response to the ICAR. This was followed by a more detailed report, following consultation with customers, on 14 March 2022, on potential transitional arrangements to rectify the relevant coal systems' capacity deficits. On 17 June 2022, the Independent Expert made a recommendation to the QCA on which of the transitional arrangements identified in the detailed report would most e/ffectively and e/fficiently resolve the capacity deficits identified in the ICAR, following which the QCA will make a decision. The QCA has not made such a determination yet and therefore the impact of any such determination has not been assessed.\n\nFuture transitional arrangements and associated capital expenditure requirements will be subject to a range of factors including (i) concept and feasibility studies, (ii) staged reviews of certain transitional arrangements pending reviews of existing capacity deficits post execution of other arrangements and (iii) QCA approval. As a result of customer consultation, both Aurizon Network Pty Ltd and customers have agreed that forecast demand in the relevant coal system will also be a relevant factor and have submitted to the QCA that this should be taken into account.\n\nConsistent with the definition of the Report Date in UT5, notification to the Chair of the RIG on 12 November 2021 triggered an increase in the WACC from 5.90% to 6.30%. UT5 assumed the ICAR would be completed by 1 March 2020 and therefore a WACC of 6.30% was applied in determining tari/ffs from that date. As a result of the delay in the publication of the ICAR, there has been an over-collection of access charges (the di/fference between 5.90% and 6.30%) in FY2022 estimated to be $9.3 million that will be captured in the FY2022 revenue adjustment amount. The total FY2022 revenue adjustment amount to be recovered in FY2024 tari/ffs, is estimated to be a net under recovery of approximately $42.0 million ($30.0 million excluding GAPE), driven by annual volumes being lower than regulatory forecast and other adjustments, partly o/ffset by Take-or-Pay of $28.2 million recognised in FY2022. The FY2022 revenue adjustment is subject to approval by the QCA.\n\n## Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP)\n\nAurizon Network Pty Ltd settled all disputes with WIRP customers under their respective WIRP Deeds in July 2022. WIRP fees of $47.0 million have been recognised in FY2022 (2021: $60.3 million), including additional historical fees of $30.3 million relating to FY2016 - FY2021 and $16.7 million in fees relating to FY2022.\n\n## (c)   Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO) declaratory relief/uni00A0proceedings\n\nPrior to the Initial Public O/ffering in FY2010, the Queensland Government (the State) made an equity contribution to the Company of $4,388.3 million. This contribution was recorded separately to issued capital, in a capital distribution account (classified as capital reserve). Following on from engagement with the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO) in relation to the tax technical treatment of the State's contribution, the Company commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia (the Court) seeking a declaration from the Court that the capital distribution account is contributed equity for the purposes of tax law. In April 2022, the Court made a declaration that the Company's capital distribution account is share capital for tax purposes. The Court's declaration was not appealed by the ATO.\n\nCertain share buy-backs and incremental costs attributable to share buybacks have been deducted from the initial contribution and the carrying amount of the capital reserve at 1 July 2020 was $3,467.1 million. FY2021 is restated to reclassify the capital reserve to contributed equity.",

Revenue is recognised on an as-invoice basis/uni00A0because the right for consideration corresponds directly with the Group's performance obligations completed to date, except for contracts with a timing di/fference for which a contract asset or contract liability has been/uni00A0recognised.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, future contracted revenues for contracts with a timing di/fference are approximately $2,014.3 million, of which $506.2 million is expected to be recognised in FY2023. These amounts relate to track access, freight transport and other services from contracts with customers being high credit worthy counterparties. Future contracted revenues are in nominal FY2022 dollars. Variable revenue is not included. As such, the future contracted revenues described above represent only part of the Group's forecast revenues for FY2023 and beyond.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient in AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15), paragraph 121 to all other contracts and does not disclose information on future contracted revenues. This is because the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the Group's performance obligations completed to date.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Take-or-Pay revenue\n\nAurizon Network Pty Ltd is able to recover in the financial year part of an Allowable Revenue shortfall through Take-or-Pay clauses which may trigger when annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast. Take-or-Pay is calculated based on management's judgement of below rail cause and above rail operator and/or mine cancellations. This judgement impacts the calculation of Take-or-Pay and the receivable recognised in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved. Take-or-Pay revenue of $28.2 million has been recognised at 30 June 2022 (2021: $77.5 million).\n\n## Freight Transport Contract Modifications\n\nModifications to existing agreements where there is also a new agreement put in place are assessed based on the facts and substance of the individual contractual arrangements, and will be accounted for as either combined or separate contracts in accordance with AASB 15. There is significant judgement exercised in determining if a modification to an existing agreement should be treated as a combined or a separate contract. Judgement, including expected volumes to be railed in individual contract years and whether the contract price represents the market price in the respective contract period, is applied in determining the calculation of contract assets or contract liabilities recorded. These judgements impact the timing of revenue recognised over the term of the individual contract.\n\n## (c)  Accounting policies\n\nThe Group recognises revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue includes the provision of track access and freight transport services as described below.\n\n## (i) Track access\n\nTrack access revenue is generated from the provision of access to, and operation of, the CQCN under an approved Access Undertaking. Track access revenue is recognised over time as access to the rail network is provided and is measured on a number of operating parameters including volumes hauled applied to regulator approved tari/ffs. The tari/ffs charged are determined with reference to the total allowable revenue, applied to the regulatory approved annual volume forecast for each rail system. At each balance date, track access revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nWhere annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast, Take-or-Pay may trigger. Take-or-Pay is recognised as revenue and a receivable in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved as the related performance obligations have been satisfied.\n\nRegulated access revenue is subject to a revenue cap mechanism that serves to ensure the rail network recovers its Allowable Revenue over the regulatory period. A revenue adjustment event results in the under or over recovery of regulatory access revenue (net of Take-or-Pay revenue) for a financial year being recognised in the accounting revenues of the second financial year following the financial year in which the event occurred as per the Access Undertaking.\n\nAccess revenue for the financial year has been recognised based on the 2017 Access Undertaking applying a WACC rate of 6.30% (2021: 6.30%).

At each balance date, freight transport revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nA contract modification is a separate contract if the scope of services is increased by distinct additional services and the total price increases by the market rate for those services over the remaining contract period. Where the distinct services don't indicate market prices, weightedaverage contract rates are applied, which may result in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability that amortise over the term of the individual contract. Modifications to existing agreements where there is also a new agreement put in place are assessed based on the facts and substance of the individual contractual arrangements, and are accounted for as either combined or separate contracts.\n\nA contract asset is recorded for revenue when the Group does not have an unconditional right to invoice the customer for performance obligations satisfied. A contract liability is recorded for revenue received in advance of satisfying a performance obligation and is recognised over the term of the contract.\n\n## (iii)  Capitalisation of customer contract costs\n\nWhere incremental costs are incurred to secure a new contract or an extension to an existing customer contract, these costs are capitalised as a contract asset and amortised against revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n\nWhere an arrangement contains a significant financing component, the transaction price is adjusted to reflect the e/ffects of the financing component, and a contract asset is recognised and amortised against revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n\n## 3  Expenses\n\nProfit before income tax from continuing operations includes the following specific expenses:\n\n|                                                   | 2022  $m   | 2021   $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Employee benefits expense                         |            |             |\n| Salaries, wages and allowances including on-costs | 766.7      | 757.7       |\n| Defined contribution superannuation expense       | 74.0       | 69.1        |\n| Redundancies                                      | 12.7       | 13.9        |\n|                                                   | 853.4      | 840.7       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                     |            |             |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment     | 562.9      | 547.8       |\n| Amortisation of intangibles                       | 29.4       | 31.3        |\n|                                                   | 592.3      | 579.1       |\n| Finance expenses                                  |            |             |\n| Interest and finance charges paid/payable         | 127.5      | 149.8       |\n| Discounting of land rehabilitation provision      | 0.7        | 0.2         |\n| Interest paid on lease liability                  | 4.8        | 5.1         |\n| Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs       | 4.5        | 4.2         |\n| Amortisation of AMTN 2 fair value adjustment      | (2.4)      | (2.4)       |\n| Hedge ine/ffectiveness 1                          | (6.3)      | (3.8)       |\n|                                                   | 128.8      | 153.1       |\n| Capitalised interest paid on qualifying assets    | (1.9)      | (3.7)       |\n|                                                   | 126.9      | 149.4       |\n\n- 1 Refer to the accounting policy in note 18.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2022 (continued)\n\n## 4  Income tax (continued)\n\n## (d)  Accounting policies\n\nThe tax position is calculated based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, in the relevant operating jurisdiction. The tax laws and accounting standards have di/fferent rules in respect of timing and recognition of income and expense, resulting in temporary di/fferences (which reverse over time) and non-temporary di/fferences (which do not reverse over time or are temporary di/fferences that do not meet the recognition criteria under the accounting standards).\n\nIncome tax expense is calculated as the profit/(loss) before tax, multiplied by the applicable tax rate, and adjusted for non-temporary di/fferences. Income tax expense includes a current tax and deferred tax component and is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (i) Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable for the period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior periods. Current tax includes both temporary di/fferences and non-temporary di/fferences.\n\nThe positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are periodically evaluated and provisions are provided where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## (ii) Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax represents taxes to be paid or deductions available in future income years and any adjustment to deferred tax amounts in respect of prior periods. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary di/fferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except:\n\n- \u203a when arising on the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u203a when arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a/ffects neither accounting or taxable profit; or\n- \u203a where it is not probable that future amounts will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences or carried-forward tax losses.\n\n## (iii)  O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and when the deferred tax balances relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\n## (iv)  Tax consolidation legislation\n\nThe Company and its wholly owned Australian entities elected to form a tax consolidated group, and are taxed as a single entity. The head entity of the tax consolidated group is Aurizon Holdings Limited.\n\nThe Company and the entities in the tax consolidated group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer.\n\nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the Company also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from entities in the tax consolidated group.\n\nThe entities have entered into tax sharing and tax funding agreements. The tax funding agreement sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax consolidated group in respect of income tax amounts and requires payments to the Company equal to the current tax liability assumed by the Company. The Company is required to make payments equal to the current tax asset or deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses and tax credits assumed from a subsidiary member. The tax funding arrangement results in the Company recognising a current inter-entity receivable or payable equal to the tax liability or tax asset assumed.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly owned entities in the case of a default by the Company.\n\n## 5  Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n\n|                                                                            | 2022  Cents                                  | 2021  Cents                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Earnings per share for continuing operations                               | Earnings per share for continuing operations | Earnings per share for continuing operations |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                   | 27.9                                         | 32.5                                         |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                 | 27.8                                         | 32.4                                         |\n| Earnings per share                                                         | Earnings per share                           | Earnings per share                           |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                   | 27.9                                         | 39.1                                         |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                 | 27.8                                         | 39.0                                         |\n|                                                                            | 2022   Number   '000                         | 2021   Number   '000                         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary  shares for basic earnings per share   | 1,840,605                                    | 1,868,553                                    |\n| Dilution due to rights issued pursuant to  performance rights plans        | 3,992                                        | 1,909                                        |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares  for diluted earnings per share | 1,844,597                                    | 1,870,462                                    |",

No amounts were written o/ff in the financial year/uni00A0(2021:/uni00A0$3.0/uni00A0million).\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\n## (i) Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 31 days and are therefore classified as current.\n\n## (ii) Provision for impairment\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Individual debts which are known to be uncollectable are written o/ff when identified.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for impairment based on expected lifetime losses of trade and other receivables. The amount of the provision for impairment is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.\n\n## (b)  Credit risks related to receivables\n\nIn assessing an appropriate provision for impairment of trade and other receivables, consideration is given to historical experience of bad debts, the aging of receivables, knowledge of debtor insolvency and individual account assessment.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables exhibit similar credit risk characteristics and exposures. Customer credit risk is managed in accordance with the procedures and controls set out in the Group's credit risk management policy. Credit limits are established for all customers based on external and internal credit rating criteria. For some trade receivables, the Group may also obtain security in the form of guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letter of credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.\n\n## 7  Inventories\n\n|                                      | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                              |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 194.6      | 160.0      |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (8.4)      | (9.6)      |\n|                                      | 186.2      | 150.4      |\n| Non-current                          |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 68.8       | 59.0       |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (13.2)     | (13.1)     |\n|                                      | 55.6       | 45.9       |\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nInventories include infrastructure and rollingstock items held in centralised stores, workshops and depots. Items expected to be consumed after more than 12 months are classified as non-current.\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The/uni00A0cost of individual items of inventory are determined using weighted/uni00A0average cost.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for inventory obsolescence based on an assessment of damaged stock, slow-moving stock and stock that has become obsolete. The amount of the provision for inventory obsolescence is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.",

As part of Aurizon's Strategy in Uncertainty framework, scenario analysis is used to test market drivers and evaluate capital, fleet and haulage opportunities and sustainability in the context of climate change risks. A key component of this analysis is understanding the drivers of demand and supply for commodities transported. This process considers short-term impacts as well as risks that emerge over the medium to long term, where the timing and magnitude is less certain. In addition to the fundamental drivers of Australian commodities, more subjective factors are also considered including government policy and trade considerations.\n\n## Useful lives of infrastructure assets\n\nThe useful lives of infrastructure assets are determined based on the expected engineering life, capped at the remaining term of the infrastructure leases (87 years) and are reviewed annually. Infrastructure predominantly relates to CQCN assets. Aurizon Network Pty Ltd (Network) is responsible for the provision of access to, and operation of, the below rail regulated CQCN which connects 40 mines to five export terminals as well as to domestic customers.\n\nDemand for Australian coal is dependent on seaborne-traded markets which are increasingly concentrated in Asia. Metallurgical coal is primarily used to produce steel and thermal coal is used as a heat source in energy generation. Around 70% of volumes hauled across the CQCN network is metallurgical coal (remaining 30% thermal coal), with demand linked to Asian steel production. Therefore, the useful life of infrastructure assets will be impacted primarily by the future demand for Australian metallurgical coal which is dependent on economic development in Asia including steel intensive growth, alternatives to steel and current steel production methods, competing supply of metallurgical coal, changes in government policies (for example, domestic/imported coal preferences and net-zero emission targets) and technological advancements.\n\nNetwork earns a Return of Capital as part of Allowable Revenue for each coal system under the QCA approved Access Undertaking. The Return of Capital compensates Network for depreciation of the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) over QCA endorsed regulatory lives for individual asset classes which di/ffer to the expected engineering life used for statutory reporting purposes. The QCA has also approved an accelerated depreciation profile for additions to the RAB from FY2010 onwards. As a result, at the commencement of each regulatory period, where an asset class has a remaining regulatory useful life:\n\n- \u203a higher than 20 years, RAB depreciation is based on a 20-year rolling life, which resets to 20 years each regulatory period\n- \u203a lower than 20 years, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe accelerated depreciation profile adopted by the QCA increases the rate at which Network recovers the Return of Capital and increases Allowable Revenue in the near term.\n\nThe QCA approved economic life of the CQCN can be re-assessed at the commencement of each regulatory period and therefore the QCA approved economic life of the CQCN RAB is not an indicator that useful lives adopted for statutory reporting purposes should be revised.\n\nA range of indicators of global coal demand over the short, medium and long term are reviewed annually to assess the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to infrastructure assets for statutory reporting purposes. Indicators include the following:\n\n- \u203a Asian GDP growth and steel-related demand\n- \u203a crude steel production method and scrap metal availability\n- \u203a global supply competitiveness and Australian supply constraints for metallurgical coal\n- \u203a government policies, including the ability of customers to gain regulatory approvals and raise funding to support development of their resource base\n- \u203a climate policy targets and how they are intended to be met at both a country and corporate level, including net-zero emissions targets set by major import nations of Australian coal. Major import nations of Australian coal with net-zero emissions targets include India (2070), Japan (2050), South Korea (2050) and China (2060).\n- \u203a the viability of new and alternative technologies that are developed to reduce emissions targets such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and hydrogen-based steel making, that may positively or negatively impact future coal demand.\n\nThe impact of the above indicators and other factors that may emerge on global coal demand and Australian coal supply are uncertain at this time and di/fficult to predict. Consequently, there is a risk that the useful lives assigned to infrastructure assets may require revision in the future, resulting in a change in depreciation rates on a prospective basis. Figure 1 below summarises the annual depreciation profile of the current written down value of total infrastructure assets of $5,266.9 million over the useful life applied for each class of assets described in note 8(b)(i) and excludes future capital investments.\n\nfifl/ffi/ffi/uni00A0/ffGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<24>/ffGLYPH<23>/ffiGLYPH<22>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<26>/ffiflGLYPH<20>GLYPH<26>fl/ffi/uni00A0GLYPH<25>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<21>/uni00A0GLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<18>/ffiGLYPH<17>GLYPH<16>GLYPH<15>/uni00A0\n\nFIGURE 1 -INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS DEPRECIATION PROFILE\n\n<!-- image -->",

The useful lives of rollingstock assets are determined based on the expected engineering life and are reviewed annually.\n\nIn performing the annual review of the appropriateness of the useful lives of rollingstock assets, management monitors and assesses a range of indicators influencing demand and supply of rollingstock over the short, medium and long term. Indicators include the following:\n\n- \u203a long-term market and commodity demand under six scenarios developed under our Strategy in Uncertainty framework\n- \u203a our contract position in key markets\n- \u203a flexibility of fleet capacity, including the ability to shift standard gauge fleet between New South Wales and Western Australia\n\n## (a)  Leases\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group primarily leases buildings with terms mostly ranging from one to 20 years. The leases generally provide the Group with the right to renewal at which time the lease terms are renegotiated. The Group applies the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:\n\n- \u203a payments for short-term leases of less than 12 months are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred; and\n- \u203a payments for leases for which the underlying asset is of a low value are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## Other leased assets\n\nThe following table summarises the coal infrastructure and corridor land and buildings leases:\n\n| Leases                        | Lessee                  | Lessor                                                                         | Term     | Expiry       | Rental Amount   | Extension  Option 1   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| CQCN                          | Aurizon Network Pty Ltd | State of Queensland (land)  and Queensland Treasury  Holdings (infrastructure) | 99 years | 30 June 2109 | $1 if demanded  | 99 years              |\n| Part of the North  Coast Line | Aurizon Network Pty Ltd | State of Queensland (land)  and Queensland Rail  (infrastructure)              | 99 years | 30 June 2109 | $1 if demanded  | 99 years              |\n\n- 1 The extension option is on the same terms as the initial lease period. Notice must be provided within at least 20 years prior to the expiring of the existing term. The extension option under the corridor land leases are dependent on the infrastructure lease extension being exercised and granted.\n\n(WA),/uni00A0narrow gauge fleet between Queensland and WA, and between commodities within states\n\n- \u203a competitors, fleet mix and their associated investment profile over/uni00A0time\n- \u203a the risk of obsolescence as alternative technologies are developed\n- \u203a continuous improvement in fleet investment strategies such as those predicated on condition-based and preventative maintenance/uni00A0approaches, as well as advancements in component change-out models.\n\nThe impact of the above indicators and other factors that may emerge on demand and supply of rollingstock are uncertain. Consequently, there is a risk (both upside and downside) that the engineering useful lives assigned to rollingstock assets may require revision to an alternate benchmark in the future resulting in a change in depreciation rates on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The level of rollingstock required is determined with consideration of the Group's Enterprise Fleet Plan (EFP). Key assumptions include forecast volumes, productivity and contingent fleet requirements. There is a risk that the key assumptions applied in the EFP may be impacted by the e/ffects of indicators described in the useful lives judgements and do not reflect actual rollingstock requirements.

Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items and borrowing costs that are related to the acquisition or construction of an asset. Costs may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, except for motor vehicles included in plant and equipment for which depreciation is calculated on a diminishing value method. Straight-line allocates the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment net of residual values over the expected useful life of each asset. Estimates of remaining useful life and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, on an annual basis.\n\nThe useful lives applied for each class of assets are:\n\n| Infrastructure, including:     |               |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|\n| - Tracks                       | 7 - 50 years  |\n| - Track turnouts               | 20 - 25 years |\n| - Ballast                      | 8 - 20 years  |\n| - Civil works                  | 20 - 99 years |\n| - Bridges                      | 30 - 99 years |\n| - Electrification              | 20 - 50 years |\n| - Field signals                | 15 - 40 years |\n| Buildings                      | 10 - 40 years |\n| Rollingstock, including:       |               |\n| - Locomotives                  | 25 - 35 years |\n| - Locomotives componentisation | 8 - 12 years  |\n| - Wagons                       | 25 - 35 years |\n| - Wagon componentisation       | 10 - 17 years |\n| Plant and equipment            | 3 - 20 years  |\n\nAn asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.",

Where the Group is a sub-lessor and the sub-lease is for the duration of the head lease, the right-of-use asset recognised from the head lease is derecognised and a lease receivable equal to the present value of future lease payments receivable is recognised.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present-value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u203a fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u203a variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; and\n- \u203a payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u203a the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u203a any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and\n- \u203a any initial direct costs.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which varies from two to 20 years.\n\n## (iii)  Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment subject to depreciation is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nIn testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for an individual asset or, if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for the individual asset, the recoverable amount for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent from the cash flows of other assets or group of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a reportable segment.\n\nAssets are impaired if their carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal or value-in-use.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs) and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs).\n\nWhere there is an indicator that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, the asset is tested for impairment. The impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset and is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised.",

Goodwill is tested annually or more regularly if there are indicators of impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of the value-in-use (VIU) method or the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) method, both of which require the use of assumptions. These calculations use cash flow projections extrapolated using estimated growth rates.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the goodwill allocation and the key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount:\n\n|                              | Bulk  NSW   | Bulk  QLD   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 2022                         |             |             |\n| Goodwill allocation ($m)     | 21.5        | 5.2         |\n| Valuation approach           | FVLCD       | VIU         |\n| Discount rate basis          | Post-tax    | Pre-tax     |\n| Discount rate (%)            | 8.0         | 11.5        |\n| Cash flow projection (years) | 20          | 4           |\n| Long-term growth rate (%)    | 2.5         | 2.5         |\n| 2021                         |             |             |\n| Goodwill allocation ($m)     | 19.7        | 5.2         |\n| Valuation approach           | FVLCD       | VIU         |\n| Discount rate basis          | Post-tax    | Pre-tax     |\n| Discount rate (%)            | 8.5         | 10.8        |\n| Cash flow projection (years) | 20          | 4           |\n| Long-term growth rate (%)    | 2.0         | 2.0         |",

CGUs containing goodwill are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. CGUs that have previously recognised an impairment to the carrying amount are reviewed for impairment reversal whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount may exceed the carrying amount.\n\nIndicators of impairment reversal were identified for the Western Australia CGU. The carrying amount of the Bulk QLD and Bulk NSW CGUs contain goodwill and have therefore also been tested for impairment.\n\nThere is a risk that the assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount of the CGUs may be impacted by the e/ffects of indicators described in the useful lives judgements and as a result change the estimated recoverable amount.\n\n## Western Australia CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Western Australia CGU has been determined based on VIU methodology. The calculation uses a four-year cash flow projection, a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% (2021: 10.8%) and a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2021: 2.0%). The Western Australia CGU was tested for sensitivity of the pre-tax discount rate as well as other factors noted below.\n\nThe Western Australia CGU has a small number of customers and the recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in iron ore customer contractual arrangements. The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined taking into consideration expected expiry of iron ore customer contracts. Should contracts with iron ore customers not be renewed or the iron ore customers either cease to operate before the expected end-of-mine life or be unable to comply with current contractual arrangements, it may result in a change to the impairment recorded for the CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, therefore no further impairment has been recognised. Due to the carrying value being highly sensitive to the iron ore customer assumptions, no reversal of previous impairments has been recognised.\n\n## Bulk QLD CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Bulk QLD CGU has been determined based on VIU methodology and the cash flow projection, pre-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate as described in note 9(a). The Bulk QLD CGU was tested for sensitivity of the pre-tax discount rate and changes in customer contractual arrangements.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in customer contractual arrangements and should any major contracts not be renewed it may result in a reduction to the recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, including goodwill, therefore no further impairment has been recognised. Due to the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to the renewal of major customer contracts, no reversal of previous impairments has been recognised.\n\n## Bulk NSW CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Bulk NSW CGU has been determined based on FVLCS methodology and the cash flow projection, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate as described in note 9(a). The recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in customer contractual arrangements and, should forecast growth in revenue not be achieved, it may result in a reduction to the recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, including goodwill, therefore no impairment has been recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (b)  Accounting policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(i)\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe goodwill recognised by the Group is a result of business combinations and represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is initially measured as the amount the Group paid to acquire a business over and above the fair value of net assets acquired.\n\n## (ii) Software\n\nCosts incurred in developing products or systems, and costs incurred in acquiring software and licences that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and services, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Software development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase, and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset.\n\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service contracts which provide the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing licence fees, are recognised as an expense in profit or loss. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances or creates additional capability to existing systems and are recognised as an intangible asset when the recognition criteria are met.\n\nSoftware is stated at historical cost, less any accumulated amortisation or impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which varies from three to 11 years.",

They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.\n\nLiabilities for annual leave and long service leave are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting date. Expected future payments that are not expected to be settled within 12 months are discounted using market yield at the reporting date of Australian corporate bond rates and reflects the terms to maturity. Remeasurements as a result of adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nA liability for short-term incentive plans is recognised based on a formula that takes into consideration the Group and individual key performance indicators. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.\n\nA termination benefit is payable when the Group decides to terminate the employment, or when an employee accepts redundancy in exchange for these benefits. A provision is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the o/ffer of those benefits or when the Group recognises costs for restructuring and is measured using the present value of the expected amounts to be paid to settle the obligation.\n\nEmployee benefits are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Group does not have any unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\n\n## (ii) Superannuation\n\nAurizon Holdings Limited and the following subsidiaries are members of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (QSuper) multiemployer defined benefit superannuation plan and are required to contribute a specific percentage of employee benefits expense to fund the retirement benefits of 546 employees (2021: 593):\n\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations Limited\n- \u203a Aurizon Network Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Australia Eastern Railroad Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Australia Western Railroad Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Aurizon Intermodal Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Interail Australia Pty Ltd.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of AASB 119 Employee Benefits , given the lack of su/fficient information available, the plan is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution plan. Defined contribution superannuation expense in note 3 includes $8.4 million (2021: $9.7 million) relating to the QSuper defined benefit plan.\n\n## (iii)  Provision for insurance claims\n\nA provision is raised for insurance claims external to the Group for claims in relation to loss or damage to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (iv)  Litigation and workers compensation provision\n\nA provision is made for the estimated liability for workers' compensation and litigation claims. Claims are assessed separately for common law, statutory and asbestos claims. Estimates are made based on the average number of claims and average claim payments over a specified period of time. Claims that are Incurred But Not Reported are also included in the estimate.\n\n## (v)  Land rehabilitation\n\nA provision is recognised for the present value of estimated costs of land rehabilitation where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a site.\n\nAn inflation rate of 2.6% (2021: 2.4%) is applied to estimate future land rehabilitation costs. This estimate is discounted at a weighted average discount rate of 3.8% (2021: 2.0%) to determine the present value of the provision. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss in finance costs and the movement in the provision is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.\n\n## 13 Other liabilities\n\n|                               | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                       |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 47.5       | 56.5       |\n| Income received in advance    | -          | 1.3        |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 16.0       | 1 7.0      |\n| Other current liabilities     | 5.2        | 16.8       |\n|                               | 68.7       | 91.6       |\n| Non-current                   |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 109.2      | 135.0      |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 107.1      | 120.7      |\n| Other non-current liabilities | 1.4        | 1.4        |\n|                               | 217.7      | 257.1      |\n\n## (a)  Contract liabilities\n\nRefer to note 2(b) for further information relating to contract liabilities.\n\n## (b)  Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities represent the present value of future lease payments.

The Group monitors its capital structure by reference to gearing ratio, ability to generate free cash flow and credit rating.\n\nNet debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease liabilities. Net gearing ratio is defined as Net debt divided by Net debt plus Equity. Net debt and Net gearing ratio are measures of the Group's indebtedness and provides an indicator of the balance sheet strength. An alternative net gearing ratio is also disclosed and includes derivative financial instruments used to hedge market risk on borrowings and is reconciled in the Non-IFRS Financial Information on page 117.\n\n|                                 | Notes   | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|---------------------------------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Total borrowings                | 17      | 3,220.8    | 3,738.0    |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents |         | (172.1)    | (148.8)    |\n| Net debt                        |         | 3,048.7    | 3,589.2    |\n| Total equity                    |         | 4,412.3    | 4,274.6    |\n| Total capital                   |         | 7,461.0    | 7,863.8    |\n| Net gearing ratio               |         | 40.9%      | 45.6%      |\n| Alternative net gearing ratio   |         | 42.5%      | 44.6%      |\n\n## 15 Dividends\n\n|                                         | Cents  per share   | $m    |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| Declared and paid during the period     |                    |       |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2022         |                    |       |\n| Final dividend for 2021 (70% franked)   | 14.4               | 265.0 |\n| Interim dividend for 2022 (95% franked) | 10.5               | 193.3 |\n|                                         |                    | 458.3 |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2021         |                    |       |\n| Final dividend for 2020 (70% franked)   | 13.7               | 262.3 |\n| Interim dividend for 2021 (70% franked) | 14.4               | 266.5 |\n|                                         |                    | 528.8 |\n| Proposed and unrecognised at period end |                    |       |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2022         |                    |       |\n| Final dividend for 2022 (100% franked)  | 10.9               | 200.6 |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2021         |                    |       |\n| Final dividend for 2021 (70% franked)   | 14.4               | 266.2 |\n\n## Franked dividends\n\nFranking credits are available to shareholders of the Company at the 30% (2021: 30%) corporate tax rate.

Refer to note 27 for further details of the Group's performance rights plans.\n\nThe fair value of rights granted are recognised as an employee benefits expense in profit or loss with a corresponding increase in the sharebased payment reserve in equity and is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the right.\n\nWhere the Company purchases ordinary shares to satisfy performance rights plans, the consideration paid is deducted from the share-based payment reserve.\n\n## (iii)  Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nOn consolidation all exchange di/fferences arising from translation of controlled entities with a financial currency that is not Australian dollars are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, or ceases, the cumulative amount recognised within the reserve relating to that foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## 17 Borrowings\n\nThe Group borrows money through bank debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities in capital markets.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's borrowings are as follows:\n\n|                             | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current - Unsecured         |            |            |\n| Bank debt facilities        | 255.0      | 59.0       |\n|                             | 255.0      | 59.0       |\n| Non-current - Unsecured     |            |            |\n| Medium-Term Notes           | 2,852.8    | 3,210.4    |\n| Bank debt facilities        | 120.0      | 480.0      |\n| Capitalised borrowing costs | (7.0)      | (11.4)     |\n|                             | 2,965.8    | 3,679.0    |\n| Total borrowings            | 3,220.8    | 3,738.0    |\n\nThe Group's bank debt facilities contain financial covenants. The bank debt facilities and Medium-Term Notes contain general undertakings including negative pledge clauses which restrict the amount of security that the Group can provide over assets in certain circumstances. The/uni00A0Group has complied with all required covenants and undertakings throughout the reporting period.\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk as set out in note 18(a). Details of the Group's financing arrangements and exposure to risks arising from borrowings are set out in note 18(b).\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable borrowing costs. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method.\n\nDirectly attributable borrowing costs are capitalised and amortised over the expected term of the bank debt facilities and Medium-Term Notes.\n\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period which are classified as non-current liabilities.",

The net loss represents the e/ffective portion of hedges which have been recognised in finance expense.\n\n## (ii) E/ffects of hedge accounting\n\nThe table below summarises the hedging instruments used to manage market risk:\n\n|                                                   | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current assets                                    |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | 42.3       | -          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                        | 1.5        | 0.1        |\n|                                                   | 43.8       | 0.1        |\n| Non-current assets                                |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps - Finance AMTN 1              | -          | 1.9        |\n| CCIRS - Network EMTN 1                            | 37.9       | 109.2      |\n| CCIRS - Network EMTN 2                            | -          | 13.9       |\n|                                                   | 37.9       | 125.0      |\n| Total derivative financial instrument assets      | 81.7       | 125.1      |\n| Current liabilities                               |            |            |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                        | -          | 0.5        |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | -          | 0.1        |\n|                                                   | -          | 0.6        |\n| Non-current liabilities                           |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | -          | 40.2       |\n| Interest rate swaps - Finance AMTN 1              | 66.1       | -          |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 3              | 10.8       | 0.4        |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 4              | 105.1      | 26.0       |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 5              | 13.0       | -          |\n| CCIRS - Network EMTN 2                            | 71.3       | -          |\n|                                                   | 266.3      | 66.6       |\n| Total derivative financial instrument liabilities | 266.3      | 67.2       |\n\nThe Group has issued Australian dollar Medium-Term Notes (AMTNs) and EMTNs under its wholly owned subsidiaries Aurizon Network Pty Ltd and Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd which have separate designations in hedging relationships.",

The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, in which case the remeasurement is recognised in equity.\n\nA derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designated the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment at hedge inception date and on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item and a qualitative assessment is performed to assess e/ffectiveness. If changes in circumstances a/ffect the terms of the hedged item, such as the terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedged instrument, a hypothetical derivative method is used to assess e/ffectiveness.\n\nThe main source of hedge ine/ffectiveness is the e/ffect of the credit risk di/fferential between the Group and its respective counterparties (i.e. credit curves) on the fair value of interest rate swaps and CCIRS, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item. Ine/ffectiveness may be due to di/fferences in the critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans or in the timing of forecast transactions. Hedge ine/ffectiveness is recognised against the mark-to-market position of the derivative financial instrument and in profit or loss in finance costs.\n\n## Rebalancing\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ine/ffectiveness is calculated and accounted for at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and are accounted for as set out in the table below.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n|                                     | Fair value hedge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Cash flow hedge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| What is it?                         | A derivative or financial instrument designated as  hedging the change in fair value of a recognised asset  or liability or firm commitment.

The market interest rates were determined to be between 1.0% and 6.6% (2021: 1.0% and 3.2%) depending on the type of facility.\n\nThe Group measures the fair value of financial instruments using market observable data where possible. Fair values are categorised into three levels with each of these levels indicating the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for an identical asset or liability in an active market\n\nLevel 2: Directly or indirectly observable market data\n\n- Level 3: Unobservable market data\n\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts are determined as the unrealised gain/(loss) with reference to market rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the net present value of contracted cash flows. The existing exposure method, which estimates future cash flows to present value using credit adjusted discount factors after counterparty netting arrangements, has been adopted for both forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\nThe fair value of CCIRS is determined as the net present value of contract cash flows. The future probable exposure method is applied to the estimated future cash flows to reflect the credit risk of the Group and relevant counterparties.\n\nThe Group's derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 (2021: Level 2). During the period, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (2021: nil).",

Investments are initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of net profit or loss. The carrying value of an investment is reduced by the value of dividends received from the joint venture.\n\nThe carrying amount of investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 8.\n\n## 20 Material subsidiaries\n\nThe ultimate parent of the Group is Aurizon Holdings Limited.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are treated as external from the date that the operation was discontinued. Where arrangements between the continuing and discontinued operations will continue subsequent to disposal, transactions including revenue and expenses are included in continuing operations profit or loss/uni00A0with elimination entries recognised in profit or loss of the discontinued operation.\n\nInter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## (b)  Changes in ownership interest\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The re-measured fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest of an associate, joint venture or financial asset. Any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities and may result in amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.",

The schemes have various terms and performance measures.\n\nThis note should be read in conjunction with the Remuneration Report, as set out in the Directors' Report, which contains detailed information regarding the setting of remuneration for KMP.\n\nThe table below summarises the total movements in the performance rights issued by the Group:\n\n|           | Balance  at start of  the year  Number  '000   | Granted  during  the year  Number   '000   | Exercised  during  the year  Number  '000   | Forfeited  during  the year  Number  '000   | Balance  at end of  the year/one.num  Number  '000   |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2022      |                                                |                                            |                                             |                                             |                                                      |\n| STIA      | 391                                            | 541                                        | (391)                                       | -                                           | 541                                                  |\n| LTIA      | 8,512                                          | 3,364                                      | -                                           | (1,960)                                     | 9,916                                                |\n| Retention | 84                                             | 79                                         | (17)                                        | -                                           | 146                                                  |\n| Total     | 8,987                                          | 3,984                                      | (408)                                       | (1,960)                                     | 10,603                                               |\n| 2021      |                                                |                                            |                                             |                                             |                                                      |\n| STIA      | 428                                            | 391                                        | (428)                                       | -                                           | 391                                                  |\n| LTIA      | 7,990                                          | 2,958                                      | (267)                                       | (2,169)                                     | 8,512                                                |\n| Retention | 281                                            | 67                                         | (264)                                       | -                                           | 84                                                   |\n| Total     | 8,699                                          | 3,416                                      | (959)                                       | (2,169)                                     | 8,987                                                |\n\nDuring the period, the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $9.0 million (2021: $4.9 million).\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date performance rights were exercised during the period was $3.71 (2021: $4.40).

These amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements related to the Group's EMTNs and allow the Group to apply certain exemptions in respect of hedge relationships that are impacted by market-wide interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has applied these reliefs resulting in no impact on the Group's hedge accounting. Upon transition to alternative benchmarks the Group will seek to apply further reliefs in AASB 9 and continue to apply hedge accounting to its hedging arrangements.\n\nThe Group has no contractual cash flows linked to IBOR, as all foreign currency borrowings are fixed rate which are swapped back to domestic floating using CCIRS, however, IBOR reform impacts the components of hedge designation in di/fferent hedge relations.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group had Euro dominated fixed rate borrowings that were swapped back to AUD floating BBSW through CCIRS hedges. These hedging instruments have both fair value and cash flow hedge components:\n\nPrior to\n\n| Hedge  relationship   | transition  instrument type                                                                                                                                  | Latest maturity   | Nominal in  foreign currency   | Nominal in local  currency   | Hedged item                                                                                                                                                  | Transition  progress                         |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge      | Benchmark portion  of the receive fixed  EUR coupon relate  to EUR swap rates                                                                                | Sept-2024         |                                |                              | Benchmark portion  of the EUR fixed  coupons related to  EUR swap interest  rates over the term  of the bond                                                 |                                              |\n| Cash flow hedge       | Receive benchmark  EUR cash flow,  pay benchmark  AUD cash flow  combined with  EUR and AUD  notional principal  exchanges at  e/ffective and  maturity date | Sept-2024         | \u20ac1,000.0m                      | $1,488.8m                    | EUR principal  repayment of the  bond from first  repayment date  until maturity of  the bond                                                                | Working with  provider to  transition across |\n| Cash flow hedge       | Receive cash  margin above the  portion of the  fixed EUR interest  coupon of the  CCIRS equivalent  to credit margin  component of  the bond over           | Sept-2024         |                                |                              | Margin above  swap benchmark  rate portion of the  EUR fixed coupon  payable on the  bond (equivalent  to credit margin  on debt) over the  term of the bond | to the new  benchmark                        |\n\nManagement is expecting to have no significant impact of IBOR reform, except for the operational risk. The current treasury management system is undergoing upgrades to fully manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates and there is a risk that such upgrades are not fully functional in time, resulting in additional manual procedures which give rise to operational risks.",

Short-term deposits are made for varying periods, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\n## (c)  Foreign currency transactions\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the entities included within the Group are measured using the currency of the economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the entity using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the monetary assets and liabilities, or from the settlement of foreign currency translations, are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The amounts deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges are recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of entities within the Group that have a functional currency di/fferent from the presentation currency are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and profit or loss are translated at the average exchange for the year. The exchange di/fferences arising on the balance sheet translation are taken directly to a separate component in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\n## (d)  Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. In accordance with the acquisition method, the Group measures goodwill, at acquisition date, as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value of the consideration transferred comprises the initial cash paid and an estimate for any future contingent or deferred payments the Group may be liable to pay.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made particularly around the determination of fair value of any contingent or deferred consideration, the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and liabilities assumed. Such estimates are based on information available at acquisition date.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nPredecessor value method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations that involve entities under common control. Acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their existing carrying values and no goodwill is recorded. Retrospective presentation of the acquired entity's results and balance sheet are incorporated as if both entities had always been combined.\n\n## (e)   Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less cost of disposal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less cost of disposal of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.\n\nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value. If the financial asset is not subsequently accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, then the initial measurement includes transaction costs that are directly attributable to the asset's acquisition or origination. On initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on its business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.\n\n## (ii) Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest method and net of any impairment loss, if:\n\n- \u203a  the asset is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u203a  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset (or group of financial assets) is impaired.\n\n## (iii)  Non-derivative liabilities\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and debt securities issued on the date when they originate. Other financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n## (g)  Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO). In this case, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable/uni00A0to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the/uni00A0balance sheet.\n\nCash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis. The/uni00A0GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO, are presented/uni00A0as operating cash flows.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are grouped for GST purposes. Therefore, any inter-company transactions within the Group do not attract/uni00A0GST.",

There were no material contingent liabilities requiring disclosure in the financial statements, other than as set out below.\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nFor information about guarantees and letters of credit given by the Group, refer to note 18(d). For information about the MIC Parent Company Guarantee, refer to note 21(b).\n\n## Transfer duty exemption\n\nThe transfer of ownership of Aurizon Network Pty Ltd from Aurizon Operations Limited to Aurizon Holdings Limited in August 2019 qualified for an exemption from transfer duty under the Queensland Duties Act 2001 . Should duty become payable in respect of the restructure (for example, due to a change in ownership of Aurizon Network Pty Ltd within three years of the transfer of the shares in August 2019), Aurizon estimates the duty liability may be approximately $295 million.\n\n## (b)  Contingent assets\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nFor information about guarantees given to the Group, refer to note 18(d).\n\n## (c)  Capital commitments\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group has capital commitments contracted but not provided for in respect of the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $140.1 million (2021: $77.3 million) which are due within one/uni00A0year.\n\n## 31  Events occurring after the reporting period\n\n## (i) Acquisition of One Rail Australia LP (ORA)\n\nThe acquisition of ORA completed on 29 July 2022 and the transaction has not been recognised at 30 June 2022. Details of the provisional purchase price consideration, net assets acquired and goodwill have not been disclosed as the Group had not yet completed the provisional accounting for the acquisition at the time the financial statements were authorised for issue as access to key information was restricted until completion. Refer to key events and transactions for other information in relation to the acquisition.\n\n## (ii) Debt financing\n\nOn 29 July 2022, the Group satisfied customary closing conditions on new bank debt facilities summarised in the table below. The bank debt facilities contain financial covenants and general undertakings, including negative pledge clauses which restrict the amount of security the Group can provide over assets in certain circumstances.\n\n|                                         | Maturity   | Facility  Limit $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd - Unsecured     |            |                      |\n| Bridge facility                         | Jul-24     | 650.0                |\n| Revolving facility                      | Jul-25     | 400.0                |\n| Term loan facility                      | Jul-27     | 400.0                |\n|                                         |            | 1,450.0              |\n| NHK Pty Ltd (East Coast Rail) - Secured |            |                      |\n| Working capital facility                | Jul-23     | 15.0                 |\n| Bridge facility                         | Jul-24     | 250.0                |\n| Amortising loan facility                | Jul-27     | 250.0                |\n|                                         |            | 515.0                |",

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.",

        "page_content": "## Non-IFRS Financial Information in the FY2022 Annual Report\n\nIn addition to using profit as a measure of the Group and its segments' financial performance, Aurizon uses EBITDA (Statutory and Underlying), EBITDA margin (Statutory and Underlying), EBIT (Statutory and Underlying), NPAT Underlying, Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), Net debt and Net gearing ratio. These measurements are not defined under IFRS and are, therefore, termed 'Non-IFRS' measures.\n\nEBITDA - Statutory is Group profit before net finance costs, tax, depreciation and amortisation, while EBIT - Statutory is defined as Group profit before net finance costs and tax. Underlying can di/ffer from Statutory due to exclusion of significant items that permits a more appropriate and meaningful analysis of the underlying performance on a comparative basis. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing underlying EBITDA by total revenue. These measures are considered to be useful measures of the Group's operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.\n\nNPAT- Underlying represents the underlying EBIT less finance costs, tax expense and the tax impact of significant adjustments.\n\nROIC is defined as underlying rolling 12-month EBIT divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated as the rolling 12-month average of net assets (excluding cash, borrowings, tax, derivative financial assets and liabilities). This measure is intended to ensure there is alignment between investment in infrastructure and superior returns for shareholders.\n\nNet debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease liabilities. Net gearing ratio is defined as Net debt divided by Net debt plus Equity. Net debt and Net gearing ratio are measures of the Group's indebtedness and provides an indicator of the balance sheet strength. An alternative Net debt and Net gearing ratio are also disclosed to include derivative financial instruments used to hedge market risk on borrowings.\n\nThese above mentioned measures are commonly used by management, investors and financial analysts to evaluate companies' performance.\n\nA reconciliation of the Non-IFRS measures and specific items to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is included in the table.
