The energy transition continued to accelerate and collided with macroeconomic and geopolitical events, resulting in major volatility in energy prices. A number of domestic factors added to the challenging conditions, with significant coal power plant outages in the market and wet weather affecting both renewables output and coal supply. This, in turn, caused an acute tightening of electricity and gas supply, leading to escalated wholesale prices.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the industry, the excellent operating performance of Origin's generation fleet played a vital role in keeping the lights on for customers. We are very aware that some customers have been concerned about rising energy prices at a time of broader cost of living pressures, and we have continued to prioritise support for those in a vulnerable financial position.\n\nOverall, we are pleased with how the business has performed this year, navigating myriad challenges and delivering higher underlying profit and strong cash flow. We have taken important steps to put Origin in a stronger position for the future, including announcing a refreshed strategy and ambition to lead the energy transition through cleaner energy and customer solutions.\n\nWe will shortly release new, more ambitious targets to accelerate emissions reduction across our business as part of Origin's first Climate Transition Action Plan. This plan will be subject to a nonbinding, advisory vote at our 2022 Annual General Meeting on 19 October.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOrigin's FY2022 financial performance reflected the strength of our integrated business, with strong commodity prices driving higher earnings from our Integrated Gas business, helping offset lower earnings from Energy Markets.\n\nUnderlying profit rose 30 per cent to $407 million, and Underlying EBITDA rose to $2,114 million, compared to $2,036 million in the prior year. On a statutory basis, Origin announced a loss of $1,429 million, reflecting a $2,196 million non-cash impairment.\n\nA $4,354 million uplift of in-the-money Energy Markets derivative assets associated with the hedging of very high wholesale electricity and gas prices resulted in the requirement to recognise the non-cash impairment of goodwill. This does not reflect the performance of the business, future cash flows, or any impact to future value.\n\nOrigin benefitted from a record cash distribution from Australia Pacific LNG of $1,595 million, due to higher realised oil and spot LNG prices. This distribution contributed to a strong free cash flow position of $1,062 million.\n\nAdjusted net debt reduced by $1,801 million to $2,838 million, as strong cash flow and proceeds from the sale of a 10 per cent interest in Australia Pacific LNG enabled Origin to pay down debt, invest in growth and deliver returns to shareholders, including a $250 million share buyback.\n\nThe board has determined a partly franked final dividend of 16.5 cents per share. Shareholders received total dividends of 29 cents per share in FY2022.",

        "page_content": "## Operational performance\n\nIn Integrated Gas, Australia Pacific LNG's performance was strong. Reserves increased significantly due to higher estimated recoveries from producing fields, and revenue rose sharply on the strength of higher global commodity prices. Australia Pacific LNG continued to be a major provider of gas to the domestic market. Integrated Gas Underlying EBITDA was $1,837 million, up 62 per cent on the previous year.\n\nIn Energy Markets, earnings were impacted by high commodity prices and domestic supply interruptions, combined with volatile wholesale electricity prices, higher fuel costs and wet weather. Underlying EBITDA for Energy Markets of $365 million was 63 per cent lower than the prior year.\n\nDespite the challenging conditions, there were several highlights in Energy Markets. Our customer base grew to 4.5 million, as 193,000 new accounts were added through the acquisition of WINconnect and a doubling in Broadband customers. Our domestic gas business also performed strongly.\n\nOur new retail operating model and migration of customers to Kraken is progressing well, with more than half of Origin's electricity and gas customer accounts now on the platform. We are on target for completion by December 2022 and have achieved $170 million of a targeted total of $200 - $250 million in cash cost savings by FY2024, from an FY2018 baseline.\n\nOrigin's investment in Octopus Energy continues to exceed expectations, as it successfully navigated very challenging market conditions, emerging as the UK's fifth largest retailer and better positioned to deliver on its ambitious growth strategy.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThere remains uncertainty around the range of potential earnings outcomes for FY2023. Underlying earnings are expected to be higher, driven by growth in earnings from the gas business, while electricity gross profit is expected to remain supressed. Risk of coal under-delivery remains, including due to rail and mine performance. We will continue to assess the outlook for the business with a view to providing an update when there is less uncertainty.\n\nIn FY2024, we anticipate further growth in underlying earnings. The magnitude of this growth is dependent on fuel and energy prices and the extent to which these are reflected in customer tariffs, the outcome of a price review on ~50 petajoules of gas supply, and delivery of targeted retail savings.\n\nAustralia Pacific LNG production for FY2023 is expected to be 680 - 710 petajoules, reflecting ongoing strong field performance and allowing for the impact of recent wet weather events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board and people\n\nWhile there were fewer serious injuries recorded in FY2022, disappointingly, safety performance declined, with our total recordable injury frequency rate increasing to 4.0, from 2.7 in FY2021. We have further intensified our focus on safety programs to help address this decline and continue to target a zeroharm workplace.\n\nWe continued to engage widely with our stakeholders and contribute meaningfully to the communities in which we operate, increasing regional procurement, indigenous employment, workforce diversity and announcing our support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart.\n\nWe were pleased to welcome Dr Nora Scheinkestel to the Board as an Independent Non-executive Director. Dr Scheinkestel has deep financial expertise and extensive experience as a director of leading ASX listed companies.\n\nIn conclusion, at a time of incredible change for our sector, we have taken steps to put Origin in a stronger position to navigate the energy transition and create value for shareholders. We recognise the energy transition is not without its challenges for society, and we must continue to work to get the balance right between emissions reduction, and energy security, reliability and affordability. Our fundamental belief is that the transition will be good for our business, customers and the planet.\n\nWe hope you share our optimism for the future and look forward to welcoming you to this year's Annual General Meeting.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott Perkins Chairman\n\nFrank Calabria\n\nChief Executive Officer",

As the global economy emerged from the pandemic, demand for oil, coal and natural gas rebounded and this caused the price of these commodities to rise. This was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which impacted the global supply of these commodities, and saw prices rapidly escalate to extremely high levels. These high prices have persisted.\n\nIn addition to global factors, Australia's gas and electricity markets were impacted by a number of domestic/local factors. There was a shortage of power in the National Electricity Market, due to very high levels of planned and unplanned coal power plant outages, coal supply interruptions, and the La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern dampening renewables output, which also coincided with an early cold snap to start winter. This saw the NEM wholesale price of electricity average $276/MWh in the June 2022 quarter, approximately three times the price over the same period in the prior year. Gas prices also soared more than three fold over the same period, as substantially more gas was needed for gas fired power generation, to cover the supply constraints in the electricity market.\n\nThe unprecedented supply challenges and price volatility had a significant impact on the energy market. Five smaller retailers were unable to continue supplying electricity to their customers at higher prices and failed, with Origin acting as a Retailer of Last Resort in certain geographic areas for some of these retailers, alongside other large retailers.\n\nOil price - Brent (US$/bbl)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNSW electricity price ($/MWh)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Increased electricity supply from large and small-scale renewable energy is expected to put downward pressure on average electricity prices over time.\n\nThe growth in renewables will be supported by underwriting arrangements from governments and corporates with decarbonisation objectives. For example, the Australian Government is supporting the transition to cleaner energy, aiming to achieve 82 per cent renewables in the electricity market by 2030.\n\nThe increase in renewables will in turn increase the need for reliable, dispatchable capacity such as flexible gas-fired generation and battery storage at times of peak demand and lower renewable generation.\n\nElectricity markets are expected to remain competitive. Customers are increasingly looking for lower carbon solutions as homes and businesses become more connected. Customers are becoming more empowered, managing their energy requirements in partnership with retailers such as Origin.\n\nElectricity prices for customers are expected to increase in FY2024 before reducing in mid 2020s as new sources of renewable electricity supply put downward pressure on prices. There is also potential for further government intervention in the market should volatility and higher prices threaten energy security and affordability.\n\nWe expect international and domestic gas prices to remain high given the current global supply constraints. Pressures on the domestic gas market will ease as more coal baseload generation comes back online reducing the domestic demand for gas. We further expect the LNG industry on the east coast, including our own APLNG project, to continue to meet domestic gas demand.\n\n## Energy Policy Reform\n\nThe existing energy system has a critical role to play over the coming years as Australia transitions to renewable energy. Policy reform is urgently required to ensure the existing energy system performs reliably as it is needed to support this transition. New investment is also required in renewable energy, firming generation and transmission to underpin the new energy system. Gas is needed to play a critical role in firming renewables but requires a clear market signal to do so. The right market settings can accelerate the transition away from coal and towards renewables and maintain reliability for customers.\n\nPolicy reform must address the lack of price incentives for reliable generation capacity. Origin supports the development of a well-designed capacity mechanism that would allow for the application of a consistent national framework that would provide the incentive to get the investment needed to help safeguard reliability at least cost as the market transitions. A capacity mechanism could have an overall positive impact by helping to stimulate investment in new supply. Importantly, the capacity mechanism should not be viewed as a means of staving off coal closures, but to work alongside a credible framework to help facilitate and manage orderly exits.\n\nIt is crucial the capacity mechanism is designed to complement the existing energy-only framework. This would reduce any disruption, complexity, and ultimately costs in adopting the scheme, by building on the strengths of the National Energy Market's current design.",

We are committed to providing 'good energy' that is reliable, affordable and sustainable. In FY2022, we:\n\n- \u00b7 supported residential and small business customers in financial distress due to COVID-19, and the floods in New South Wales and Queensland;\n- \u00b7 continued to support customers in our Power On hardship program;\n- \u00b7 increased the number of customer accounts across our GreenPower, Green Gas, Green LPG and Origin Go Zero products to 340,000, up from 260,000 in FY2021;\n- \u00b7 continued to migrate customers accounts to the Kraken platform, with 2.2 million successfully migrated as at 30 June 2022;\n- \u00b7 supported the domestic east coast gas market through our APLNG business; and\n- \u00b7 launched Origin Zero, our business unit dedicated to supporting our large business customers on their decarbonisation journey.\n\n## Getting energy right for our communities\n\nWe respect the rights and interests of the communities in which we operate, and consult with them to understand and manage our impact.\n\nWe spent $318 million directly and indirectly with regional suppliers, or 20 per cent of our total spend, up from 18 per cent in FY2021.\n\nOur Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (Stretch RAP) includes a commitment to increase the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses in Origin's supply chain. In FY2022, our spend with Indigenous suppliers was up $7 million to $17 million, bringing our cumulative spend under our three-year Stretch RAP to $32.6 million.\n\nWe continue to work closely with the Northern Land Council to engage with our Native Title holders in the Beetaloo Basin. During the year, we appointed a Native Title holder as a Community Liaison Officer to provide ongoing engagement with the local community about our activities. We also undertook meetings on Country to explain our upcoming work program and sacred site clearance and avoidance surveys of our potential future work areas.\n\nThrough grants, 7,000 hours of employee volunteering, and our workplace giving program, the Origin Energy Foundation contributed over $2.6 million to the community in FY2022.\n\nWe also committed to a $5 million community fund as part of our support for the community as we transition out of coal-fired generation at the Eraring Power Station.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continued to change the way we work in response to COVID-19, strengthening Origin's culture during this time. During FY2022, we:\n\n- \u00b7 reduced Tier 1 and Tier 2 Process Safety Events to two, from 11 in FY2021;\n- \u00b7 completed the roll out of our Life Saving Controls program at operational sites;\n- \u00b7 announced support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart;\n- \u00b7 ranked in the top 10 in Australia in Equileap's 2022 Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking;\n- \u00b7 awarded \"Gold employer status\" at the Australian LGBTQ Inclusion Awards;\n- \u00b7 received an engagement score down 6 per cent to 68 per cent, remains 7 per cent above the Australia and New Zealand energy industry average; and\n- \u00b7 grew our Indigenous talent base, from 35 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees at the beginning of our Stretch RAP in FY2018 to 73 at the end of FY2022.\n\nRegrettably our TRIFR deteriorated during the year due to the additional constraints wet weather and COVID-19 placed on our field based employees and contractors. We undertook a safety stand down to assess these field based injuries and continue to focus on providing a safe work environment for all of our people.\n\nOur COVID-19 response included extensive workplace health controls, including testing in specific situations, a temporary COVID-19 Vaccination Policy and detailed social distancing and hygiene controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2021, Origin became a signatory to 40:40 Vision , an investor-led initiative targeting gender balance in executive leadership by 2030. Under the initiative, we have committed to achieving gender balance (40:40:20) in executive leadership by 2030.\n\nWe continue to focus on supporting the mental health and well being of our people and to develop a range of resources and programs through our online Mental Health and Wellbeing Hub.",

High electricity and gas prices meant the hedge transactions that we use to manage price risk significantly increased in value. This increase in hedge value resulted in a requirement to recognise an impairment in the underlying business assets which in no way reflects the performance or future value of the business.\n\nFY2022 was characterised by unprecedented volatility and elevated prices in global and domestic energy markets. Underlying Profit was higher at $407 million with higher earnings from Integrated Gas and lower earnings from Energy Markets. Earnings from Integrated Gas increased despite the sale of 10 per cent of APLNG during the period.\n\nEnergy Markets earnings were adversely impacted during the period by a material contracted coal supply disruption to the Eraring Power Station at a time of high spot electricity prices. Low retail tariffs were set at a time of low customer demand during COVID-19, adding to the challenges faced by the electricity business. Our natural gas business performed well with increased earnings primarily driven by rising market prices reflected in higher trading sales.\n\nAPLNG delivered stable production despite a significant increase in wet weather and well flooding events. APLNG delivered 132 cargoes, up from 130 cargoes in the prior period, including 15 spot cargoes, as well as delivering additional gas to the domestic market during a period of downstream maintenance and in response to high customer demand in Q4 FY2022. APLNG's realised oil price of US$74/bbl, up from US$43/bbl in FY2021 meant that a record cash distribution was paid to Origin.\n\nFree Cash Flow was up $32 million at $1,062 million, driven by record cash distributions from APLNG of $1,595 million partially offset by lower earnings from Energy Markets. This as well as $1,957 million from the sale of 10 per cent of Australia Pacific LNG enabled debt reduction of $1,801 million while allowing for investment in growth, dividends to shareholders and a $250 million on market share buy-back.\n\nOur partnership with Octopus to transform our retail operations is progressing well, with more than 2.2 million customer accounts migrated to the Kraken platform. An additional $80 million in FY2022 and $163 million in August 2022 were invested to restore our 20 per cent interest.\n\nThe Board has determined to pay 16.5 cent per share dividend franked to 75% bringing total distributions for the year to 29 cents per share.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These conditions culminated with periods of administered wholesale electricity pricing and a temporary electricity spot market suspension in June.\n\nThe Electricity business began the year in a strong position to manage these conditions; however, a material coal supply disruption to our only coal-fired generation plant, Eraring, at a time of high spot electricity prices resulted in significantly higher energy procurement costs. Low retail tariffs added to the unfavourable market conditions, with tariffs set during FY2021 when wholesale prices were at low levels due to COVID-19. This resulted in a $692 million reduction in the Electricity Gross Profit.\n\nDuring June, strong support was received from coal suppliers, rail network providers and the NSW Government to increase rail deliveries which uplifted Eraring's output. Coal contracting for FY2023 is progressing and is now more than halfway towards our purchase target of 5 to 6 million tonnes.\n\nNatural Gas Gross Profit increased by $117 million, driven by higher short-term trading gas sales and repricing of customer tariffs, partly offset by higher procurement costs. Our portfolio is underpinned by fixed-price 2 supply contracts and is well placed heading into a tightening market. The JKM supply position is fully hedged at favourable rates to current market prices and there are no further price reviews on supply contracts until FY2024.\n\nWe are committed to relieving the pricing impacts on customers where possible. Our principle is to hold FY2023 prices flat for our most vulnerable hardship customers who are on the Power On program, and we absorbed some higher energy costs to make sure that most of our customers are at or below the DMO and VDO, post product benefits such as market discounts and Solar FiT.\n\nCustomer accounts increased by 193,000 3 , including the acquisition of WINconnect, which added 99,000 customer accounts. Our Broadband business grew by 28,000 to 61,000 customer accounts and was named Australia's best-rated NBN provider of 2022 by Canstar Blue.\n\nOur investment in Octopus continues to exceed expectations. Octopus emerged from the recent UK energy crisis with 43 per cent more customer accounts, and is now the fifth largest UK retailer with around 15 per cent market share. This has demonstrated the significant advantage of Octopus' low-cost operating model and market-leading Kraken platform in a rapidly changing energy landscape. We have migrated more than 2.2 million customer accounts to the Kraken platform and remain on track to achieve the targeted cash cost benefits.\n\nOur ambition is to lead the energy transition to net zero emissions through cleaner energy and customer solutions. We have established the Origin Zero business to provide innovative low and zero carbon energy solutions to our customers. We also acquired the large-scale Yarrabee Solar Farm development project and received NSW Government development approval for the Eraring large-scale battery.\n\n- 1 12-month average.

Integrated Gas EBITDA was up $702 million to $1,837 million and APLNG's cash distributions to Origin were up $886 million to $1,595 million.\n\nRecord earnings were primarily driven by realised oil prices at APLNG increasing from US$43/bbl (A$58/bbl) in FY2021 to US$74/bbl (A$103/bbl) in FY2022. Reflecting the high oil price environment, hedge losses at Origin increased from a gain of $55 million in FY2021 to a loss of $189 million in FY2022.\n\nStrong field performance and operational efficiencies enabled APLNG to maintain stable production despite a significant increase in wet weather and associated well flooding events. Well availability was stable at around 90 per cent in FY2022, with the wet weather impacts offset by implementation of new technology that reduced well defects and failures. High upstream gas processing facility reliability and improved performance from network infrastructure, driven by investment in prior periods enabled high utilisation of upstream gas processing capacity.\n\nDuring the period, APLNG delivered 132 LNG cargoes (up from 130 cargoes in FY2021) including 15 spot cargoes. APLNG also continued to supply significant volumes into the domestic market, directing additional gas during June 2022 when the market was experiencing particularly high demand.\n\nOperating expenses in APLNG increased, primarily due to higher power costs and higher royalties on the higher revenue base.\n\nOrigin announced the sale of a 10 per cent interest in APLNG to ConocoPhillips on 8 December 2021, delivering net proceeds of $2 billion after adjustments. Origin retains a 27.5 per cent shareholding in the joint venture and continues the role of upstream operator .\n\nA scheduled price review with an LNG customer was successfully completed in early FY2023, with no material impact on Origin's earnings.\n\nAPLNG 2P (proved plus probable) reserves increased 901 PJ before production, representing reserves replacement of 116 per cent, driven by higher estimated recoveries from producing fields.

Our portfolio of coal and gas generation plants, renewable energy power purchase agreements and market supply and hedge contracts provides us with the flexibility to manage energy procurement costs. As we sell more energy than we generate, we have the ability to build or contract renewable energy and storage as the price of renewable energy becomes more competitive.\n\nIn natural gas, Origin's wholesale margin is driven by a strong gas supply portfolio, with pipeline and storage flexibility enabling us to direct gas to where it is most needed. A large portion of supply is under long-term contracts that are either fixed-price 6 or linked to oil and LNG spot prices. Some of our contracts reprice to market over time.\n\nProfitability in energy retailing is driven by managing retail margins through matching retail tariffs with energy procurement costs combined with an efficient, low cost operation and the ability to attract and retain customers through providing a superior customer experience. We are implementing the Kraken retail system which we believe will further lower our cost base and improve customer service.\n\nWe own 20 per cent of Octopus Energy 7 , a UK-based fast-growing energy technology company. Octopus owns the Kraken technology platform which is licensing around the world. Octopus is the fifth-largest energy retailer in the UK.\n\nOrigin is the upstream operator and has a 27.5 per cent interest in APLNG, reduced from 37.5 per cent following the sale of a 10 per cent stake during the year, which is Australia's largest CSG to LNG project. It is a significant supplier to both domestic gas and international LNG markets, with the majority of volume contracted until approximately 2035. Profitability is underpinned by maintaining a low capital and operating cost base relative to revenues, much of which are linked to oil prices. In FY2022, around 76 per cent of APLNG gas volume was sold as LNG (of which 89 per cent was under long-term oil-linked contracts).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are targeting a $200 - 250 million cash cost reduction from FY2018 baseline by FY2024\n- \u00b7 increasing the breadth of products purchased from us including broadband, solar, batteries, connected solutions and E-mobility\n- \u00b7 using strong data analytics capability to enable personalised and segmented offers and experiences for customers\n\nFor our larger business customers, we are working to simplify the energy transition, providing tailored energy and decarbonisation solutions through Origin Zero. These solutions can include elements such as renewable energy, demand response, solar, batteries, renewables, energy management and electric vehicle fleet management.\n\nThrough our Octopus Energy investment, we have access to an industry-leading retail platform to deliver the lowest costs and market-leading customer happiness, as well as exposure to Octopus's global growth.\n\n## Accelerate renewables and cleaner energy\n\nWe will invest in clean energy positions to support our customers' demand for energy and decarbonisation solutions. We will increase our renewable energy supply through new investments, partnerships, and projects, targeting multi-GW renewable growth opportunities through a staged and disciplined investment or contracting approach.\n\nIn addition to our significant gas peaking generation portfolio, we will invest in growing our \"firming capacity\" to support the growth of renewables during periods of peak demand and lower renewable generation. We have developed a proprietary Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform to connect and use artificial intelligence to orchestrate distributed assets. We are also growing our battery storage portfolio options with our first opportunity being the potential development of a 460MW stage 1 battery at Eraring.\n\nWe are investigating opportunities to invest in cleaner fuels for harder-to-abate sectors, including domestic and export green hydrogen projects, targeting domestic green hydrogen supply from the mid 2020s and export supply from the late 2020s.\n\n## Deliver reliable energy through the transition\n\nWe have a valuable portfolio of assets that play a critical role in providing customers with reliable and affordable energy as we transition to a low-carbon future. We believe gas will remain a key part of the energy mix during the transition.\n\nThrough our 27.5 per cent interest in APLNG, we continue to be low cost supplier of gas, for domestic and export customers. Any development associated with APLNG or our other upstream growth assets would only be done in a manner consistent with our decarbonisation commitments.\n\nOur Eraring coal fired power station continues to support the reliability and security of the electricity market. We have announced the potential early retirement of Eraring from 2025 as our portfolio and the market transitions to cleaner sources of energy and new sources of supply enter the market. We continue to investigate opportunities at the Eraring site for further clean energy developments, including batteries.\n\nOur existing thermal peaking generation will continue to play a critical role in providing capacity and firming as coal generators such as Eraring retire and are replaced by intermittent renewables.\n\nWe have a leading domestic wholesale gas position with the ability to transport gas across the east coast to support our gas fired generation fleet as well as residential, business and wholesale customers.",

Ongoing volatility in market conditions is likely and may adversely impact operations.\n\n|                                          |       | FY22   | FY23 guidance   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-----------------|\n| Integrated Gas - APLNG 100%              |       |        |                 |\n| Production                               | PJ    | 693    | 680 - 710       |\n| Capex and opex, excluding purchases 1    | A$b   | 2.2    | 2.5 - 2.7       |\n| Unit capex + opex, excluding purchases 1 | A$/GJ | 3.2    | 3.5 - 4.0       |\n\n## Integrated Gas\n\nWe estimate production in FY2023 of 680 - 710 PJ (APLNG 100 per cent), reflecting ongoing strong field performance and allowing for the impact of recent wet weather events.\n\nWe estimate total APLNG capex and opex of $2.5 - $2.7 billion , higher than FY2022, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure to elevated current power costs both through operated upstream operations and non-operated joint ventures;\n- \u00b7 Commencement of cyclical upstream major maintenance program on gas processing plants along with continuation of downstream cyclical LNG Train maintenance;\n- \u00b7 Increased workover activity as we target increased well availability, offsetting natural field decline to fill gas processing capacity; and\n- \u00b7 Increased well drilling activity to maintain current production levels.\n\nAt 2 August 2022, Origin estimates that approximately 43 per cent of APLNG's FY2023 JCC oil price exposure has been priced at US$108/bbl before hedging, based on the long-term LNG contract lags. Based on forward market prices as at 2 August 2022, we estimate losses in FY2023 on oil hedging of $290 million and LNG trading of $47 million. The LNG trading result remains subject to the spread between European and Asian gas prices, shipping costs and the allocation of cargos in the annual schedule. See Section 6.2.2 for details of Integrated Gas oil hedging and LNG trading.\n\n## Energy Markets\n\nThere remains a wide range of potential earnings outcomes in FY2023. We will continue to assess the outlook with a view to providing an update when there is less uncertainty.\n\nWe expect higher earnings in FY2023. Earnings from the gas business are expected to be higher on a largely fixed price 8 supply portfolio with no further price reviews on gas supply contracts until 1 July 2023. We expect electricity gross profit to remain supressed due to rising energy costs being only partially priced into regulated tariffs. Coal contracting is partially complete with 4.4 million tonnes now contracted of a target of 5 to 6 million tonnes. The contracted coal supplies are from both legacy priced contracts and contracts priced at market forward prices at the time of contracting. We remain exposed to risk of under-delivery including due to rail and mine performance. Cost to serve is expected to be relatively flat on FY2022, with Kraken benefits being offset by non-repeat of surplus COVID-19 provision release and investment in future portfolio growth.\n\nIn FY2024 we anticipate further growth in earnings. The magnitude of this growth is dependent on current forward prices being maintained and priced into regulated tariffs, and is subject to coal contracting risk and approximately 50 PJ gas price review outcomes. Octopus Energy is expected to deliver growth as global licensing revenue ramps up and the UK market stabilises. We expect Retail transformation to deliver on our commitment of $200 - $250 million cash cost reduction by FY2024, from an FY2018 baseline.",

These amounts are excluded from Underlying Profit to remove the volatility caused by timing mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying transactions they relate to.\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas derivatives manage exposure to fluctuations in the underlying commodity price to which Origin is exposed through its gas portfolio and indirectly through Origin's investment in APLNG. See Section 6.2.2 for details of Origin's APLNG-related oil hedging.\n- \u00b7 Electricity derivatives, including swaps, options and forward purchase contracts, are used to manage fluctuations in wholesale electricity and environmental certificate prices in respect of electricity purchased to meet customer demand.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives manage exposures associated with the debt portfolio. A portion of debt is eurodenominated and cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge that debt to AUD.\n- \u00b7 Other financial assets/liabilities reflects investments held by Origin.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange on foreign-denominated financing reflects currency fluctuations on unhedged USD debt.

At completion, the impairment reported within the Interim Report 2022 of $193 million was partially offset by a net gain of $80 million. The net gain comprises the release of $105 million benefit from the foreign currency translation reserve, partially offset by FX hedging costs and other completion adjustments amounting to $25 million. Refer to Note B2.1 of the Financial Statements for further information;\n- \u00b7 $172 million capital gains tax expense on divestment of 10 per cent share of APLNG, net of $222 million benefit from capital losses.

The costs associated with this deferral are expected to be recovered in future periods. Refer to Appendix for further details;\n- \u00b7 $39 million non-cash deferred tax expense, recognised net of the reversal of the booked amount to the divested share of APLNG, reflecting the expectation of higher future distributions from APLNG. Refer to Appendix for further details;\n- \u00b7 $34 million non-cash benefit relating to revaluation of the LNG onerous contract provisions, due to stronger near-term assumptions for LNG prices relative to Henry Hub prices and an increase in long-term assumptions for US Treasury bond rates.

Other non-cash expenses include provisions for bad and doubtful debts (+$65 million), share-based remuneration (+$29 million) and exploration expense (+$24 million).\n\nWorking capital moved favourably by $590 million in the period driven primarily by a favourable movement in futures exchange collateral.\n\nFutures exchange collateral relates to cash received from the futures exchange associated with in-the-money forward electricity hedge positions. FY2022 included $471 million of cash collateral received from the favourable movement in the value of open energy futures hedging contracts. The cash flows from favourable futures contracts and security deposits arose during a period of higher prices in domestic energy markets at the end of the financial year. Subsequent value movements will depend on forward energy prices.\n\nOther reflects the cash impact of items excluded from Underlying Profit, primarily the 2021 LGC shortfall charge.

This is prepared on the basis of equity accounting of APLNG. Specific items may be excluded from Free Cash Flow, to better represent cashflows from the underlying business. In FY2022 there was a significant cash inflow for futures exchange collateral which is expected to unwind. Proceeds from the sale of 10 per cent of APLNG were also excluded.\n\nIn FY2022, consistent with previous years, cash payments associated with the Octopus Energy equity investment and Kraken licence implementation costs ($318 million) were considered to be Major Growth and were excluded from FY2022 Free Cash Flow.\n\n|                                       | Energy Markets   | Energy Markets   | Integrated Gas -

The dividend will be franked to 75 per cent. This brings Origin's total distributions to shareholders for FY2022 to 29 cents per share, representing 47 per cent of Free Cash Flow. The final dividend will be paid on 30 September to shareholders registered as at 7 September 2022.\n\nDuring the period, $318 million was incurred in respect of the investment in Octopus Energy and the costs associated with the Kraken system implementation. This has been treated as major growth expenditure and excluded from Free Cash Flow when measuring the dividend pay-out percentage.\n\nAs the company has returned to a tax paying position, we expect future dividends to be either fully or partially franked.\n\nOrigin will seek to deliver sustainable shareholder returns through the business cycle and will target a payout range of 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Free Cash Flow per annum in the form of ordinary dividends. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities and investing activities (excluding major growth projects), less interest paid. Remaining cash flow will be applied to further debt reduction, value accretive organic growth and acquisition opportunities, and/or additional capital management initiatives.\n\nThe dividend payout ratio of 47 per cent is within the 30 per cent to 50 per cent target range as Free Cash Flow during the period, with Free Cash Flow adjusted for both the proceeds from the sale of the 10 per cent stake in APLNG and a large in-the-money collateral position on electricity futures hedge contracts. This collateral position is expected to reverse in future periods as the hedge contracts settle.\n\nThe Board maintains discretion to adjust shareholder distributions for economic and business conditions.\n\nGiven the Company's continued focus on capital management, the Board has taken the decision to suspend the dividend reinvestment plan until further notice.",

Operating cash flow of $531 million included $471 million of cash collateral received from the favourable movement in the value of open energy futures hedging contracts. The amount of the futures exchange collateral received was partially offset by a financing cash outflow of $290 million for cash security deposits placed with AEMO to support Origin's energy purchases from national electricity and gas markets.\n\nPurchase of shares on market includes the $250 million on-market share buyback, and shares purchased to meet employee share remuneration programs and the DRP.\n\nForeign exchange/other primarily reflects the non-cash translation of unhedged USD debt and fees ($104 million), operator cash call movements ($88 million), repayment of APLNG loan ($51 million and settlement of foreign currency contracts ($46 million).\n\nOrigin aims to maintain an Adjusted Net Debt/Adjusted Underlying EBITDA ratio of 2.0 - 3.0x and a gearing 10 target of 20 per cent to 30 per cent. At 30 June 2022, these ratios were 1.9x and 22 per cent respectively, reflecting the sale of a 10 per cent interest in APLNG during the year with the proceeds applied to debt reduction, distributions from APLNG of $1,595 million and favourable working capital movement associated with futures exchange collateral.\n\nOur long-term credit profile is Baa2 (stable) from Moody's.",

The average interest rate on drawn debt remained unchanged at 4.3 per cent for both FY2021 and FY2022.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, Origin held $0.6 billion 11 of cash and $2.7 billion in committed undrawn debt facilities. This liquidity position of $3.3 billion is held to meet near-term debt and lease liability payment obligations of $0.3 billion and to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer.\n\n## APLNG funding\n\nDuring construction of APLNG, shareholders contributed capital via\n\nordinary equity and the investment in preference shares (termed MRCPS) issued by APLNG. APLNG distributed funds to shareholders firstly via fixed dividends of 6.37 per cent per annum on the MRCPS balance, recognised as interest income by Origin, and secondly via buy-backs of MRCPS (refer to Section 5.3 above). The MRCPS were entirely bought back in the year ended 30 June 2022 and subsequent distributions from APLNG during the year were received via unfranked dividends ($433 million).\n\nAPLNG also funded construction via US$8.5 billion (APLNG 100 per cent) in project finance facilities. These facilities were partially refinanced in FY2019. The outstanding balance at 30 June 2022 was US$5,410 million (A$7,851 million), net of unamortised debt fees of US$51 million (A$74 million).

Unit fuel costs increased from $47.9/MWh to $68.2/MWh, driven by higher coal costs as the material under-delivery of contracted coal from our primary supplier resulted in coal purchases at significantly higher prices. High electricity spot prices and colder weather towards the end of FY2022 also resulted in increased gas generation, with gas purchased at high market prices;\n- - -$124 million due to higher electricity procurement costs, largely reflecting higher unit net pool costs which increased from $45.5/MWh to $99.2/MWh, and higher volumes of market contracts. Lower output from Eraring due to coal supply disruption required replacement electricity purchased in the spot and contract markets;\n- - These higher costs were partially offset by lower cost of capacity hedge contracts as more expensive legacy contracts rolled off, lower unit cost of market contracts due to the timing of the sale and purchase of swaps, and lower bundled renewable PPA costs with Stockyard Hill volumes replacing more expensive legacy contracts;\n- - -$325 million related to lower wholesale prices flowing into customer tariffs, which were set during FY2021 with a period of low wholesale prices due to the impacts of COVID-19; and\n- - +$71 million from improved value management (+$48 million), recovery of FY2021 network costs (+$37 million), partially offset by metering costs under recovered (-$14 million).\n- \u00b7 Volumes increased 1.9 TWh, reflecting a 2.3 TWh increase in business volumes, partially offset by a 0.3 TWh decrease in retail volumes, with a +$1 million impact to Gross Profit. Higher business volumes are driven by net customer wins, and lower residential demand largely reflecting continued uptake in solar and energy efficiency.\n\n## Sources and uses of electricity (TWh)\n\n40\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOwned and contracted generation output of 18.7 TWh was lower by 1.7 TWh, primarily driven by lower Eraring output (-2.3 TWh) due to coal supply constraints. Gas generation was higher (+0.3 TWh) primarily to offset lower coal generation. Generation from renewable PPAs increased (+0.3 TWh) largely due to Stockyard Hill volumes received while ramping up production.

Churn rates increased driven by volatile and high wholesale electricity prices, causing some smaller energy retailers to either exit the market or offer uncompetitive prices to their customers.\n\nPeriod end customer accounts increased by 193,000 overall, including recording 39,000 previously excluded electricity unmetered sites due to an industry change. Excluding the addition of the electricity unmetered sites, electricity customer accounts increased by 69,000 reflecting gains across all states. Natural Gas customer accounts increased by 29,000, driven primarily by gains in New South Wales. The addition of around 7,000 customer accounts was due to the Retailer of Last Resort (ROLR) events 14 that occurred from May 2022 until the end of FY2022.\n\nWINconnect acquisition added 99,000 customer accounts to the CES business.

The main focus areas continue to be the expansion of Origin Loop (our in-house Virtual Power Plant) and the deployment of digital products and services to our customers that reflect the continued shift towards a distributed and data-driven energy landscape.\n\nAssets connected to Loop have grown from 159 MW to 258 MW during FY2022, including an increasing variety of distributed assets, which are aggregated, controlled and dispatched in response to market and portfolio positions, improving customer engagement while reducing energy costs for both customers and Origin.\n\nOf the 121,000 connected services, more than 75,000 are from our Spike program, an increase of around 30 per cent in the past 12 months. Spike is a behavioural demand response program that rewards customers for reducing energy usage during periods of peak market demand called SpikeHour. It has proven to be very engaging with customers, with more than 2.6 million SpikeHour invitations since the launch in August 2020, with a participation rate of 69 per cent and total energy reduction of 342 MWh during the SpikeHour. We have also deployed in-app solar and battery features that provide customers with powerful insights on how they use and manage energy in their homes.\n\nOperating costs increased during the period, largely due to scaling of Loop, batteries and demand response offerings.\n\nOther income in the period related to distributions received from equity investments.",

Origin invested an additional approximately $80 million (\u00a343 million) in FY2022 and $163 million (\u00a394 million) in August 2022 to restore its 20 per cent interest.\n\nOrigin's share of Octopus Energy EBITDA for the period was a loss of $36 million, a reduction of $33 million from FY2021. This was largely driven by unprecedented UK market conditions in FY2022 which saw about 28 UK energy retailers exit the market since the start of September 2021, displacing close to 6 million customers. Octopus' wholesale risk management approach largely shielded the company from the market volatility, though they incurred a higher cost of energy during extreme wholesale prices with an inability to pass this cost on to customers due to the lag in the reset of regulated tariffs. Octopus' operating costs increased driven by the scale up of labour to support the growth in licensing, energy services and international retail businesses.\n\nOctopus added around 1 million Avro Energy customer accounts under the regulator's Retailer of Last Resort (ROLR) scheme and launched in the Italian and French markets. Customer accounts in the underlying UK retail business have grown to 6 million at the end of June 2022, a 43 per cent increase in the past 12 months and Octopus is now the fifth largest UK retailer. This has demonstrated the significant advantage of Octopus' low-cost operating model, prudent risk management approach and market-leading Kraken platform in a rapidly changing energy landscape.\n\nIn November 2021, Octopus announced a licensing deal with EDF, the fourth largest UK energy supplier, to move its 5 million customers to Kraken from 2023. Following this deal, four of the UK's leading energy suppliers will be on the Kraken platform. Licensing deals with E.ON and Origin are progressing well, with all of E.ON's 8.7 million customer accounts migrated and 2.2 million customer accounts from Origin now on the Kraken platform.",

APLNG operates Australia's largest CSG to LNG export project (by nameplate capacity) with the country's largest 2P CSG reserves 17 .\n\nOrigin is the operator of the upstream CSG exploration and appraisal, development and production activities. ConocoPhillips is the operator of the 9 mtpa two-train LNG liquefaction facility at Gladstone in Queensland.\n\nAs APLNG is an equity accounted incorporated joint venture, Integrated Gas reports its share of APLNG EBITDA. The share of APLNG ITDA is recorded as a line item between EBITDA and EBIT.\n\nAPLNG acquired various CSG interests from Tri-Star in 2002 that are subject to reversionary rights and an ongoing royalty interest in favour of Tri-Star. These interests represent approximately 20 per cent of APLNG's 2P CSG reserves and approximately 20 per cent of 3P (proved plus probable plus possible) CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2022). Refer to Section 8 for disclosure relating to Tri-Star litigation associated with these CSG interests.\n\n## Financial summary - APLNG\n\n|                                      | FY22       | FY22            | FY21       | FY21         |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|\n| ($m)                                 | APLNG 100% | Origin share 16 | APLNG 100% | Origin share |\n| Commodity revenue and other income 1 | 9,362      | 2,903           | 4,595      | 1,723        |\n| Operating expenses                   | (2,486)    | (768)           | (1,544)    | (578)        |\n| Underlying EBITDA                    | 6,876      | 2,134           | 3,051      | 1,145        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation        | (1,563)    | (495)           | (1,568)    | (588)        |\n| MRCPS interest expense               | (141)      | (48)            | (282)      | (106)        |\n| Project finance interest expense     | (261)      | (82)            | (270)      | (101)        |\n| Other financing expense              | (67)       | (23)            | (87)       | (33)         |\n| Interest income                      | 9          | 3               | 6          | 2            |\n| Income tax expense                   | (1,456)    | (445)           | (255)      | (95)         |\n| Underlying ITDA 2                    | (3,479)    | (1,090)         | (2,456)    | (921)        |\n| Underlying Profit                    | 3,397      | 1,044           | 595        | 224          |\n\n- 1 Includes commodity revenue plus other income of $29 million (Origin share) primarily related to Woleebee asset sale (FY2021: $16 million Origin share).\n- 2 See Note B2.2 of the Financial Statements for details relating to a $4 million difference between APLNG ITDA and Origin's reported share.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The North Asian LNG prices delivered in FY2022 averaged approximately US$26/MMbtu compared with US$7/MMbtu in FY2021.\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses increased by $353 18 million, driven by higher royalties as a result of higher revenue, along with higher electricity costs. See below for further details.\n- \u00b7 The change in ownership from December 2021 reduced Origin's share of APLNG's EBITDA by $444 million compared to maintaining a 37.5 per cent stake for the full year.\n\nThe change in ownership is also the primary driver of the reduction in Origin's share of depreciation and amortisation of $93 million and project finance interest expense of $19 million. MRCPS were fully repaid during the period, leading to a reduction in MRCPS interest expense of $58 million.",

As a result of the sale, from 8 December 2021 Origin holds 27.5 per cent ownership in APLNG which continues to be equity accounted\n\nStrong operated field performance and operational efficiencies offset lower production from Spring Gully legacy wells, natural field decline in certain non-operated fields and wet weather impacts, resulting in stable production compared to the prior period.\n\nAPLNG sales volumes increased 1 per cent, reflecting more volumes lifted from non-operated fields and portfolio management via time swaps, which allows for effective management of upstream gas production during periods of LNG plant outages.\n\nThe average realised LNG price increased 110 per cent to A$16.36/GJ driven by higher realised oil prices, and higher spot LNG volumes and prices. The average realised domestic gas price increased 47 per cent to $6.23/GJ, primarily driven by market-linked short-term contract prices.",

Distributable cash flow represents the net increase in cash, including foreign exchange movements before MRCPS interest and buy-backs, and transactions with shareholders.\n\nAPLNG generated distributable cash flow of $5,850 million in FY2022 at an effective oil price of US$74/bbl, up from $1,721 million at an effective oil price of US$43/bbl in the prior year. Cash distributions to Origin were $1,595 million in FY2022 up from $709 million in the prior year. The distribution Origin received comprised redemption of MRCPS and associated interest of $1,162 million, and unfranked ordinary dividends of $433 million. The project finance facility requires APLNG to hold an amount of cash to service near-term operational and project finance obligations. As at 30 June 2022, APLNG held $1,544 million of cash, up from $905 million at 30 June 2021 reflecting higher commodity prices in the last quarter of FY2022 compared with the last quarter of FY2021.",

At breakeven price, royalties and tariffs would have amounted to $175 million (FY2021: $147 million).\n\nOperating expenses increased $942 million, primarily driven by higher royalties and tariffs ($604 million), reflecting stronger commodity prices. Higher purchases was associated with portfolio management via time swaps supporting sales during upstream maintenance periods ($103 million). Upstream operated opex increased $168 million mainly due to increased electricity costs with 24 per cent of APLNG's FY2022 electricity costs on a floating price, and a higher number of major workovers completed. Upstream non-operated opex increased $46 million, also driven by higher electricity costs. Downstream opex increased $88 million primarily reflecting the 31-day planned Train 1 major maintenance activity conducted early in the year. APLNG Corporate/other reduced by $67 million, primarily due to favourable FX revaluation of USD cash balances.\n\n## Capital expenditure - APLNG 100%\n\n|                                    | FY22 ($m)   | FY21 ($m)   | Change ($m)   | Change (%)   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Operated upstream - Sustain        | (202)       | (285)       | 83            | (29)         |\n| Operated upstream - Infrastructure | (29)        | (11)        | (18)          | 166          |\n| Exploration and appraisal          | (35)        | (23)        | (12)          | 50           |\n| Downstream                         | (23)        | (14)        | (9)           | 68           |\n| Non-operated                       | (131)       | (95)        | (36)          | 37           |\n| Total capital expenditure          | (421)       | (429)       | 8             | (2)          |\n\nCapital expenditure decreased $8 million, with an $83 million decrease in operated sustain costs, partially offset by increases across other areas. The reduction in operated sustain costs reflects reduced development activity in the period enabled by improved field performance as well as the impact of more wet weather in FY2022. Non-operated expenditure increased $36 million due to the commencement of Arcadia Phase 2 and Fairview development programs. Operated infrastructure costs increased $18 million primarily due to construction costs associated with the Talinga Condabri North Pipeline (TCNP), which was commissioned in July 2022, connecting gas fields to gas processing infrastructure with surplus capacity.\n\nOperated upstream - Sustain includes expenditure for drilling, completions, fracture stimulation, the gathering network, surface connection, capital improvements and land access which occurs over multiple years. In FY2022, 63 operated wells were drilled (versus 86 in FY2021), 23 wells were fracture stimulated (versus 18 in FY2021) and 65 operated wells were commissioned (versus 141 in FY2021).",

It also includes overhead costs (net of recoveries) incurred as upstream operator and corporate service provider to APLNG, costs associated with growth initiatives such as hydrogen, and costs incurred in managing Origin's exposure to LNG pricing risk and impacts of its LNG trading positions.\n\n## Beetaloo Basin (Northern Territory)\n\nOrigin has a 77.5 per cent interest in three exploration permits over 18,500 km 2 in the Beetaloo Basin. Stage 2 appraisal under the farm-in arrangement to evaluate three independent shale gas plays was completed in HY2022. Stage 3 is now underway, targeting the Velkerri dry gas play. Work continues with regulators and Native Title holders to ensure operations are conducted safely with transparency and consistent with necessary approvals and consents.\n\n- \u00b7 Velkerri dry gas play - A further production test of the Amungee NW 1H well was conducted in August 2021 to assess if stages that were stimulated during the previous test in 2016 are contributing to flow rates. Average gas flow rates of 1.02 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) were observed over a 45-day period, with between 85 per cent and 95 per cent of the flows measured coming from the first 200-metre section of the well. The test results suggest a normalised gas flow rate equivalent of between 5.2 and 5.8 MMscf/d per 1,000 metres of lateral. Future production wells will target effective lengths of approximately 3,000 metres. This result indicates the Velkerri dry gas play may be comparable with commercial shale plays around the world. The Stage 3 work programme includes drilling, hydraulic fracture stimulation and extended production test of two horizontal wells.\n- \u00b7 Velkerri liquids-rich gas play -The Velkerri 76 S2-1 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 2,129 metres in October 2021 with encouraging preliminary results, indicating that the Velkerri shales at this location are within the wet gas maturity window. The CY2022 work programme includes core sample analysis to further characterise the reservoir.\n- \u00b7 Kyalla liquids-rich gas play - A production test was conducted at the Kyalla 117 well during the period. The well was able to intermittently flow without assistance at rates up to 1.5 MMscf/d; however, production was not sustained and the well has been shut in. Kyalla 117 is the first horizontal well drilled targeting the Beetaloo Basin's Kyalla shale formation and successfully met its primary technical objective of demonstrating potential liquids-rich gas flows. The Stage 3 work programme includes further evaluation of the results of the Kyalla 117 well to better understand the issues encountered during testing in CY2021.\n\n## Cooper-Eromanga Basin (Queensland)\n\nOrigin has a 75 per cent interest and operatorship of five permits, 100 per cent interest and operatorship of one permit, and has 99 per cent interest and operatorship of additional 11 permits. In December 2020, the first vertical exploration well, Obelix-2, was drilled to test the maturity of the Toolebuc Formation. The well was written off in HY2022 with no plans for further development at the well location. Additional permits were acquired to continue the evaluation of the prospectivity of the Toolebuc formation within the basin, targeting both unconventional liquids and gas.\n\n## Canning Basin (Western Australia)\n\nOrigin entered into agreements in December 2020 with Buru Energy to farm in to a 50 per cent equity share in five permits, and a 40 per cent equity share in two permits. The Currajong 1 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 2,340 metres in August 2021 however no oil was recovered from the test zones, and the well was written off in HY2022. The Rafael 1 well was drilled to a total depth of 4,141 metres in November 2021, and a production test was conducted in March 2022 with gas successfully flowed to the surface. Initial analysis of the data collected during the test indicates encouraging gas composition with high condensate and low CO2 content. Further appraisal of Rafael will be required to understand materiality and commerciality.\n\n## Financial summary\n\n|                                               | FY22 ($m)   | FY21 ($m)   | Change ($m)   | Change (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Origin only commodity hedging and trading     | (189)       | 55          | (244)         | (441)        |\n| Other Origin only costs                       | (109)       | (65)        | (44)          | 67           |\n| Underlying EBITDA                             | (297)       | (10)        | (287)         | 2,870        |\n| Underlying depreciation and amortisation/ITDA | (20)        | (26)        | 6             | (22)         |\n| Interest income - MRCPS                       | 48          | 106         | (58)          | (55)         |\n| Underlying Profit/(Loss)                      | (268)       | 71          | (339)         | (477)        |\n\nRefer to the following table for a breakdown of Origin only commodity hedging and trading costs.\n\nOther Origin only costs increased $44 million, primarily reflecting write-off of wells in the Cooper and Canning Basins.",

As at 2 August 2022, we estimate that 43 per cent has been priced (based on LNG contract lags) at approximately US$108/bbl before any hedging.\n\nOrigin has separately hedged to provide downside protection (using 5.4 MMbbl of swaps and 1.6 MMbbl of producer collars) and subsequently executed 4.4 MMbbl of collars to re-participate in upside in a higher oil environment. As at 2 August 2022, the effective price on the realised hedging (3 MMbbl equivalent) was US$67/bbl (see table below). Based on forward oil price of US$94/bbl, the effective prices on the unrealised hedges would be US$64/bbl (2.4 MMbbl equivalent), which would result in an effective oil price for FY2023 of ~US$87/bbl including hedges.\n\nPremium spend for this hedge position is A$21 million, to be incurred in FY2023.\n\n|                                       | Realised as at 2 August 2022   | Realised as at 2 August 2022          | Remaining unrealised   | Remaining unrealised   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| FY2023 hedge instruments              | Volume (MMbbl)                 | Effective  realised price on  3 MMbbl | Volume (MMbbl)         | Average price          |\n| Brent USD swaps                       | 3.0                            | US$57/bbl                             | 2.4                    | US$55/bbl              |\n| Brent producer collars                | 0.4                            | -US$3/bbl                             | 1.2                    | US$35-90/bbl           |\n| Brent USD upside participation collar | 2.6                            | +US$13/bbl                            | 1.8                    | US$61-76/bbl           |\n| Net realised price                    |                                | US$67/bbl                             |                        |                        |\n\nThe FY2024 hedge position consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 2 MMbbl hedged at a fixed price of A$137/bbl,\n- \u00b7 0.8 MMbbl hedged at a floor price of US$35/bbl, with all of this hedged amount participating in market prices up to US$90/bbl.\n\nThe total premium spend for this hedge position is A$2 million to be incurred in FY2024.\n\n## LNG hedging and trading\n\nIn 2013, Origin established a Henry Hub linked contract to purchase 0.25 mtpa from Cameron LNG for a period of 20 years, with the first cargo delivered to Origin in June 2020.\n\nIn FY2020, a non-cash onerous provision of $641 million was recognised, which has been revalued to nil ($0m) as at 30 June 2022 ($397 million as at 30 June 2021), reflecting stronger near-term assumptions for LNG prices relative to Henry Hub prices, higher US Treasury bond rates and the realised gain for the period.\n\nIn 2016, Origin established a contract with ENN LNG Trading Company Limited to sell 0.28 mtpa on a Brent oil-linked basis commencing in FY2019 and ending in December 2023 to act as a partial hedge to the Cameron LNG contract. In FY2021, a non-cash onerous provision of $13 million was recognised, which has been revalued at $397 million as at 30 June 2022, reflecting stronger near-term assumptions for LNG prices relative to Brent oil prices.\n\nThese contracts and derivative hedge contracts that manage the price risk associated with the physical LNG contracts form part of an LNG trading portfolio.\n\nBased on market forward prices as at 2 August 2022, the FY2023 LNG trading loss is expected to be $47 million and remains subject to the spread between European and Asian gas prices, shipping costs and the allocation of cargos in the annual schedule. The increase in expected loss compared to FY2022 is primarily due to less favourable hedging rates achieved and higher shipping costs on physical deliveries.",

Material risks, and the Company's approach to managing them, are summarised below.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOverseen by the Board and the Board Risk Committee, Origin's risk management framework supports the identification, management and reporting of material risks. Risks are identified that have the potential to impact the delivery of business plans and objectives. Risks are assessed using a risk toolkit that considers the level of consequence and likelihood of occurrence using consistent risk assessment criteria.\n\nThe risk framework incorporates a \"three lines of defence\" model for managing risks and controls in areas such as health and safety, environment (including climate change), financial, reputation and brand, legal and compliance and social impacts. All employees are responsible for making risk-based decisions and managing risk within approved risk appetite and specific limits.\n\nThe Board reviews Origin's material risks each quarter and assesses the effectiveness of the Company's risk management framework annually in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n| Line of defence                 | Responsibility                                                                                   | Primary accountability                  |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| First line                      |                                                                                                  |                                         |\n| Lines of business               | Identifies, assesses, records, prioritises, manages and monitors risks.                          | Management                              |\n| Second line Oversight functions | Provides the risk management framework, tools and systems to  support effective risk management. | Management                              |\n| Third line Internal audit       | Provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk  management and internal controls.   | Board, Board Committees  and Management |\n\nOur risk framework supports the identification and management of emerging risks and escalating threats. During FY2022, the accelerating energy transition, continued COVID-19 challenges, as well as emerging geopolitical risks, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions were key threats to our operational and financial performance. These threats have required ongoing response and management across many of our existing material risks to minimise impacts. Our priorities remain focused on ensuring the continuity of our operations and supporting activities to provide essential services to our customers, and to maintain our financial resilience to respond to changes in global markets.\n\n## Material risks\n\nThe risks identified in this section have the potential to materially affect Origin's ability to meet our business objectives and impact its future financial prospects. These risks are not exhaustive and are not arranged in order of significance.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks arise from uncertainties that may emerge in the medium to longer term and, while they may not necessarily impact on shortterm profits, can have an immediate impact on the value of the Company. These strategic risks are managed through continuous monitoring and reviewing of emerging and escalating risks, ongoing planning and the allocation of resources, and evaluation from management and the Board.\n\n| Risk        | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Competition | Origin operates in a highly competitive retail environment which  can result in pressure on margins and customer losses.

If triggered, the reversionary rights require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45 per cent interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. The reversion trigger will occur when the revenue from the sale of petroleum from those CSG interests, plus any other revenue derived from or in connection with those CSG interests, exceeds the aggregate of all expenditure relating to those CSG interests plus interest on that expenditure, royalty payments and the original acquisition price.\n\nThe affected CSG interests represent approximately 20 per cent of APLNG's 3P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2022), and approximately 20 per cent of APLNG's 2P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2022).\n\nTri-Star served proceedings on APLNG in 2015 ('reversion proceeding') claiming that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008 following ConocoPhillips' investment in APLNG, on the assertion that the equity subscription monies paid by ConocoPhillips, or a portion of them, were revenue for purposes of the reversion trigger. Tri-Star has also claimed in the alternative that reversion occurred in 2011 or 2012 following Sinopec's investment in APLNG. These claims are referred to in this document as Tri-Star's \"past reversion\" claims.\n\nTri-Star has made other claims in the reversion proceeding against APLNG relating to other aspects of the reversion trigger (including as to the calculation of interest, calculation of revenue and the nature and quantum of APLNG's expenditures that can be included), the calculation of the royalty payable by APLNG to Tri-Star, rights in respect of infrastructure, and claims relating to gas sold by APLNG following the alleged reversion dates. APLNG denies these claims and is defending the proceedings.\n\nIf Tri-Star's past reversion claims are successful, then Tri-Star may be entitled to an order that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008. If the court determines that reversion has occurred, then APLNG may no longer have access to the reserves and resources that are subject to Tri-Star's reversionary interests and may need to source alternative supplies of gas (including from third parties) to meet its contracted commitments. There are also likely to be a number of further complex issues that would need to be resolved as a consequence of any such finding in favour of Tri-Star. These matters will need to be determined by the court (either in the current or in separate proceedings) or by agreement between the parties, and they include:\n\n- \u00b7 the terms under which some of the affected CSG interests will be operated where currently there are no joint operating agreements in place;\n- \u00b7 the amount of Tri-Star's contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment, which APLNG has stated in its defence and counter-claim are in the order of $4.56 billion (as at 31 December 2019) if reversion occurred on 1 November 2008; and\n- \u00b7 the consequences of APLNG having dealt with Tri-Star's reversionary interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment, including the gas produced from them. Tri-Star has:\n- - estimated the value of such gas which it has been unable to take since the alleged reversion, calculated by reference to the sale of gas as LNG and gas to domestic customers, to be approximately $3.37 billion (as at 31 March 2019) and approximately $1.3 billion per annum thereafter. In the alternative, Tri-Star claims that the value of such gas should be assessed by reference to the revenue derived by APLNG or its affiliates from LNG sales since the alleged reversion, being\n\napproximately $2.5 billion (as at March 2019), or $2.4 billion (as at March 2019) if the proceeds from the sale of LNG is determined to be calculated net of liquefaction costs; and\n\n- - alleged that it should be paid the value of such gas or is otherwise entitled to set-off the value of such gas from any amount owing to APLNG arising from APLNG's counter-claim for contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgement; and\n- \u00b7 if reversion occurred:\n- \u00b7 the extent of the reversionary interests principally with respect to Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 the repayment by Tri-Star of the ongoing royalty which has been paid by APLNG since reversion, resulting from its mistake as to the occurrence of the reversion trigger.\n\nIf APLNG is successful in defending Tri-Star's past reversion claims in the reversion proceeding, the potential for reversion to otherwise occur in the future in accordance with the reversion trigger will remain.\n\nIn 2017, Tri-Star commenced separate proceedings against APLNG ('markets proceeding') which allege that APLNG breached three CSG joint operating agreements by failing to offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those agreements) an opportunity to participate in the 'markets' alleged to be constituted by certain of its LNG and domestic gas sales agreements, including the Sinopec and Kansai LNG sale agreements entered into by APLNG in 2011 and 2012. Tri-Star has alleged that it should have been offered participation in those sales agreements for its share of production from those three CSG joint ventures referable to both its small participating interests and its reversionary interests in those joint ventures.\n\nIn September 2019, Tri-Star made further claims in the markets proceeding relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature and scope of the obligations of APLNG as operator pursuant to the CSG joint operating agreements;\n- \u00b7 Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 APLNG's entitlement as operator to charge (both historically and in the future) certain categories of costs under the relevant CSG joint operating agreements.\n\nTri-Star is seeking, amongst other things, damages and/or an order that APLNG offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those CSG joint operating agreements) the opportunity to participate in those sales agreements for their proportionate share of production from those three CSG joint ventures. APLNG denies these claims and is defending these proceedings.\n\nAPLNG filed defences and counterclaims in both proceedings in April and May 2020. In December 2020, Tri-Star filed replies and answers in both proceedings. APLNG filed its rejoinders in the reversion proceeding and the markets proceeding in February and April 2021 respectively. APLNG filed a further amended defence and counterclaim in the reversion proceeding in December 2021.\n\nIn September 2021, Tri-Star filed and served an application in both proceedings for questions to be determined separately (or further or alternatively referred to a referee to conduct an inquiry into and prepare a report to the court on those questions). The questions proposed for separate determination in those applications include the issue of whether the 2008 ConocoPhillips subscription monies are revenue for the purposes of the calculation of the reversion trigger. APLNG opposed those applications. The applications were heard in April 2022 and judgement has been reserved. Origin expects that the court will wait for the applications to be finally",

Origin's Statutory Profit contains a number of items that when excluded provide a different perspective on the financial and operational performance of the business.

A reconciliation and description of the items that contribute to the difference between Statutory Profit and Underlying Profit is provided in Section 5.1 of this OFR.\n\nCertain other non-IFRS financial measures are also included in this OFR. These non-IFRS financial measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin's business and make decisions on allocation of resources. Further information regarding the non-IFRS financial measures is included in the Glossary of this OFR. Non-IFRS financial measures have not been subject to audit or review.

Origin calculates Scope 3 emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard 21 and Scope 3 guidance documents 22 .\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring emissions under the calculation methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all emissions data or references to emissions volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this presentation are estimates. Where data is not available due to timing, Origin applies a reasonable estimation methodology. Where applicable, Origin revises prior year data to update prior estimates and align with external reporting requirements such as NGER.",

The ordinary dividends will be unfranked until APLNG starts paying income tax, which is expected to occur in the next few years. An income tax expense of $130 million was recognised during the year in respect of these unfranked dividends distributed out of APLNG's current year earnings.\n\nThere an unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of our investment in APLNG because the accounting cost base of the investment is higher than the tax cost base. The accounting carrying value has been augmented, primarily as a result of our equity accounted share of retained profits to date, while the tax cost base reflects only the cash outlaid.\n\nConsistent with accounting standards, the deferred tax liability has not been recognised historically because\n\n- 1. Origin is able to control the timing of distributions from APLNG which would reverse the temporary difference; and\n- 2. it has not been probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future via dividends paid from current retained earnings, capital returns or a disposal.\n\nAs it had become probable in FY2021 that APLNG would begin to distribute cash to shareholders via dividends in the coming years, Origin recognised a deferred tax liability of $669 million. During the period, the recognised deferred tax liability was reduced by $178 million, reflecting the deferred tax liability associated with the 10 per cent share of APLNG divested, and an additional amount of $217 million was recognised, reflecting improved outlook for distributable cash flows from APLNG. This has resulted in a net tax expense and a net increase in the recognised deferred tax liability of $39 million.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022 we have a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet of $708 million, representing 30 per cent of the dividends expected to be paid by APLNG in the foreseeable future from the carried forward equity accounted earnings based on current market assumptions, including future oil prices, at our residual interest of 27.5 per cent.\n\nRecognition of the deferred tax liability only impacts the timing of accounting for the tax expense and has no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows. There is a remaining unrecognised deferred tax liability at 30 June 2022 of $685 million which may be partly or fully recognised in the future.\n\nGoing forward, when Origin receives unfranked dividends from APLNG, the proportion paid from earnings in that year will give rise to a tax expense, and the balance attributable to carried forward equity accounted earnings will result in partial utilisation of the deferred tax liability.\n\n## 2 Accounting for large-scale generation certificate trading strategy\n\nSupply and demand for large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) is driven by the rate of new renewable projects coming online, voluntary demand for carbon offsets as well as the compliance obligations under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET). Renewable project delays and generation curtailments have led to a near-term tightening of the LGC market. However, it is expected that the 33 TWh legislated target will be exceeded and longer term the market will be oversupplied. The Clean Energy Regulator has acknowledged this and provides the option for parties to shift demand from periods of tight supply by deferring the surrender of certificates to later years. Under the scheme, parties can defer up to 10 per cent of their obligation at no additional cost and can defer more than 10 per cent by incurring a shortfall charge of $65 per certificate that is refundable provided the LGCs are surrendered within three years. Refunds are now non-assessable for tax following legislative change and aligns with the non-deductible treatment of the shortfall charge.\n\nThis presents an economic opportunity with the LGC forward curve in backwardation and Origin has elected to defer surrender of 2.5 million CY2020 certificates in February 2021 and 3.6 million CY2021 certificates in February 2022. Origin also expects to defer approximately 2.8 million CY2022 certificates due for surrender in February 2023.\n\n## FY2022 impact\n\nDuring FY2022, a shortfall charge of $236 million was paid in relation to CY2021 certificates of which $102 million was accrued in FY2021, and a further $92 million was accrued in relation to the first half of CY2022. Included in the FY2022 Underlying Profit is a cost of $74 million, reflecting the estimated future surrender cost, based on a weighted average of the current forward price and purchases to date, comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 1.6 million CY2021 certificates recorded in FY2021 repriced from $12 to $20;\n- \u00b7 2 million CY2021 certificates at $20/certificate; and\n- \u00b7 ~ 1.4 million CY2022 certificates at $14/certificate (estimate for the first half of CY2022).\n\nThe balance of $151 million is excluded from Underlying Profit.\n\n## FY2023 impact\n\nSubject to changes in volume and forward price estimates, we expect to incur a further $92 million for the shortfall charge for the second half of CY2021. A cost of $20 million will be recognised in FY2023 Underlying Profit and the balance of $72 million will be excluded from Underlying Profit.\n\nFuture surrender cost will continue to be reassessed each reporting period.",

Non-executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Non-executive Director Share Plan (NEDSP). During the year, one Non-executive Director elected to participate in the NEDSP, however the first allocation of Rights is not expected until FY23.\n\nThe following securities were granted to the five most highly remunerated officers (other than Directors) of the Company during the year ended 30 June 2022:\n\n|            | Restricted Shares   | Performance  Share Rights   | Restricted  Share Rights   | Matching Share  Plan Rights 1   |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| J Briskin  | 93,252              | 77,331                      | 77,331                     | 443                             |\n| G Jarvis   | 73,170              | 79,049                      | 79,050                     | 443                             |\n| A Lucas    | 46,858              | 63,067                      | 63,069                     | -                               |\n| A Thornton | 22,713              | 24,794                      | 24,792                     | 443                             |\n| L Tremaine | 104,872             | 87,385                      | 87,384                     | 443                             |\n\n- 1 Matching Share Plan Rights were granted in accordance with the Origin Employee Share Plan rules and disclosed to the ASX at the time of grant. The Employee Share Plan is available to all eligible Origin employees. Refer to Section 3.8 of the Remuneration Report for further details.\n\nThe awards of Restricted Shares, Performance Share Rights, and Restricted Share Rights were made in accordance with the Company's Equity Incentive Plan as part of the relevant Executive's remuneration. Further details on Rights granted during the financial year, and unissued shares under Options and Rights, are included in Section 7 of the Remuneration Report.\n\nNo Options or Rights were granted since the end of the financial year.\n\n## Origin shares issued on the exercise of Options and Rights\n\n## Options\n\nNo Options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan were exercised during or since the year ended 30 June 2022, so no ordinary shares in Origin were issued as a result.\n\n## Rights\n\n662,907 ordinary shares of Origin were allocated from the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust during the year ended 30 June 2022 on the vesting and exercise of RSRs and PSRs under the Equity Incentive Plan and Matching Share Plan Rights granted under the Employee Share Plan. No amounts were payable on the vesting of these RSRs, PSRs and Matching Share Plan Rights and, accordingly, no amounts remain unpaid in respect of any of those shares.\n\nSince 30 June 2022, 1,145 ordinary shares were allocated from the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust on the vesting of Matching Share Plan Rights granted under the Employee Share Plan.\n\nAll shares in the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust were purchased on market.\n\n## 7 Environmental regulation and performance\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental regulation under Commonwealth, State, and Territory legislation. For the year ended 30 June 2022, the Company notified 17 environmental reportable incidents to the relevant regulators (Integrated Gas: 10 and Energy Supply and Operations: 7). All of these incidents resulted in minor environmental consequences with the appropriate level of investigation undertaken. All incidents are investigated, and lessons learned captured and shared across the Company.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2022, Integrated Gas received one Environmental Protection Order, one penalty infringement notice, two breach notices, and nine formal warning letters from the Department of Environmental Science in Queensland.",

The Constitution also permits the Company to purchase and maintain a Directors' and Officers' insurance policy. No indemnity has been granted to an auditor of the Company in their capacity as auditor of the Company.\n\nThe Company has entered into agreements with current Directors and certain former Directors whereby it will indemnify those Directors from all losses or liabilities in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limits set by, the Constitution.\n\nThe agreements stipulate that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liability, including costs and expenses to the extent allowed under law. The Company is not aware of any liability having arisen, and no claim has been made against the Company during or since the year ended 30 June 2022 under these agreements.\n\nDuring the year, the Company has paid insurance premiums in respect of Directors' and Officers' liability, and legal expense insurance contracts for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\nThe insurance contracts insure against certain liability (subject to exclusions) of persons who are or have been Directors or Officers of the Company and its controlled entities. A condition of the contracts is that the nature of the liability indemnified and the premium payable not be disclosed.\n\n## 9 Auditor independence\n\nThere is no former partner or director of EY, the Company's auditors, who is or was at any time during the year ended 30 June 2022 an officer of the Origin Energy Group. The auditor's independence declaration for the financial year (made under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is attached to and forms part of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10 Non-audit services\n\nThe amounts paid or payable to EY for non-audit services provided during the year was $879,000 (shown to the nearest thousand dollars). Amounts paid to EY are included in note G7 to the full financial statements.\n\nBased on written advice received from the Audit Committee Chairman pursuant to a resolution passed by the Audit Committee, the Board has formed the view that the provision of those non-audit services by EY is compatible with, and did not compromise, the general standards of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The Board's reasons for concluding that the non-audit services provided by EY did not compromise its independence are:\n\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided were subjected to the Company's corporate governance procedures and were either below the pre- approved limits imposed by the Audit Committee or separately approved by the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided did not, and do not, undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards; and\n- \u00b7 there were no known conflict of interest situations nor any other circumstance arising out of a relationship between Origin (including its Directors and Officers) and EY which may impact on auditor independence.\n\n## 11 Proceedings on behalf of the Company\n\nThe Company is not aware of any proceedings being brought on behalf of the Company, nor any applications having been made in respect of the Company under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\n## 12 Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that class order, amounts in the financial report and Directors' Report have been rounded off to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 13 Remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Report forms part of this Directors' Report.",

It has been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and Accounting Standards, audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Act.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration, People and Culture Committee\n\nDear Shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration, People and Culture Committee (RPCC) and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for FY2022.\n\nThe Company has delivered solid results in another challenging year characterised by the extraordinary volatility of commodity prices and an uncertain regulatory environment. The higher earnings from Integrated Gas as Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) benefited from strong commodity prices were offset by a decline in Energy Market earnings. These were associated, in part, with a decline in retail prices (Default Market Offers) set when wholesale prices were low during COVID-19 and the recent rise in fuel prices.\n\nThe remuneration framework and governance processes have again shown that remuneration outcomes align with business outcomes and the shareholder experience. The remuneration framework has effectively dealt with the combination of market volatility, uncertainty and operational challenges during the period.\n\n## FY2022 remuneration outcomes\n\nAlthough the operating environment presented significant and varying challenges during the year, Origin's share price rose 27.1 per cent and recorded a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 32.4 per cent over the year, reflecting the resilience of our portfolio.\n\nKey factors driving remuneration outcomes for FY2022 included:\n\n- \u00b7 record-high revenue off the back of a strong rebound in commodity prices;\n- \u00b7 superior field performance and disciplined cost management that has enabled the Integrated Gas business to leverage the buoyant commodity market;\n- \u00b7 continuing progress on the transformation of the retail business, including the rollout of the Kraken technology platform and new operating model, to provide a superior customer experience at a lower cost (customer migration is on track for completion in mid FY2023);\n- \u00b7 strong market support following our announcement of the proposed closure of Eraring and the proposed installation of a large-scale battery, reflecting our commitment to playing a leading role in Australia's energy transition. Constructive response has also been received from our employees and the local community in relation to our comprehensive plans for a just and effective transition;\n- \u00b7 penalties of $17 million in relation to regulatory compliance failures with the implementation of certain customer payment plans. Significant action has been taken since to remedy the problem. Our Power On program currently supports and protects around 47,000 customer accounts in financial hardship, and we are focused on supporting them effectively through rising costs of living and the impact of recent price increases;\n- \u00b7 continuing strong performance of our strategic investment in Octopus Energy, now valued at more than \u00a33 billion (GBP), and disciplined capital management including crystallisation of some of the value in APLNG on the sale of 10 per cent of our interest; additionally our acquisition of WINconnect, which adds further scale to the Community Energy Services business.\n\nManagement's efforts in achieving these strong financial and operating outcomes, while managing a diverse and complex business, have resulted in the following incentive outcomes for FY2022:\n\n- \u00b7 the outcome for the CEO's Short Term Incentive (STI) scorecard was 74.6 per cent of maximum (124.6 per cent of target);\n- \u00b7 other Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) outcomes range between 69.3 and 80.4 per cent of maximum (115.8 to134.3 per cent of target); and\n- \u00b7 the aggregate outcome was 73.6 per cent of maximum (122.9 per cent of target).\n\nLong Term Incentive (LTI) awards tested during the year partially vested (25.0 per cent). One half of the August-October 2018 LTI grants was subject to a relative TSR hurdle and failed to vest. The other half was subject to two separate Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) hurdles for the Integrated Gas and Energy Markets businesses respectively, both of which partially vested at threshold levels. The overall vesting level was 25.0 per cent.\n\nLTI vesting outcomes for FY2023 will be determined at the end of August 2022. Indicatively the vesting outcome is expected to be around 16 per cent. Details of LTI outcomes are explained in more detail in Section 4.2.2.",

The architecture remains the same as that adopted in FY2020 and is fully described in Section 3.5.\n\n## FY2023 remuneration\n\nEach year the RPCC considers the remuneration framework's continuing appropriateness in terms of the organisation's strategies and priorities. It also considers the framework's effectiveness and capacity to provide realisable remuneration that attracts and keeps the right people, drives their focus and rewards execution.\n\nThe RPCC concluded that the current framework and policy settings remain balanced and appropriate, and accordingly, no changes are planned for FY2023.\n\nIn terms of changes to the level of FR for FY2023, adjustments across the wider organisation are expected to average in the 3.5-4.0 per cent, reflecting prevailing market conditions, and movements for Executive KMP will be consistent with this.\n\nFinally, there will be no changes to the structure or level of NED fees for FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steven Sargent\n\nChairman, Remuneration, People and Culture Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Origin believes that observance of our values and leadership behaviours and the quality of our relationships with our customers and the community are inextricably linked to the creation of shareholder value. Prior to making remuneration determinations, the full Board conducts formal reviews of management that incorporate individual performance, risk management and leadership behaviours. The Board may adjust variable outcomes up or down.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Equity is therefore a key element of remuneration, representing at least half of STI awards and the whole of LTI awards. This is supplemented by other share plan arrangements, including salary sacrifice, share purchase and matching plans (see Section 3.8).\n\nExecutive KMP are required to build and maintain a substantial shareholding in the Company (that is, the Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)). Executives are not expected to purchase shares to meet the requirement. The MSR operates as an additional trading restriction which prevents the disposal of shares (other than to cover arising tax liabilities) that have been generated from executive share plans until the MSR has been achieved and maintained. The requirement will normally be achieved within four years of the first equity grant following appointment.\n\nThe MSR is referenced to one of two nominal multiples of FR, one for the CEO and one applicable to all Other Executive KMP. Following changes to the LTIP in August 2020, the reference multiples are scheduled to increase from 200 per cent of the FR to 250 per cent of the FR for the CEO and from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the FR for Other Executive KMP, effective after August 2023, which is the earliest date from which the new plan can begin to impact vesting patterns.\n\nFor transparency, simplicity and practicability 1 , the MSR is expressed as a number of shares rather than a dollar value. From time to time, the Board changes this number, which is determined by taking into account changes in FR, changes to STI deferral or LTI opportunity levels, and the medium-term share price trend. The current determinations of 620,000 shares (CEO) and 130,000 shares (Other Executive KMP) are scheduled to increase to 720,000 and 160,000, respectively, in FY2024.\n\nShare rights awarded under incentive plans do not count towards the MSR obligation.\n\nTable 7.4 (a) shows that the CEO and Executive KMP exceed both the current and FY2024 MSR requirements, with the exception of new appointee Andrew Thornton, whose accumulation is on track to meeting his MSR.\n\n## 3 Remuneration framework details\n\n## 3.1 Fixed Remuneration\n\nFR comprises cash salary, employer contributions to superannuation and salary sacrifice benefits. It takes into account the size and complexity of the role, and the skills and experience required for success in the role.\n\nFR is reviewed annually, but increases are not guaranteed. Roles are benchmarked to the median of corresponding roles in organisations with comparable activity and scale and with which Origin competes for talent. 2 In the absence of special factors, new or newly promoted incumbents generally commence below this reference point and move to the median over time. FR may be positioned above this reference point where it is appropriate to reward sustained high performance, for key talent retention purposes or where it is necessary to attract and secure key skills to fill a business-critical role. Accordingly, the median positioning may vary between approximately the 40th and 60th percentile of the reference market.\n\n## 3.2 Variable Remuneration\n\nVariable Remuneration (VR) enables pay to be adjusted upwards or downwards, depending on whether performance outcomes exceed or fall short of expectations. Unlike bonus systems that pay for performance above expectations but do not reduce pay where performance falls short of them, VR does both. It is important to note that the total of FR plus VR is set and benchmarked such that the at target outcome represents the satisfaction of expected performance.\n\nVR comprises the total of STI and LTI:\n\n- \u00b7 The minimum VR is zero, where no STI or LTI is awarded, or where the STI scorecard outcome is zero and LTI is not awarded or all of it fails to vest, or where discretion is exercised to reduce such awards or vesting outcomes to zero.\n- \u00b7 The target VR represents the total of STI awarded at the target level, plus the target value of LTI (calculated as 50 per cent of the face value 3 of Performance Share Rights (PSRs) and 100 per cent of the face value of Restricted Share Rights (RSRs)). The LTI components are described in Section 3.5. The LTI target value represents a risked or expected (probabilistic) vesting outcome.\n- \u00b7 The maximum VR is the total of STI awarded at the maximum level, plus the full face value of all LTI assuming 100 per cent vesting.\n\nVR outcomes are subject to Board oversight and discretionary adjustment as summarised in Sections 4.2 and 5.3.",

For every two shares purchased under the salary sacrifice scheme within a 12-month cycle, participants are granted one Matching Right (MR) at no cost. The MRs vest two years after the cycle began, provided that the participant remains employed by the Company at this time. Each MR entitles the participant to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company, or in certain limited circumstances a cash equivalent payment. The MRs do not have any performance hurdles as they have been granted to encourage broad participation in the scheme across the Company, and to encourage employee share ownership. All shares are currently purchased on market.\n\nDirectors are not eligible to participate in the above schemes, but may participate in the NED Share Plan (NEDSP) by sacrificing Board fees. This plan is intended to facilitate share acquisition, enabling new Directors to meet their MSR obligations. All NEDs currently meet their MSR or are recently appointed. In FY2022, there was one participant sacrificing during the year. However no rights or shares have yet been allocated under the Plan. Rights and shares will be allocated in FY2023.\n\nDirectors regularly assess the risk of the Company losing high-performing key people who manage core activities or have skills that are being actively solicited in the market. Where appropriate, the Board may consider the selected use of deferred payment arrangements to reduce the risk of such critical loss. From time to time, it may be necessary to offer sign-on equity to offset or mirror unvested equity, which a prospective executive must forfeit to take up employment with Origin. No such arrangements were implemented for Executive KMP in FY2022.",

It has not been restated for the presentation of certain electricity hedge premiums, which are included in underlying from FY2019, or for the reclassification of futures collateral balances to operating cash flows (previously in financing cash flows in prior periods). A restatement for these factors for FY2018 only was provided in the FY2019 Consolidated Financial Statements at Note A1 Segments and in the Statement of cash flows, for indicative comparison purposes only.\n- 2 EPS is calculated on a continuing activities basis (excludes Lattice Energy for FY2018).\n- 3 Adjusted Net Debt for FY2020 includes first recognition of lease liability ($514 million) under AASB16.\n- 4 sNPS is an industry-recognised measure of customer advocacy. The measures were previously presented on a final-quarter average for each year and have been restated as the average over the whole of the relevant financial year.\n- 5 TRIFR is the total number of injuries resulting in lost time, restricted work duties or medical treatment per million hours worked.\n- 6 CEO-1 represents Executives reporting directly to the CEO. In line with market practice, it includes the CEO. CEO-2 includes roles directly reporting to CEO-1. Senior leadership roles captures the three reporting levels below CEO and includes roles with base salaries exceeding approximately $200,000 per annum.\n- 7 Employee engagement is measured as a score through an annual Company-wide survey conducted independently.\n- 8 This is the total dollar value of STI awarded for Executive KMP as a percentage of their total maximum STI. The percentage of STI forfeited is this amount subtracted from 100 per cent.\n- 9 The opening share price for FY2018 was $6.86.\n- 10 Dividends represent the interim plus final dividends determined for each financial year. For FY2022, this includes the final dividend determined on 18 August 2022 to be paid on 30 September 2022. The amounts paid within each financial year are 0c, 10c, 30c, 22.5c and 20.0c, respectively.\n- 11 TSR calculations use the three-month VWAP share price to 30 June, reflecting the testing methodology for relative TSR ranking.\n- 12 Following clarifying guidance from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, the Group has applied changes in accounting policies that require restatement of previously reported amounts. Refer to note G11 Prior year restatements, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 13 Underlying ROCE is defined in the Glossary and Interpretation.",

The starting points for setting STI scorecard targets are the relevant underlying measures from the financial accounts. Targets set at the beginning of the year may be subject to events materially outside the course of business and outside the control of the current management, in which case discretion may be required to vary targets or outcomes to reflect the intended purpose and/or actual results and achievements. The principles provide a structured process for the consideration of adjustments and the exercise of discretion, and a decision framework that seeks fairness (to both Executives and shareholders) and balance between favourable and unfavourable events.\n\n## 4.2.2 Short-term performance and STI outcomes\n\nSTI awards are calculated on the basis of a balanced scorecard, with requirements set at threshold, target and stretch achievement levels. The CEO's FY2022 scorecard showing measures, outcomes and results is summarised below. 4\n\n| Measure, rationale and performance                                                                                                                                                                                          |        | Targets and outcomes Target Stretch   | Targets and outcomes Target Stretch   | Targets and outcomes Target Stretch   | Result   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Weight | Threshold                             |                                       |                                       | (% max)  |\n| Underlying EPS (cents)                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        | 4.4                                   | 10.4                                  | 18.3                                  |          |\n| Measure of earnings and profitability.

In addition, it reflects very strong performance against the three non-financial strategic priorities defined for the year (78.9 per cent of maximum) accounting for the remaining 40 per cent of the STI award. The overall scorecard outcome was 74.6 per cent of maximum (124.6 per cent of target).\n\nApplication of the principles described in Section 4.2.1 included the following adjustments:\n\n- \u00b7 The significant impact of the sale of our 10 per cent interest in APLNG was excluded from the NCOIA result and Integrated Gas Capital Employed.\n- \u00b7 The impact of the WINconnect acquisition was removed from the NCOIA result and from the Energy Markets ROCE EBIT.\n- \u00b7 The NCOIA result was adjusted for the cost of the additional investment in Octopus Energy.\n- \u00b7 Penalties and legal costs associated with Australian Energy Regulator action, excluded from underlying financial measures, were included for the purposes of the relevant metrics in STI awards.\n\n## 4.2.3 Executive KMP STI outcomes\n\nOrigin's EPS and NCOIA targets, and therefore results, represent half of the financial metrics for all Executive KMP. The remaining financial metrics for divisional Executive General Managers are based on divisional targets. While Energy Markets EBITDA and Retail EBITDA contributed zero and small contributions, respectively, there has been a relative outperformance in Integrated Gas. Accordingly, scorecard outcomes ranged between 69.3 to 80.4 per cent of maximum.\n\n|               | STI award   | STI award    | STI award   | STI award   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Executive KMP | % of target | % of maximum | % forfeited | $'000       |\n| F Calabria    | 124.6       | 74.6         | 25.4        | 2,343       |\n| L Tremaine    | 124.6       | 74.6         | 25.5        | 1,299       |\n| J Briskin     | 115.8       | 69.3         | 30.7        | 1,071       |\n| G Jarvis      | 117.6       | 70.4         | 29.6        | 1,100       |\n| A Thornton 1  | 134.3       | 80.4         | 19.6        | 793         |\n\n- 1 The STI award for A Thornton relates to the period as KMP.\n\n## 4.2.4 Long-term performance and LTI outcomes\n\nIn FY2022, the Company's share price increased 27.1 per cent, TSR by 32.4 per cent and underlying ROCE by 71.1 per cent. Longer term measures in the performance summary in Section 4.1 over the last five years show that dividends have been restored and stabilised; female representation has significantly increased across all levels of leadership; and engagement, though dipping in the challenging FY2022 year, is above the average and close to the top quartile of organisations in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nImproving performance has been reflected in partial vesting of LTIP awards in the last two years, following eight years of zero vesting outcomes.\n\nA partial vesting (25.0 per cent) of LTI awards granted in FY2019 occurred on 23 August 2021. One half of that grant was subject to relative TSR conditions and failed to vest. The other half was subject to ROCE hurdles in two equal tranches, one determined by results in the Integrated Gas business and the other by results across Energy Markets, over three years. Each of these two latter elements met its threshold vesting requirement (9.0 per cent for Energy Markets and 6.1 per cent for Integrated Gas, measured on an LTI basis), delivering 50 per cent in each case, a total of 25 per cent of all rights tested.\n\nVesting outcomes for FY2023 will be determined at the end of August 2022. Testing will include the last tranche of Options that the Company has granted (in August to October 2017). These Options were subject to a five-year TSR hurdle relative to a ten-up/ten-down market capitalisation peer group. Origin's performance will not meet the median peer TSR performance and all of the Options will lapse. Testing will also include PSRs granted in August and October 2019, half of which were subject to a three-year TSR hurdle (relative to ASX 50) and the balance to three-year ROCE hurdles. Origin's performance will not meet the median peer TSR performance and all of these PSRs will lapse. The ROCE tranche is divided equally into Energy Markets and Integrated Gas hurdles. The Energy Markets tranche will not meet threshold vesting requirements, while the Integrated Gas tranche is likely to approach its full vesting level (9.1 per cent). The overall vesting outcome for FY2023 is expected to be around 16 per cent.",

It operates under a Charter (published on the Company's website at originenergy.com.au). The RPCC met formally five times during the reporting period.\n\nIncluding its Chairman, the RPCC has four members, all of whom are independent NEDs (see Section 1 for details). The RPCC's Charter requires a minimum of three NEDs. In addition, there is a standing invitation to all Board members to attend the RPCC's meetings. Management may attend RPCC meetings by invitation but a member of management will not be present when their own remuneration is under discussion.\n\nThe following diagram sets out the role of the RPCC and its operational relationships with the Board, management, stakeholders and external advisors.\n\n## 5.2 Remuneration advisors\n\nThe RPCC engages external advisors from time to time to conduct benchmarking, advise on regulatory and market developments, and review proposals and reports. Protocols have been established for engaging and dealing with external advisors, including those defined as remuneration consultants for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 . These protocols are to ensure independence and avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nThe protocols require that remuneration advisors are directly engaged by the RPCC and act on instruction from its Chairman. Reports must be delivered directly to the RPCC Chairman. The advisor is prohibited from communicating with Company management except as authorised by the Chairman, and even then, this is limited to the provision or validation of factual and policy data. The advisor must furnish a statement confirming the absence of any undue influence from management.\n\nThe RPCC generally seeks information rather than specific remuneration recommendations within the definition of the Act, and this was the case during FY2022. Guerdon Associates was appointed for this period; no remuneration recommendations as defined under the Act were provided.\n\nIn addition, the RPCC makes use of general market trend information from a variety of commercial and industry sources and has access to in-house remuneration professionals who provide it with guidance and analysis on request.\n\nThe recommendations that the RPCC makes to the Board are based on its own independent assessment of the advice and information received from these multiple sources, using its experience and having careful regard to the principles and objectives of the remuneration framework, Company performance, shareholder and community expectations, and good governance.",

The oversight can be divided into the stages set out below, and it is designed to ensure that outcomes are fair to executives and to stakeholders, consistent in approach, and governed by documented principles.\n\n## 5.3.1 Through the performance period\n\nThroughout the STI performance year and LTI vesting periods, the Board monitors and reviews management performance against financial and non-financial targets, including factors affecting the original assumptions underlying the setting of targets at the beginning of the relevant performance periods.\n\nPotential adjustments that may be required are considered under a set of protocols that cover materiality, symmetry of treatment for favourable and unfavourable events, the degree to which events are foreseeable and controllable by management, and the impact of Board decisions (for example, mergers and acquisitions). Any adjustments are subject to Board approval at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe outcome from this stage comprises preliminary STI outcomes and preliminary LTI vesting outcomes.\n\n## 5.3.2 At the end of the financial year\n\nAt the end of each financial year the full Board conducts a formal Executive Performance Review of the CEO and each member of the ELT, including the preliminary remuneration outcomes. The review is a formal and holistic process which considers:\n\n- \u00b7 risk, audit, compliance and reputation matters (including whistle-blowing, discrimination, bullying or harassment complaints; and safety and employee relations matters);\n- \u00b7 enterprise and business strategy contribution; and\n- \u00b7 leadership habits and behaviours. 5\n\nThe process includes taking feedback from:\n\n- \u00b7 Chair of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee;\n- \u00b7 Chair of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Internal Auditor;\n- \u00b7 General Counsel and EGM Company Secretariat, Risk and Governance; and\n- \u00b7 Executive General Manager, People & Culture. 6\n\nAs a performance review process, the output includes performance feedback and identifies specifically whether there are any matters that warrant the exercise of downward discretion to modify individual executives' preliminary remuneration outcomes. In exceptional circumstances the Board may exercise upward discretion, within the capped opportunity level.\n\nDuring this stage, the Board will also consider whether any exercises of discretion are appropriate on a collective basis, and in the overall context of ensuring that the outcomes represent a reasonable and fair reflection of the company's performance from the perspective of all stakeholders.\n\nThe output from this stage comprises final STI outcomes and final LTI vesting decisions.\n\n## 5.3.3 Beyond the performance period\n\nIssues may emerge after final results have been notified where the Board deems that those results are no longer appropriate, or that the results would give rise to the receipt of an inappropriate benefit. Where such issues emerge before payment has been made or before rights have vested or shares have been released from trading locks, the Board may reduce or cancel the award or the vesting level, and/or extend the period of a trading lock under the Company's malus provisions. The deferral period for equity (two years for STI and five years for all tranches of LTI) means that the exercise of malus is available for significant periods of time.\n\nWhere benefits have been paid, vested or released, the Company's clawback provisions give the Board further powers to recover cash proceeds from the sale of shares and to recover cash awards. These powers may be limited by statute or regulation.\n\nOf course, fraud, dishonesty, gross misconduct, negligence, breach of duties and other serious matters would have consequences additional to the remuneration impacts described above.\n\nDownward discretions have been exercised by the Board from time to time, both to STI outcomes and to LTI allocations or vesting outcomes, to provide better alignment of variable pay outcomes with the broader context and overall circumstances of the Company. There have been no circumstances to date in which the Board has sought to apply the clawback provisions.\n\n## 5.4 Change of control and capital reorganisation\n\nOn a change of control event the Board may determine that all or a specified number of unvested securities will vest or cease to be subject to restrictions.\n\nOn a capital reorganisation, the Board may determine the manner of adjustment of the number of unvested share rights and Options held by participants to minimise or eliminate any material advantage or disadvantage to the participant. If new awards are granted, they will, unless the Board determines otherwise, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original awards.",

This ensures that NEDs can independently and objectively assess both Executive and Company performance.\n\nBoard and committee fees take into account market rates for similar positions at relevant Australian organisations (those of comparable size and complexity) and fairly reflect the time commitments and responsibilities involved. The aggregate cap for overall NED remuneration remains at $3.2 million p.a., as approved by shareholders in 2017.\n\nThe Origin Chairman receives a single fee that includes committee activities, while other NEDs receive a NED Base Fee and separate fees for their role on specific committees (other than the Nomination Committee, which is considered within the NED Base Fee). All fees include superannuation contributions.\n\nThe table below summarises the structure and level of NED fees. No change to the fee structure or quantum is proposed for FY2023.\n\nTable 7-4 (b) shows that all NEDs meet the current MSR obligation apart from recent appointee Joan Withers, who is on track to meeting her MSR.\n\n| Office                                                        | FY2022 and FY2023 ($'000)   | FY2022 and FY2023 ($'000)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                               | Chairman                    | Member                      |\n| Board                                                         | 677 1                       | 196                         |\n| Audit Committee                                               | 57                          | 29                          |\n| RPCC, Safety and Sustainability Committee, and Risk Committee | 47                          | 23.5                        |\n| Nomination Committee                                          | nil                         | nil                         |\n\n## 6.2 Minimum Shareholding Requirement for Non-executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with those of shareholders, NEDs are required to build and maintain a substantive shareholding in the Company (the MSR). NEDs may purchase shares directly or through the NEDSP that was approved by shareholders in 2018. The NEDSP is a fee sacrifice plan that allows NEDs to acquire share rights (rights to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in the Company) subject to the terms of the grant. The NEDSP is intended to facilitate the acquisition of shares for new Directors to meet their MSR obligation while recognising that opportunities for direct purchases by Directors may be limited. NEDs are expected to reach their MSR within three years of their appointment. During FY2022, one NED commenced salary sacrificing fees under the NEDSP. However, no rights or shares are scheduled to be allocated until FY2023. There were no rights or shares allocated during the reporting period under the NEDSP, as there had been no prior participants under the NEDSP.\n\nThe NED MSR is determined from time to time as a number of shares referenced to a nominal multiple of fees. The determination takes into account changes in fees and share prices over time. The nominal reference multiple is 100 per cent of the annual base NED fee for all NEDs except for the Chairman of the Board, where it is 200 per cent of the annual base NED fee. The current share determinations of 28,000 shares for NEDs and 56,000 shares for the Chairman are to be increased to 36,000 and 72,000, respectively, from August 2023.\n\nShare rights held by NEDs under the NEDSP (FY2022: nil) will count towards the satisfaction of NED MSR obligations because they are funded through sacrifice of fees by the participating Director. The shares allocated on vesting of the share rights are bought on market on behalf of the Director and are not subject to forfeiture.",

benefits including insurance premiums and fringe benefits (such as car parking and expenses associated with travel).\n- 2 STI cash represents one half of the STI award. STI cash is paid after the end of the financial year to which it relates but is allocated to the earning year. The balance of the STI award is Deferred STI.\n- 3 Movement in leave provision over the reporting period. Negative movement indicates that leave taken during the year exceeded leave accrued during the current year.\n- 4 Share based remuneration is that portion of the accounting value of equity granted or to be granted for the current and prior periods attributable to the reporting period. Where vesting of the equity is conditional on a non-market hurdle (for example ROCE, or the underpinning metrics in the LTI RSR tranche) in following reporting periods the accumulated expense is adjusted for the number of instruments then expected to be released or vested. In good leaver circumstances, a bring-forward of future-period accounting expense may occur where a cessation of employment occurs before the normal vesting date. See Note G3 for details on share-based remuneration accounting.\n- 5 For FY2022, pro-rata period for KMP office is from 1 November 2021 to 30 June 2022.\n- 6 For FY2021, 'Other' includes accommodation benefits associated with travel from home base to the Brisbane office.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details of awards granted in prior years, including applicable service and performance conditions, are summarised in prior Remuneration Reports corresponding to the reporting period in which the awards were granted.\n\nTable 7-5 Summary of share rights outstanding\n\n| Granted                  | Number  outstanding 1   | Number held by KMP   | Exercise price ($)   | Earliest vest date 2   | Last possible expiry date   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Legacy Options           |                         |                      |                      |                        |                             |\n| 30-Aug-17                | 821,594                 | 215,054              | 7.37                 | 22-Aug-22              | 22-Aug-22                   |\n| 18-Oct-17                | 401,288                 | 401,288              | 7.37                 | 22-Aug-22              | 22-Aug-22                   |\n| Performance Share Rights |                         |                      |                      |                        |                             |\n| 30-Aug-19                | 1,648,867               | 471,188              | -                    | 22-Aug-22              |                             |\n| 16-Oct-19                | 452,742                 | 452,742              | -                    | 22-Aug-22              |                             |\n| 3-Nov-20                 | 955,692                 | 391,573              | -                    | 21-Aug-23              |                             |\n| 6-Sep-21                 | 1,039,173               | 268,559              | -                    | 26-Aug-24              |                             |\n| 20-Oct-21                | 235,989                 | 235,989              | -                    | 26-Aug-24              |                             |\n| Restricted Share Rights  |                         |                      |                      |                        |                             |\n| 3-Nov-20                 | 322,570                 | 130,524              | -                    | 21-Aug-23              |                             |\n| 3-Nov-20                 | 322,570                 | 130,524              | -                    | 26-Aug-24              |                             |\n| 3-Nov-20                 | 322,570                 | 130,524              | -                    | 25-Aug-25              |                             |\n| 6-Sep-21                 | 351,533                 | 89,519               | -                    | 26-Aug-24              |                             |\n| 6-Sep-21                 | 351,533                 | 89,519               | -                    | 25-Aug-25              |                             |\n| 6-Sep-21                 | 351,533                 | 89,519               | -                    | 24-Aug-26              |                             |\n| 20-Oct-21                | 78,663                  | 78,663               | -                    | 26-Aug-24              |                             |\n| 20-Oct-21                | 78,663                  | 78,663               | -                    | 25-Aug-25              |                             |\n| 20-Oct-21                | 78,663                  | 78,663               | -                    | 24-Aug-26              |                             |\n| Matching Rights          |                         |                      |                      |                        |                             |\n| 25-Sep-20                | 285,053                 | 2,112                | -                    | 21-Oct-22              |                             |\n| 24-Sep-21                | 113,847                 | 768                  | -                    | 20-Oct-23              |                             |\n\n- 1 Options and PSRs with the earliest vest date of 22 August 2022 were tested on 30 June 2022. These Options and PSRs (TSR hurdle only) did not satisfy the vesting conditions and will lapse on 22 August 2022, in accordance with the Plan Rules. This applies to Options granted in 2017 and PSRs granted in 2019 (TSR hurdle only, the remaining total balance of 2019 PSRs: 1,050,807; held by KMP: 461,965).\n- 2 The vest date for PSRs and RSRs granted since 2018 does not include the trading restriction of approximately one to two years that applies to the shares allocated on vesting.\n- 3 Where no expiry is given, automatic exercise applies at vesting. To the extent that rights fail to meet the relevant performance conditions, they will lapse effective on the test date, which may be on or before the vest date.\n- 4 Options with the expiry date of 22 August 2022 failed their test on 30 June 2022 and as such will lapse on 22 August 2022, in accordance with the Plan Rules.\n\n## Loans to KMP\n\nNo loans have been made, guaranteed or secured, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, at any time throughout the year, in relation to any KMP including to a KMP-related party.\n\nSigned in accordance with a resolution of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott Perkins\n\nChairman",

The address of the Company's registered office is Level 32, Tower 1, 100 Barangaroo Avenue, Barangaroo NSW 2000. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its controlled entities (the Group or Origin) are described in the segment information in note A1.\n\nOn 18 August 2022, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these consolidated general purpose financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared:\n\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board;\n- \u00b7 on a historical cost basis, except for derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value; and\n- \u00b7 on a going concern basis.\n\nThe financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 are presented in Australian dollars;\n- \u00b7 are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191; and\n- \u00b7 do not early adopt any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nFollowing clarifying guidance from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), the Group has applied changes in accounting policies that require restatement of previously reported amounts. The nature and effect of each new amendment on the Group's consolidated financial report are described below.\n\nIFRIC agenda decision - Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement -SaaS restatement\n\nIn April 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) published an\n\nagenda decision for configuration and customisation costs incurred related to a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement. Consequently, the Group has changed its accounting policy in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of changing this policy is described below.\n\nSaaS arrangements are arrangements in which the Group does not currently control the underlying software used in the arrangement.\n\nWhere costs incurred to configure or customise SaaS arrangements result in the creation of a resource which is identifiable, and where the company has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits, such costs are recognised as a separate intangible software asset and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis. The amortisation is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and any changes are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\n\nWhere costs incurred to configure or customise do not result in the recognition of an intangible software asset, then those costs that provide the Group with a distinct service (in addition to the SaaS access) are now recognised as expenses when the supplier provides the services. When such costs incurred do not provide a distinct service, the costs are now recognised as expenses over the duration of the SaaS contract. Previously, some costs had been capitalised and amortised over its useful life.\n\n## IFRIC agenda decision - Economic Benefits from Use of a Windfarm (IFRS 16 Leases) -PPAs restatement\n\nIn December 2021, IFRIC published a final agenda decision addressing whether an agreement for the use of a windfarm provides the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits to qualify as a lease. It was determined that such an agreement conveyed neither the right nor the obligation for the retailer to obtain any of the electricity produced by the windfarm, and as such does not contain a lease. Following the IFRIC clarification, the Group has changed its accounting policy in relation to the treatment of some renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) previously recognised as leases. As a result of applying the above guidance to the Group's renewable PPAs, certain agreements have been retrospectively recognised as electricity derivatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact on financial statements\n\nIn accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the changes in accounting policies have been adopted retrospectively and prior periods comparatives have been restated. Restated amounts are detailed in note G11.\n\n## Use of judgements and estimates\n\nPreparing the financial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires management to make judgements and apply estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions, which are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Throughout the notes to the financial statements, further information is provided about key management judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements.\n\n## The Group's operating environment and COVID-19\n\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic; the Group's operating environment has experienced very challenging energy market conditions, with high prices and periods of supply constraints. This is most evident with the Ukraine war and the move by many countries away from importing energy from Russia. This is driving higher global energy prices and causing countries to place greater national importance on energy security.\n\nThese factors have had wider impacts on consumers, businesses and the overall economy. The Group entered the 2022 financial year in a financially resilient position with significantly reduced upstream costs at APLNG, and materially reduced debt. This has enabled the Group to respond to the above factors with a focus on safely maintaining energy supply and supporting customers who have been financially affected.\n\n## AEMO market suspension\n\nDuring the year, Origin has experienced unprecedented energy market conditions with extremely high and volatile electricity prices, driven by generation supply constraints in the National Electricity Market (NEM), high coal and gas fuel costs and wet weather impacted renewable energy generation. These conditions culminated with periods of administered wholesale electricity pricing",

With an aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the Group is committed to helping lead the transition to a low-carbon future by progressively decarbonising its business.\n\nThe Group has identified certain key physical and transition risks relating to climate change. These include changes in market supply and demand for energy and fossil fuels, government policy and regulation in relation to climate change and other technological advancements that might occur as the decarbonisation transition unfolds.\n\nThe Group continues to monitor climaterelated legislation and policies that impact the financial report and will incorporate any required changes as they arise. We recognise that there is significant uncertainty around the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy and future changes to the Group's climate change strategy or realisation of global decarbonisation ambitions quicker or more slowly than currently anticipated may impact some of the Group's significant judgements and key estimates.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the key judgements and estimates consider the range of economic conditions that are forecast to exist over the remaining useful lives of assets, including expectations about future operations, the current outlook for commodity prices, discount rates, capital expenditure requirements and market supply and demand profiles. Climate change will impact those areas of the financial statements that are subject to estimation uncertainties in the medium to long term and can also introduce more volatility in assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nThe Group's current strategy to manage the risks associated with climate change is contemplated in the significant judgements and estimates in the following notes to the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 B2 - Investment in APLNG\n- \u00b7 C2 - Exploration assets\n- \u00b7 C3 - Property, plant and equipment\n- \u00b7 C4 - Intangible assets\n- \u00b7 C6 - Provisions - restoration\n- \u00b7 C8 - Impairment of non-current assets\n\nIn February 2022, the Group announced plans to accelerate the exit from coal-fired power generation, bringing forward the closure of the Eraring Power Station by up to seven years to as early as 2025, with timing to be determined closer to 2025. This announcement will reduce the exposure of the financial statements to climate change risks in future years.\n\nThe recoverable amount estimates used in the impairment assessment for the Energy Markets Generation CGU considers climate change risk through the adjustment of cashflows associated with the early closure of Eraring in 2025. In line with this, the useful life of the Eraring Power Station has been adjusted to accelerate the depreciation expense in future years reflecting the earlier closure date. Refer to note C3.\n\nSimilarly, the timing of restoration activities and associated cashflows for the Eraring site remediation work have been brought forward and are reflected in the provision balance at 30 June 2022. Refer to note C6.\n\n## Paris Agreement and net zero emissions by 2050\n\nThe Group acknowledges that there are a range of possible energy transition scenarios that are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. One such scenario is the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario which reflects a world where there is significantly strengthened government and climate policy in order to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAt a domestic level, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) produces various climate scenarios for the gas and electricity sector such as the 'strong electrification' scenario which is derived from the IEA NZE scenario and has also been designed to reflect a world where warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe Group considers these scenarios when testing the resilience of the portfolio for the impact of climate change. At this time, the Group does not utilise the key assumptions in these scenarios to derive the critical accounting estimates in the financial statements, as these are not viewed as the most likely outcome given the uncertainty around the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy. The key estimates in the financial statements are determined using the Group's base case assumptions which are informed by an assessment of the current market outlook.\n\nAlthough all potential financial reporting consequences under the scenarios above are impracticable to fully assess, the long-term commodity price outlook under the above 1.5\u00b0C scenarios would result in the following impact to the financial statements:\n\n## Energy Markets\n\nFor Energy Markets, commodity prices under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario are net favourable compared to the price outlook in the current base case assumptions, benefiting existing assets such as the peaking generation fleet and PPAs. Increased electrification of the NEM and other growth areas such as electric vehicle penetration and an increase in connected services as customers decarbonise their homes will provide further opportunities for the retail business. The recent announcement of the early closure of Eraring and the impairments recognised in FY2022 limit the exposure of the carrying value of the assets in the Energy Markets segment to long-term commodity price movements. There is no expected impact to the useful lives of the remaining assets or restoration and rehabilitation provisions under this 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Investment in APLNG\n\nFor the Group's investment in APLNG, the commodity price outlook and carbon price assumptions under this 1.5\u00b0C scenario are unfavourable compared to the price outlooks in the current base case. A key input into the recoverable amount assessment is the long-term oil price assumption, with the Group's base case assumption of US$60/bbl (real, 2022) favourable compared to the IEA NZE oil price assumptions of US$36 by 2030 (real, 2022), US$30 by 2040 (real, 2022) and US$24 by 2050 (real, 2022).\n\nThe Group's preliminary assessment of the recoverable amount using the IEA NZE commodity and carbon price assumptions indicates that there is still significant value in the investment in APLNG despite the sharp price reductions. It is noted that the impact of applying these prices alone would result in an impairment of the investment at 30 June 2022, however it is currently impracticable to fully assess the potential impact under such a pricing environment as the Group would take steps to mitigate any adverse cashflow impact by adjusting its future operational and investment decisions.\n\nThere are inherent limitations with scenario analysis, and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes or probabilities, and scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate. Scenarios may also be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed.",

This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nThe reporting segments are organised according to the nature of the activities undertaken and are detailed below.\n\n- \u00b7 Energy Markets : Energy retailing and wholesaling, power generation and LPG operations predominantly in Australia. Also includes Origin's investment in Octopus Energy Holdings Limited (Octopus Energy).\n- \u00b7 Integrated Gas : Origin's investment in APLNG, exploration interests in the Beetaloo, Cooper-Eromanga and Canning basins and costs associated with growth initiatives such as hydrogen. It also includes overhead costs (net of recoveries from APLNG) and costs incurred in managing Origin's exposure to LNG pricing risk and impacts of its LNG trading positions. For greater transparency, the investment in APLNG is presented separately from the residual component of the segment.\n- \u00b7 Corporate : Various business development and support activities that are not allocated to operating segments, including corporate treasury and tax items.\n\nUnderlying profit and underlying EBITDA are non-statutory (non-IFRS) measures. The objective of measuring and reporting underlying profit and underlying EBITDA is to provide a more meaningful and consistent representation of financial performance by removing items that distort performance or are non-recurring in nature.\n\nItems excluded from the calculation of underlying profit are reported to the Managing Director as not representing the underlying performance of the business and thus are excluded from underlying profit or underlying EBITDA. These items are determined after consideration of the nature of the item, the significance of the amount and the consistency in treatment from period to period.\n\nThe nature of items excluded from underlying profit and underlying EBITDA are:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in the fair value of financial instruments not in accounting hedge relationships, to remove the significant volatility caused by timing mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the related underlying transactions. The valuation changes are subsequently recognised in underlying earnings when the underlying transactions are settled;\n- \u00b7 Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses on debt held to hedge USD-denominated investment in APLNG;\n- \u00b7 Significant redundancies and other costs in relation to business restructuring, transformation or integration activities;\n- \u00b7 Gains/losses on the sale or acquisition of an asset/entity;\n- \u00b7 Transaction costs incurred in relation to the sale or acquisition of an entity;\n- \u00b7 Impairments of assets;\n- \u00b7 Significant onerous contracts;\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax liability recognition relating to the APLNG investment;\n- \u00b7 Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) net shortfall charge; and\n- \u00b7 Other significant non-recurring items.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When determining revenue for the financial period, management estimates the volume of energy supplied since a customer's last bill. The estimation of unbilled consumption requires judgement and is based on various assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 volume and timing of energy consumed by customers;\n- \u00b7 allocation of estimated electricity and gas volumes to various pricing plans;\n- \u00b7 discounts linked to customer payment patterns; and\n- \u00b7 loss factors.\n\nManagement also uses unbilled consumption volumes to accrue network expenses incurred by the Group for unread customer electricity and gas meters.\n\nThe calculation of unbilled revenue requires significant judgement in estimating the level of energy consumption by customers during the unbilled period to 30 June 2022. The Group uses a backcasting model and volume-matching process to provide a reliable estimate of unbilled revenue as at 30 June 2022. Refer to note C1 for the Group's consideration of the COVID-19 impact on its cash collection of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## Retail contracts\n\nRetail electricity service is generally marketed through standard service offers that provide customers with discounts on published tariff rates. Contracts have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption, and can be terminated by the customer at any time without significant penalty. The supply of energy is considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised upon delivery to customers at the offered rate. Where customers are eligible to receive additional behavioural discounts, Origin considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process.\n\n## Business and wholesale contracts\n\nContracts with business and wholesale customers are generally medium to long-term, higher-volume arrangements with fixed or index-linked energy rates that have been commercially negotiated. The nature and accounting treatment of this revenue stream is largely consistent with retail sales. Some business and wholesale sales arrangements also include the transfer of renewable energy certificates (RECs), which represent an additional performance obligation. Revenue is recognised for these contracts when Origin has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that corresponds directly with the value of units of energy delivered to the customer.\n\nPool revenue relates to sales by Origin generation assets into the NEM, as well as revenue associated with gross settled PPAs. Origin has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to transactions with the NEM and therefore recognises pool sales on a gross basis. Revenue from these sales is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the electricity passes to the grid.",

Revenue is recognised at the point in time that the system is installed, or the service provided is complete. Community Energy Services supplies electricity and gas within embedded network sites. Similar to Retail contracts, the supply of energy is considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised upon delivery to the customers at the offered rate.\n\n## LPG and Integrated Gas\n\nRevenue from the sale of LPG (from Origin's Energy Markets segment) and LNG (from Origin's Integrated Gas segment) is recognised at the point in time that the customer takes physical possession of the commodity. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received.\n\n## A3 Other income\n\n|                                                        |   2022 $m | 2021 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net gain on dilution of investments (refer to note B4) |        44 | -         |\n| Fees and services, and other income                    |       106 | 43        |\n| Other income                                           |       150 | 43        |\n| Interest earned from other parties 1                   |        13 | 3         |\n| Interest earned on APLNG MRCPS (refer to note B4)      |        48 | 106       |\n| Interest income                                        |        61 | 109       |\n\n- 1 Interest income is measured using an effective interest rate method and recognised as it accrues.\n\n## A4 Expenses\n\n|                                                                   | 2022 $m   | 2021 1 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Cost of sales 2                                                   | 13,388    | 10,261      |\n| Employee expenses 3                                               | 690       | 643         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                     | 449       | 541         |\n| Impairment of non-current assets 4                                | 2,196     | 1,504       |\n| Net loss on divestment 5                                          | 113       | -           |\n| Impairment of trade receivables (net of bad debts recovered)      | 65        | 88          |\n| (Increase)/decrease in fair value of derivatives                  | (1,155)   | 809         |\n| Net (gain)/loss from financial instruments measured at fair value | (85)      | 163         |\n| Net loss on sale of assets                                        | 2         | 11          |\n| Net foreign exchange loss/(gain)                                  | 128       | (163)       |\n| Onerous contracts provision 6                                     | (51)      | (176)       |\n| Other 7                                                           | 575       | 477         |\n| Expenses                                                          | 16,315    | 14,158      |\n| Interest on borrowings                                            | 169       | 218         |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                     | 17        | 17          |\n| Unwind of discounting on long-term provisions                     | 4         | 7           |\n| Interest expense                                                  | 190       | 242         |\n\n- 1 Certain amounts have been restated to reflect adjustments disclosed in note G11.\n- 2 Includes variable lease payments of $24 million (2021: $21 million).\n- 3 Includes contributions to defined contribution superannuation funds of $60 million (2021: $62 million).\n- 4 Refer to note C8.\n- 5 Relates to the divestment of 10 per cent of Origin's investment in APLNG.

Operating, management and funding decisions require the unanimous support of the Foundation Shareholders, which includes the Group and ConocoPhillips. Accordingly, joint control exists and the Group has classified the investment in APLNG as a joint venture.\n- 2 Octopus Energy is a separate legal entity. The Group's investment is equity accounted as a result of the Group's active participation on the Board and the Group's ability to impact decision making, leading to the assessment that significant influence exists.\n- 3 Refer to note B4 for details of additional equity transactions after 30 June 2022.\n\nOf all the above joint ventures and associates, only the interests in APLNG and Octopus Energy have a material impact on the Group at 30 June 2022.\n\n## B2 Investment in APLNG\n\nThis section provides information on financial information related to the Group's investment in the equity accounted joint venture APLNG.\n\n## B2.1 Sale of share of APLNG\n\nSubsequent to 31 December 2021, the Foreign Investment Review Board approved ConocoPhillips application to acquire an additional 10 per cent in APLNG from Origin, reducing Origin's interest from 37.5% to 27.5%. All conditions precedent under the share sale agreement between Origin and ConocoPhillips were satisfied and completion occurred on 18 February 2022.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Origin classified the portion of the asset to be divested as held for sale and recognised an impairment of $193 million to reduce the carrying value of the portion sold to its estimated fair value of $1,998 million.\n\nAt completion, this impairment was partially offset by a net gain of $80 million, outlined in the table below, resulting in the final net loss on divestment amounting to $113 million.\n\n|                                        | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Foreign currency translation reserve 1 | 105       |\n| FX hedging costs 2                     | (18)      |\n| Other completion adjustments           | (7)       |\n| Total completion adjustments           | 80        |\n\n- 1 An amount of $105 million was recycled to the income statement from the foreign currency translation reserve at completion.\n- 2 On execution of the previously announced transaction, US$285 million was hedged at a forward rate of AUD/USD 0.749. The net loss on the hedge contract on closing out the position amounted to $18 million.\n\nThe following amounts in notes B2.2, B2.3 and B2.4 reflect this change in ownership which was effective from 8 December 2021.",

At the same time, when APLNG paid interest to the Group on MRCPS, the amount was capitalised by APLNG. Therefore, these capitalised interest amounts form part of the cost of APLNG's assets and these assets have been depreciated since commencement of operations. The proportion attributable to the Group's own interest (37.5 per cent prior to 8 December 2021 and 27.5 per cent thereafter) is eliminated through the equity accounted investment balance.\n- 2 Includes a movement of $631 million in foreign exchange that has been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. This represents the net amount after $105 million was recycled to the income statement on divestment. Also included is a movement of A$433 million (US$303 million) relating to unfranked dividends received from APLNG.\n\nReporting date balances are converted from USD to AUD using an end-of-period exchange rate of 0.6891 (2021: 0.7516).\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's equity accounted investment in APLNG is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment or reversal of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made. The Group's assessment of the recoverable amount uses a discounted cash flow methodology and considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG price, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life. No impairment loss or reversal of impairment was recognised during the year.\n\nClimate change is a material risk that can affect the Group's operations through current and future climate-related legislation and policies and climate related scenarios. Future climate related conditions, legislation and policies may have an impact on future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, inflation, global market supply and demand conditions and whether reserve quantities are capable of economic extraction.",

The Group incurs costs in providing these services and charges APLNG for them in accordance with the terms of the contracts governing those services.\n\n## Commodity transactions\n\nSeparately, the Group has entered agreements to purchase gas from APLNG (2022: $401 million; 2021: $354 million) and sell gas to APLNG (2022: $17 million; 2021: $7 million). At 30 June 2022, the Group's outstanding payable balance for purchases from APLNG was $25 million (2021: $55 million) and outstanding receivable balance for sales to APLNG was $7 million (2021: $7 million).\n\n## Funding transactions\n\nThe Group recorded cash received of A$1,162 million (2021: $709 million) and reflected a reduction in the MRCPS non-current financial asset during the financial year. The related MRCPS dividend of A$50 million was recognised as interest income.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, the APLNG MRCPS were fully bought back and APLNG have commenced distributions via unfranked dividends of which $433 million were received during the year.\n\nDuring the year, Origin repaid $51 million (2021: $3 million) of the loan from APLNG under the APLNG project finance DSRA requirements.\n\n## Octopus Energy\n\n## Initial investment - deferred consideration and BOT milestone payments\n\nOn 1 May 2020, the Group announced the acquisition of a 20 per cent equity stake in Octopus Energy for a total cash consideration of \u00a3215 million (A$412 million), of which \u00a365 million was paid prior to 30 June 2020 and \u00a3150 million was deferred over two financial years. The Group has also entered into a licensing agreement for a total cash consideration of \u00a325 million, of which \u00a35 million was paid prior to 30 June 2020 and \u00a320 million was deferred over two financial years. During the year, the Group paid \u00a3100 million (A$189 million) to Octopus Energy in respect of the remaining deferred consideration payable under the equity purchase agreement. A further \u00a315 million (A$28 million) was also paid to Octopus Energy during the year, representing \u00a310 million of the remaining deferred consideration payable under the licensing agreement and an additional \u00a35 million which became payable on achievement of certain milestones.\n\n## Additional equity transactions\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Group committed an additional investment of \u00a338 million (~A$72 million) to maintain its 20 per cent equity interest, following the announcement of an investment into Octopus Energy by a fund managed by Generation Investment Management (GIM) for approximately a seven per cent interest in Octopus Energy. This amount was paid in October 2021 and was recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the Group's equity investment in Octopus Energy.\n\nIn December 2021, GIM obtained a further three per cent interest in Octopus Energy and Octopus Energy announced that the CPP Investment Board (CPPIB) agreed to acquire a six per cent stake in Octopus Energy for \u00a3211 million with completion of the CPPIB transaction occurring in two tranches. The first CPPIB tranche was completed in December 2021.\n\nThe GIM and CPPIB transactions in December 2021 resulted in a dilution of the Group's ownership in Octopus Energy to 18.7 per cent at 31 December 2021 and the Group has recognised a gain on dilution of $44 million in the current year.\n\nIn April 2022, \u00a34.5 million ($8 million) was paid to Octopus Energy in respect of our equity investment. The amount represents a tranche 2 milestone payment under the previous announced transaction between Tokyo Gas and Octopus and was required to maintain the Group's 18.7 per cent interest.\n\nOn 26 July 2022 Origin announced an additional investment of \u00a394 million (approximately A$163 million) to restore its 20 per cent equity interest.\n\n## Financial guarantee\n\nThe Group has provided a financial guarantee to Octopus Energy's financiers and during the year, $9 million (2021: $8 million) has been recognised within other income in respect of the financial guarantee income. The current financial guarantee expires in March 2023.",

Unbilled receivables represent estimated gas and electricity supplied to customers since their previous bill was issued. The carrying value of all receivables, including unbilled revenue, reflects the amount anticipated to be collected.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of trade receivables : Judgement is required in determining the level of provisioning for customer debts. Impairment allowances take into account the age of the debt, historic collection trends and expectations about future economic conditions.\n\nUnbilled revenue : Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectable until customers' meters are read and invoices issued. Refer to note A2 for judgement applied in determining the amount of unbilled energy revenue to recognise.\n\n## Credit risk and collectability\n\nThe Group minimises the concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers from across a broad range of industries. Credit approval processes are in place for large customers and all customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, settlement terms are generally 14 to 30 days from the date of the invoice. For some debtors, the Group may also obtain security in the form of deposits, guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letters of credit, which can be called upon if the counterparty defaults.\n\nDebtor collectability is assessed on an ongoing basis and any resulting impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for trade receivable and unbilled revenue impairment, which requires the expected lifetime credit losses to be recognised when the receivable is initially recognised. To measure expected lifetime credit losses, trade receivables and unbilled revenue balances have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and ageing profiles. A debtor balance is written off when recovery is no longer assessed to be possible.\n\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, the government introduced lockdowns and other restrictions to combat the spread of the virus, which has had a wide-ranging impact on businesses and individuals, with job losses and business shutdowns in certain industries. This has placed increased pressure on businesses' ability to absorb these impacts, and on consumer budgets. Collectively, this impacts the Group's debt collection performance and any expected credit losses. At the date of this report, the Group has not experienced a significant impact on its debt collection as a result of COVID-19.\n\nDespite this, there remains future credit risk associated with trade receivable amounts due to the unprecedented nature of this event, such that historical performance cannot be used in isolation as an indicator of the future. The impacts seen in other countries are not comparable due to different consumer patterns, demographics and responses to COVID-19, including the nature and quantum of government stimulus.",

The Group models the expected credit loss by customer type and industry group. Where possible, publicly available information, such as expected default rates, has been applied. For residential customers, a higher allowance for impairment is included for those with significantly aged receivables.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue is $186 million (2021: $186 million).\n\nThe average age of trade receivables is 18 days (2021: 19 days). Other receivables are neither past due nor impaired, and relate principally to generation and hedge contract receivables. The ageing of trade receivables and unbilled revenue at the reporting date is detailed below.\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2022                  | 2021   | 2021                  |\n|----------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| $m                   | Gross  | Impairment  allowance | Gross  | Impairment  allowance |\n| Unbilled revenue     | 2,120  | (13)                  | 1,465  | (21)                  |\n| Not yet due          | 539    | (8)                   | 380    | (8)                   |\n| Less than 30 days    | 86     | (5)                   | 105    | (7)                   |\n| 31-60 days past due  | 49     | (9)                   | 45     | (9)                   |\n| 61-90 days past due  | 30     | (8)                   | 30     | (9)                   |\n| Greater than 91 days | 238    | (143)                 | 207    | (132)                 |\n| Total                | 3,062  | (186)                 | 2,232  | (186)                 |\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue during the year is shown below.\n\n| Balance as at 1 July         | 186   | 162   |\n|------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Impairment losses recognised | 65    | 88    |\n| Amounts written off          | (65)  | (64)  |\n| Balance as at 30 June        | 186   | 186   |",

Expenditure incurred in each area of interest is accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all general exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred except the direct costs of acquiring the rights to explore, drilling exploratory wells and evaluating the results of drilling. These direct costs are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets pending the determination of the success of the well. If a well does not result in a successful discovery, the previously capitalised costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether any of the following indicators of impairment are present:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to explore has expired, or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;\n- \u00b7 further exploration for and evaluation of resources in the specific area is not budgeted or planned for;\n- \u00b7 the Group has decided to discontinue activities in the area; or\n- \u00b7 there is sufficient data to indicate the carrying value is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\n\nWhere an indicator of impairment exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. If it is concluded that the carrying value of an exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale, an impairment is recognised in the income statement for the difference.\n\n## Key judgement\n\n## Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets\n\nAssessment of the recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made as to future events and circumstances, particularly in relation to whether economic quantities of reserves have been discovered. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. Additionally, future climate-related conditions, legislation and policies may impact whether reserve quantities are capable of economic extraction. The recoverability of these assets continues to be monitored by the Group. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.\n\nUpon approval of the commercial development of a project, the exploration and evaluation asset is classified as a development asset. Once production commences, development assets are transferred to PP&E.",

Cost includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation.\n\nThe carrying amounts of assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Land and capital work in progress are not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation are shown below.\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings, including leasehold improvements 10 to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment 3 to 30 years",

ROU assets are initially valued at the corresponding lease liability amount adjusted for any payments already made, lease incentives received or initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease. Where the Group is required to restore the ROU asset at the end of the lease, the cost of restoration is also included in the value of the ROU asset.\n\nROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the ROU asset. The carrying amounts of ROU assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated, and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nRefer to note D2 for discussion of the recognition and measurement of associated lease liability balances.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of carrying values : Estimates of recoverable amounts are based on an asset's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. The recoverable amount of these assets is sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Refer to note C8 for further details.\n\nEstimation of useful economic lives : A technical assessment of the operating life of an asset requires significant judgement. Useful lives are amended prospectively when a change in the operating life is determined. The estimated useful lives of our assets align with our climate change strategy commitments.\n\nRestoration provisions : An asset's carrying value includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation activities. Refer to note C6 for a judgement related to restoration provisions.\n\nClimate change risks : Future climate-related conditions, legislation and policies may have an impact on these estimates and continues to be monitored.\n\nLease term : Where lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, the Group assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate will be exercised. Consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to extend or terminate the contract. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also included within this balance are rehabilitation provisions for contamination at existing and legacy operating sites.\n- 2 All contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits are deemed onerous and require a provision to be recognised up front. The opening balance included an onerous contract provision of $398 million (US$299 million) for the Cameron LNG purchase contract which has been released during the year. The closing balance relates to an onerous contract provision of $397 million (US$273 million) (30 June 2021: $13 million) for the LNG sales contract with ENN.\n- 3 The closing balance of other provisions primarily relates to costs for compliance with safety standard requirements relating to the Eraring ash dam wall, costs associated with the new Myuna Bay Recreation Centre facility, costs associated with the Eraring Power Station closure and a make good provision relating to existing property leases.\n\nRestoration provisions are initially recognised at the best estimate of the costs to be incurred in settling the obligation. Where restoration activities are expected to occur more than 12 months from the reporting period, the provision is discounted using a risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in each period as interest expense.\n\nAt each reporting date, the restoration provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, and changes to the timing or amount of costs to be incurred, based on current legal requirements and technology. Any changes in the estimated future costs associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Restoration and dismantling are added to or deducted from the related asset; and\n- \u00b7 Environmental rehabilitation are expensed in the current period.\n\n## Key estimate\n\n## Restoration, rehabilitation and dismantling costs\n\nThe Group estimates the cost of future site restoration activities at the time of installation or construction of an asset, or when an obligation arises. Restoration often does not occur for many years and thus significant judgement is required as to the extent of work, cost and timing of future activities. Future climate-related conditions, legislation and policies may have an impact on these estimates and will continue to be monitored.",

Subsequently, they are measured at either the amount of any determined loss allowance or at the amount initially recognised less any cumulative income recognised, whichever is larger. This financial guarantee relates to the working capital facility entered into by Octopus Energy with its financiers, as referred to in note B4, for which the Group has provided a guarantee.\n\n## C8 Impairment of non-current assets\n\n## Cash-generating units\n\nAssets are grouped together into the smallest group of individual assets that generate largely independent cash inflows (cash generating unit or (CGU)). The Energy Markets segment consists of the following materially distinct CGUs:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail CGU : incorporates Mass Market customers, Commercial & Industrial customers and the Wholesale & Trading businesses for electricity and natural gas commodities. The Wholesale & Trading business includes various electricity PPAs and major wholesale gas supply contracts.\n- \u00b7 Generation CGU : incorporates cash flows from Origin's power stations.\n- \u00b7 LPG CGU : supplies and distributes LPG to residential and business locations across Australia and the Pacific.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the CGUs are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, or where goodwill is present, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made.\n\nOnly the Retail CGU contains a material goodwill balance and an impairment assessment of the recoverable amount was performed at June 2022.\n\n## Impairment testing for the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nOrigin's assessment of the carrying value of its non-current assets in the Retail CGU considers a range of macroeconomic factors, including market prices for wholesale electricity and gas, large-scale generation certificates (LGCs), retail market dynamics, discount rates and costs.\n\nIn order to manage risk around the volatility of its energy supply costs, the Group enters into long-term and short-term derivative contracts. The recent extraordinary market conditions have resulted in a significant increase in wholesale electricity and gas prices and associated in-the-money derivative assets at 30 June 2022 (refer note D4).\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Retail CGU is assessed independently of the derivative cashflows which results in a cost of energy that is based on market prices and not the contracted hedged price. Accordingly, the higher assumed market prices have resulted in a non-cash impairment of $2,196 million recognised as at 30 June 2022.",

The impairment expense recognised by class of asset is outlined in the following table.\n\n| Impairment expense                             | Note   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current assets                             |        |           |           |\n| PP&E                                           | C3     | -         | 833       |\n| Intangible assets                              | C4     | 2,196     | 671       |\n| Total impairment expense on non-current assets | A4     | 2,196     | 1,504     |\n\nThe carrying amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Retail CGU is $1,943 million after the recognition of the impairment.\n\n## Recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Retail CGU has been determined using value-in-use models that include an appropriate terminal value. The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to a number of key assumptions requiring management judgement, including future commodity prices, regulatory policies, and the outlook for the market supply-and-demand conditions. The key assumptions used by the Group in its impairment assessment are shown in the table below.\n\n| Key assumptions                  | Energy Markets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity prices                 | Future commodity price assumptions impact the recoverability of carrying values and are reviewed at least twice annually.

Other Retail  CGU cash flows are projected for five years. The growth rate used to extrapolate Retail cash flows beyond the initial period  projected averages 2.3 per cent, analogous to long term Consumer Price Index.                                                     |\n| Customer numbers                 | This is based on a review of actual customer numbers and historical data regarding levels of customer churn.

Information is also presented about how the Group manages capital, and the various financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its operating and financing activities.\n\n## D1 Capital management\n\nThe Group's objective when managing capital is to make disciplined capital allocation decisions between investment in growth, distributions to shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure while maintaining access to capital. Management believes that a strong investment-grade credit rating (Baa2) and an appropriate level of net debt are required to meet these objectives. The Group's current credit rating is Baa2 (stable outlook) from Moody's.\n\nKey factors considered in determining the Group's capital structure and funding strategy at any point in time include expected operating cash flows, capital expenditure plans, the maturity profile of existing debt facilities, the dividend policy, and the ability to access funding from banks, capital markets and other sources.\n\nThe Group monitors its capital requirements through a number of metrics including the gearing ratio (target range of approximately 20 to 30 per cent) and an adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio (target range of 2.0x to 3.0x). These targets are consistent with attaining a strong investment-grade rating. Underlying EBITDA is a non-statutory (non-IFRS) measure.\n\nThe gearing ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted net debt plus total equity. Net debt, which excludes cash held by Origin to fund APLNG-related operations, is adjusted to take into account the effect of FX hedging transactions on the Group's foreign currency debt obligations. The adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted underlying EBITDA (Origin's underlying EBITDA less Origin's share of APLNG underlying EBITDA plus net cash flow from APLNG) over the relevant rolling 12-month period.\n\nThe Group monitors its current and future funding requirements for at least the next five years and regularly assesses a range of funding alternatives to meet these requirements in advance of when the funds are required.\n\n|                                                                | 2022 $m   | 2021 1 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Borrowings                                                     | 2,855     | 4,765       |\n| Lease liabilities                                              | 535       | 463         |\n| Total interest-bearing liabilities                             | 3,390     | 5,228       |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents excluding APLNG-related cash 2 | (572)     | (442)       |\n| Net debt                                                       | 2,818     | 4,786       |\n| Fair value adjustments on FX hedging transactions              | 20        | (147)       |\n| Adjusted net debt                                              | 2,838     | 4,639       |\n| Total equity                                                   | 10,022    | 9,475       |\n| Total capital                                                  | 12,860    | 14,114      |\n| Gearing ratio                                                  | 22%       | 33%         |\n| Ratio of adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA       | 1.9x      | 2.9x        |\n\n- 1 Certain amounts have been restated to reflect adjustments disclosed in note G11.\n- 2 This balance excludes $48 million (2021: $30 million) of cash held by Origin, as upstream operator, to fund APLNG-related operations.\n\nThe Group has undertaken a bank debt extension during the year ended 30 June 2022. This activity has been aimed at strengthening the capital profile by extending the weighted average tenor of the Group's debt portfolio.\n\nA summary of key transactions is shown below.\n\n## Bank debt facility extension\n\n13 December 2021 - extended the maturity dates of $2.4 billion of bank debt facilities from FY2024/FY2025 to FY2026/FY2027.\n\n## Refinance of bank guarantee facilities\n\n13 April 2022 - extended the maturity dates of A$500 million of bank guarantee facilities from FY2023/FY2025 to FY2025/FY2026.\n\n## Debt maturity\n\n30 September 2021 - repaid the \u20ac800 million eight-year note issued under the Euro Medium Term Note program. The notes had been swapped to A$1,164 million.\n\n13 October 2021 - repaid US$500 million ten-year 144a note.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\n1 April 2022 to 22 June 2022 - Origin incurred A$250 million on a share buy-back with 38.5 million shares bought back at an average price of A$6.50 per share.",

After that date, the liability is amortised to face value at maturity using an effective interest rate method.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Where a lease includes termination and/or extension options, the impact of these options on the amount of future payments is included where exercise of such options is considered reasonably certain to occur. Interest expense is charged on outstanding lease liabilities that reduce over time as periodic payments are made.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when certain events occur, including changes in the lease term or changes in future lease payments such as those resulting from inflation-linked indexation or market rate rent reviews. On remeasurement of lease liabilities, a corresponding adjustment is made to the ROU asset.\n\nThe contractual maturity of lease liabilities is disclosed within the liquidity table in note D4.\n\nThe contractual maturities of non-current borrowings are as set out below.\n\n|                              | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| One to two years             | 123       | 237       |\n| Two to five years            | 508       | 534       |\n| Over five years              | 1,967     | 2,056     |\n| Total non-current borrowings | 2,598     | 2,827     |\n\nSome of the Group's borrowings are subject to terms that allow the lender to call on the debt in the event of a breach of covenants.

These risks are grouped into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit : The risk that a counterparty will not fulfil its financial obligations under a contract or other arrangement.\n- \u00b7 Market : The risk that fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates will adversely impact the Group's result.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity : The risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\n\n| Risk      | Sources                                                          | Risk management framework                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Financial exposure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit    | Sale of goods  and services and  hedging activities              | The Board approves credit risk  management policies that determine the  level of exposures it is prepared to accept. It  also allocates credit limits to counterparties  based on publicly available credit  information from recognised providers  where available.                   | Notes C1, C7 and D4 disclose the carrying amounts of  financial assets, which represent the Group's maximum  exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. The Group  utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association  (ISDA) agreements to limit exposure to credit risk by  netting amounts receivable from and payable to individual  counterparties (refer to note G8). |\n| Market    | Purchase and sale  of commodities and  funding risks             | The Board approves policies that ensure  the Group is not exposed to excess  risk from market volatility. These policies  include active hedging of price and volume  exposures within prescribed cash flow at  risk and value at risk limits.                                         | See below for further discussion of market risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Liquidity | Ongoing business  obligations and new  investment  opportunities | The Group centrally manages its liquidity  position through cash flow forecasting  and maintenance of minimum levels of  liquidity determined by the Board. The  debt portfolio is periodically reviewed to  ensure there is funding flexibility and an  appropriate maturity profile. | Analysis of the Group's liquidity profile as at the reporting  date is presented at the end of this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |",

The table below summarises these risks by nature of exposure and provides information about the risk mitigation strategies being applied.\n\n| Nature           | Sources of financial exposure                                                                                                                                       | Risk management strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity price  | Future commercial transactions and recognised assets and  liabilities exposed to changes in electricity, oil, gas, coal or  environmental scheme certificate prices | Due to vertical integration, a significant portion of the  Group's spot electricity purchases from the NEM are  naturally hedged by generation sales into the NEM at  spot prices. The Group manages its remaining exposure  to commodity price fluctuations beyond Board-approved  limits using a mix of commercial contracts (such as  fixed-price purchase contracts) and derivative instruments  (described below).                                                            |\n| Foreign exchange | Foreign-denominated borrowings and investments (e.g.,  APLNG MRCPS) and future foreign currency denominated  commercial transactions                                | The Group limits its exposure to changes in foreign  exchange rates through forward foreign exchange  contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps. In certain  circumstances, borrowings are left in a foreign currency, or  swapped from one foreign currency to another, to hedge  expected future business cash flows in that currency.  Significant foreign-denominated transactions undertaken  in the normal course of operations are managed on a  case-by-case basis. |\n| Interest rate    | Variable-rate borrowings (cash flow risk) and fixed-rate borrowings  (fair value risk)                                                                              | Interest rate exposures are kept within an acceptable range  as determined by the Board. Risk limits are managed  through a combination of fixed-rate and fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Derivatives to manage market risks\n\nDerivative instruments are contracts with values that are derived from an underlying price index (or other variable) that require little or no initial net investment, and that are settled at a future date.\n\nThe Group uses the following types of derivative instruments to mitigate market risk.\n\n| Forwards                         | A contract documenting the underlying reference rate (such as benchmark price or exchange rate) to be paid or received on  a notional principal obligation at a future date.                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Futures                          | An exchange-traded contract to buy or sell an asset for an agreed price at a future date. Futures are net-settled in cash without  physical delivery of the underlying asset.                                                                                              |\n| Swaps                            | A contract in which two parties exchange a series of cash flows for another (such as fixed-for-floating interest rate).                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Options                          | A contract in which the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) an instrument at  a fixed price in the future. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction if the buyer exercises the option. |\n| Structured  electricity products | A non-standardised contract, generally with an energy market participant, to acquire long-term capacity. These contracts  typically contain features similar to swaps and call options.                                                                                    |\n\nDerivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Movements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative.\n\nThe method of recognising changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated in an 'accounting' hedge relationship. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are referred to as 'economic' hedges.\n\nFair value gains and losses attributable to economic hedges are recognised in the income statement and resulted in a $1,153 million gain (2021: $377 million loss) for the year. Fair value gains and losses attributable to accounting hedges are discussed in the Hedge Accounting section.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is Origin Energy Limited. Tax funding arrangement amounts are recognised as inter-entity amounts.\n\nIncome tax expense is made up of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax expense represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using current tax rates and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax expense reflects the temporary differences between the accounting carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.",

Uncertainty arises due to the possibility that changes in tax law or other future circumstances can impact the tax balances recognised in the financial statements. Ultimate outcomes may vary.\n\nDeferred taxes : The recognition of deferred tax balances requires judgement as to whether it is probable such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future and there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the benefits can be utilised.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in joint ventures unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. During the year, the Group recognised a deferred tax expense of $39 million (2021: $669 million) in respect of the investment in APLNG, representing carried forward equity accounted earnings that are expected to be distributed to Origin via dividends from APLNG in the foreseeable of future. In determining the forecast distributions from APLNG, the Group's assessment of future cash flows considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG prices, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group has recognised a deferred tax liability of $708 million. The remaining unbooked balance is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future through the payment of future dividends, through sale or through a capital return. The unrecognised portion is disclosed in note E2.\n\n## Income tax expense recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                        | 2022   | 2022    | 2022   | 2021   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| $m                                                     | Gross  | Tax     | Net    | Gross  | Tax    | Net    |\n| Actuarial gain on defined benefit  superannuation plan | 1      | -       | 1      | 4      | (1)    | 3      |\n| Investment valuation changes                           | 4      | (1)     | 3      | (8)    | 2      | (6)    |\n| Foreign currency translation reserve:                  |        |         |        |        |        |        |\n| Reclassified to income statement                       | (103)  | -       | (103)  | -      | -      | -      |\n| Translation of foreign operations                      | 584    | 14      | 598    | (623)  | (16)   | (639)  |\n| Cash flow hedges:                                      |        |         |        |        |        |        |\n| Reclassified to income statement                       | (443)  | 133     | (310)  | 130    | (39)   | 91     |\n| Effective portion of change in fair value              | 3,407  | (1,022) | 2,385  | 509    | (153)  | 356    |\n| Other comprehensive income for the year                | 3,450  | (876)   | 2,574  | 12     | (207)  | (195)  |\n\n## E2 Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax balances arise when there are temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than where:\n\n- \u00b7 the difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 temporary differences arise on initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The acquisition adds embedded electricity network and serviced hot water customers to Origin's community energy services business. Considering the timing of the transaction and the size of the operations, the overall impact of the acquisition to the Group's consolidated revenue and profit and loss since the acquisition date, is not significant.\n\nPurchase consideration of $105 million was paid to acquire the net assets on the completion date. Considering the acquired cash balance of $13 million the net cash impact from the acquisition was $92 million in the current year.\n\nThe purchase consideration of $92 million has been recognised in investing cashflow.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Origin has agreed to amendments to its Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Intellihub which has included an increase the current meter volume commitment. Origin received a one-off payment of $67 million excluding GST ($74 million inclusive of GST) which has been recognised upfront as Other Income.\n\n|                                        | 2022 $m Fair value 1   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Purchase consideration                 | 105                    |\n| Cash acquired                          | (13)                   |\n| Acquisition related cashflow           | 92                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents              | 13                     |\n| Trade and other receivables            | 17                     |\n| PP&E                                   | 24                     |\n| Customer related intangible assets     | 77                     |\n| Trade and other payables               | (26)                   |\n| Deferred tax liability                 | (25)                   |\n| Fair value of net assets acquired      | 80                     |\n| Purchase consideration                 | 105                    |\n| Less fair value of net assets acquired | (80)                   |\n| Goodwill recognised on consolidation   | 25                     |\n\n## F3 Joint arrangements and investments in associates\n\nJoint arrangements are entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring the consent of two or more parties for strategic, financial and operating decisions. The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on its rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangements.\n\nAssociates are entities, other than partnerships, for which the Group exercises significant influence, but no control, over the financial and operating policies, and which are not intended for sale in the near future.\n\nOf the Group's interests in joint arrangements and associates, only APLNG and Octopus Energy have a material impact on the Group at 30 June 2022 (refer to Section B).\n\n## Interests in unincorporated joint operations\n\nThe Group's interests in unincorporated joint operations are brought to account on a line-by-line basis in the income statement and statement of financial position. These interests are held on the following assets whose principal activities are oil and/or gas exploration, development and production; power generation; and geothermal power technology:\n\n- \u00b7 Beetaloo Basin\n- \u00b7 Browse Basin\n- \u00b7 Canning Basin\n- \u00b7 Innamincka Deeps Geothermal\n- \u00b7 Cooper-Eromanga Basin",

In some circumstances, the Group may incur more than its proportionate share of such liabilities, but will have the right to recover the excess liability from the other joint arrangement participants.\n\nThe Group continues to provide parent company guarantees in excess of its 27.5 per cent shareholding in APLNG, in respect of certain historical domestic contracts.\n\nIn October 2018, Origin and the other APLNG shareholders agreed to indemnify one of APLNG's long-term LNG customers (following that customer's election to defer delivery of 30 cargoes over six years (2019-24)) should APLNG fail to supply make-up cargoes to that customer prior to the expiry of the LNG supply contract. The customer will pay APLNG for the deferred cargoes and APLNG expects to resell the gas to other customers, and deliver the deferred cargoes to the long-term LNG customer between 2025 and the end of the LNG supply contract. The indemnity was provided severally in accordance with each shareholder's proportionate shareholding in APLNG. At the inception of the agreement, any obligation or liability on the part of the shareholders will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events, and cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nThe Group has entered into an agreement to provide a financial guarantee to Octopus Energy's financiers in respect of a working capital facility entered into by Octopus Energy. Under this agreement, the Group is required to make a payment to Octopus Energy's financiers should Octopus Energy not make payments under the working capital facility. In return, Octopus Energy is required to pay a monthly fee to the Group in respect of the guarantee facility. The guarantee has been accounted for as a Financial Guarantee Contract under AASB 9 Financial Instruments and is carried at fair value (refer to note C7) with reference to the guarantee amount in the facility agreement.\n\n## Legal and regulatory\n\nCertain entities within the Group (and joint venture entities, such as APLNG) are subject to various lawsuits and claims as well as audits and reviews by government, regulatory bodies or other joint venture partners. In most instances, it is not possible to reasonably predict the outcome of these matters or their impact on the Group. Where outcomes can be reasonably predicted, provisions are recorded.\n\nA number of sites owned/operated (or previously owned/operated) by the Group have been identified as potentially contaminated. For sites where it is likely that a present obligation exists, and it is probable that an outflow of resource will be required to settle the obligation, such costs have been expensed or provided for.\n\nWarranties and indemnities have also been given and/or received by entities in the Group in relation to environmental liabilities for certain properties divested and/or acquired.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nAs part of the acquisition of Browse Basin exploration permits in 2015, the Group agreed to pay cash consideration of US$75 million contingent upon a project Final Investment Decision (FID), and US$75 million contingent upon first production. The Group will pay further contingent consideration of up to US$50 million upon first production if 2P reserves, at the time of the FID, reach certain thresholds. These obligations have not been provided for at the reporting date as they are dependent upon uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control.\n\n## Bank guarantees\n\nThere are no contingent liabilities arising from bank guarantees held by the Group that are required to be disclosed as at the reporting date, as these have either been provided for, or an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote.\n\nThe Group's share of guarantees for certain contractual commitments of its joint ventures is shown at note G2.\n\n## AEMO administered and suspended market\n\nDuring the period of administered pricing and market suspension, an administered price cap was imposed. Generators were entitled to claim compensation through the Australian Energy Market Commission for losses incurred as a result of the administered price cap. Origin has lodged a notice of its intent to claim direct costs and opportunity costs as a result of the price cap. During the period of administered pricing and market suspension, AEMO issued directions to generators to supply electricity as needed. Generators directed on by AEMO during this period were entitled to directions compensation.\n\nCompensation to be paid to generators is still in the process of being determined. AEMO will seek to recover these compensation costs from retailers. These compensation payments and costs have not been recognised for at the reporting date as they are still in the process of being determined and therefore not wholly within the Group's control and cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.",

Participation in the plan is at the Board's discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate or to receive any guaranteed benefits. Equity incentives granted prior to FY2018 were offered in the form of Options and/or Share Rights. From FY2019 onwards, equity incentives are granted in the form of Share Rights and/or Restricted Shares (RSs). Only RSs carry dividend and voting entitlements. To the extent that Share Rights ultimately vest, a dividend equivalent mechanism operates.\n\n## (i) Short Term Incentive\n\nShort Term Incentive (STI) includes the award of RSs, which are subject to trading restrictions for a set period of time (generally up to two years), after which they become unrestricted, provided that the employee remains employed with satisfactory performance. Once unrestricted, the shares are transferred into the employee's name at no cost. The face value of RSs measured at grant date is recognised as an employee expense over the related service period. RSs are forfeited if the service and performance conditions are not met. 1\n\n## (ii) Long Term Incentive\n\nThe Long Term Incentive (LTI) awards include the award of Share Rights, which vest subject to performance conditions. Generally half of each LTI award is made in the form of Performance Share Rights (PSRs) and is subject to a market hurdle, namely Origin's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a Reference Group of ASX-listed companies, as identified in the 2022 Remuneration Report. The remaining half of each LTI award is made in the form of Restricted Share Rights (RSRs), where vesting is subject to Board assessment with reference to a suite of underpinning conditions , as set out in the 2022 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe number of awards that may vest are considered separately for PSRs and RSRs. For the PSR awards, which are subject to the relative TSR hurdle, vesting only occurs if Origin's TSR over the performance period ranks higher than the 50th percentile of the Reference Group. Half of the PSRs vest if that condition is satisfied. All the PSRs vest if Origin ranks at or above the 75th percentile of the Reference Group. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between these two points. The PSR grants made in FY2022 have a performance period of three years. Vesting is into RSs with a trading restriction for a further two years (total deferral five years). For the RSR awards, the Board will determine the vesting outcome shortly before each of three progressive vesting dates at years three, four and five by reference to a broad range of performance indicators. Vesting is into RSs which all have trading restrictions until the end of the fifth year.\n\nPrior to FY2021, the LTI awards include the award of PSRs, such that half of the award is subject to the TSR hurdle, and the remaining half of each LTI award is subject to an internal hurdle, namely Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), as set out in the relevant remuneration report.\n\nFor awards granted in FY2019 and FY2020 that are subject to the ROCE hurdle, half of the ROCE tranche is allocated to Energy Markets and the other half to Integrated Gas. Each tranche will be tested separately and vest separately. Vesting for each tranche only occurs if the average actual annual ROCE outcomes over the performance period for the relevant business meets or exceeds the average of the annual ROCE targets, which are reflective of delivering WACC for the relevant business. Half of the relevant PSRs will vest if the ROCE target is met. All the relevant PSRs will vest if the ROCE target is exceeded by two percentage points or more. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between.\n\nVested share rights are automatically exercised upon vesting, and there is no exercise price. Upon exercise, a vested award is converted into one fully paid ordinary share that is subject to a post-vesting holding lock for a set period (generally up to two years) and carries voting and dividend entitlements.",

In exceptional circumstances 2 , unvested Share Rights may be held 'on foot' subject to the specified performance hurdles and other plan conditions being met, or dealt with in an appropriate manner determined by the Board.\n\nFor PSRs subject to the relative TSR condition, fair value is measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, share price at grant date, price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate for the term of the security, and the likelihood of meeting the TSR market condition.\n\nThe expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest except where due to non-achievement of the TSR market condition. Set out below are the inputs used to determine the fair value of the PSRs granted during the year.\n\nFor RSRs subject to the underpinning conditions, the initial fair value at grant date is the market value of an Origin share, and the recognised expense is trued up at each reporting period to the expected outcome as assessed at that time.\n\nSet out below is a summary of RSRs and PSRs issued during the financial year.\n\n|                                   | RSRs        | RSRs        | PSRs        | PSRs        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Grant date                        | 06 Sep 2021 | 20 Oct 2021 | 06 Sep 2021 | 20 Oct 2021 |\n| Grant date share price            | $4.44       | $5.14       | $4.44       | $5.14       |\n| Exercise price                    | Nil         | Nil         | Nil         | Nil         |\n| Volatility                        | -           | -           | 37%         | 37%         |\n| Risk-free rate 1                  | -           | -           | 0.15%       | 0.51%       |\n| Grant date fair value (per award) | $4.44       | $5.14       | $2.46       | $3.58       |\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan awards outstanding\n\nSet out below is a summary of awards outstanding at the beginning and end of the financial year.\n\n|                             | Options   | Weighted average exercise price   | PSRs      | RSRs      | DSRs    | RSs       |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2021  | 3,105,221 | $6.32                             | 5,670,304 | 995,169   | 45,556  | 6,695,155 |\n| Granted                     | -         | -                                 | 1,296,535 | 1,311,963 | -       | 4,929,061 |\n| Exercised/released          | -         | -                                 | 397,663   | -         | 45,556  | 3,156,022 |\n| Forfeited                   | 1,882,339 | -                                 | 2,236,713 | 48,834    | -       | 467,068   |\n| Outstanding at 30 June 2022 | 1,222,882 | $7.37                             | 4,332,463 | 2,258,298 | -       | 8,001,126 |\n| Exercisable at 30 June 2022 | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -       |           |\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2020  | 3,259,381 | $6.33                             | 6,243,467 | -         | 213,038 | 4,523,573 |\n| Granted                     | -         | -                                 | 1,044,581 | 1,056,609 | -       | 4,216,362 |\n| Exercised/released          | -         | -                                 | 563,432   | -         | 167,482 | 1,758,548 |\n| Forfeited                   | 154,160   | -                                 | 1,054,312 | 61,440    | -       | 286,232   |\n| Outstanding at 30 June 2021 | 3,105,221 | $6.32                             | 5,670,304 | 995,169   | 45,556  | 6,695,155 |\n| Exercisable at 30 June 2021 | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -       | -         |\n\nThe weighted average share price during 2022 was $5.45 (2021: $4.75).

The shares are granted for no consideration. Shares awarded under the GESP are purchased on market, registered in the name of the employee, and are restricted for three years, or until cessation of employment, whichever occurs first.\n\nUnder the MSP, all eligible employees may elect to purchase shares via a salary sacrifice arrangement, which commences on 1 October of the performance year. The shares under this plan are allotted quarterly and are subject to a trading restriction for a set period (generally two years) or until cessation of employment. The Company matches the purchased shares on a one-for-two basis with allocation of additional Matching Rights (MRs) which vest at the same time as the restriction is lifted for the purchased shares. Vesting of MRs is conditional on the employee remaining in continuous employment at that time. MRs are forfeited if the service conditions are not met. 3\n\nDetails of the shares awarded under the GESP during the year are set out below. The cost per share represents the weighted average market price of the Company's shares on the grant date.\n\n|      |       | Grant date   | Shares granted   | Cost per share   | Total cost $'000   |\n|------|-------|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| 2022 |       | 6 Sep 2021   | 813,637          | $4.36            | 3,547              |\n|      | Total |              | 813,637          |                  | 3,547              |\n| 2021 |       | 28 Aug 2020  | 703,794          | $5.49            | 3,864              |\n|      | Total |              | 703,794          |                  | 3,864              |\n\nSet out below is a summary of MRs outstanding at the beginning and end of the financial year.\n\n|                             | MRs     |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2021  | 375,895 |\n| Granted                     | 267,619 |\n| Exercised/released          | 219,688 |\n| Forfeited                   | 24,926  |\n| Outstanding at 30 June 2022 | 398,900 |\n| Exercisable at 30 June 2022 | -       |",

As part of the acquisition of Octopus Energy and the associated retail transformation process, an external consulting firm was engaged by the Group to undertake advisory services in respect of this acquisition. In June 2020, midway through the project, the firm engaged by the Group was acquired by EY. As the Group decided it was in the best interest for the project to continue, the audit committee agreed to a one-off approval allowing for continuation of the work, provided the time period and fees were limited. This project completed in the prior year and therefore these costs will not reoccur going forward.",

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a net amount payable by one party to the other.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain circumstances, such as a loan default or the termination of a contract.\n\nThe following table presents the recognised financial instruments that are offset, or subject to master netting arrangements but not offset, as at the reporting date. The net amount column shows the impact on the Group's statement of financial position if all set-off rights were exercised.\n\n|                          | Gross amount $m   | Amount offset in  the statement of  financial  position $m   | Amount in the statement  of financial  position $m   | Related amount not offset $m   | Net amount $m   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2022                     |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets        | 9,855             | (3,606)                                                      | 6,249                                                | (2,070)                        | 4,179           |\n| Derivative liabilities   | (6,940)           | 3,606                                                        | (3,334)                                              | 2,070                          | (1,264)         |\n| 2021                     |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets        | 1,488             | (353)                                                        | 1,135                                                | (867)                          | 268             |\n| Derivative liabilities 1 | (2,489)           | 353                                                          | (2,136)                                              | 867                            | (1,269)         |\n\n- 1 Certain amounts have been restated to reflect adjustments disclosed in note G11.\n\n## G9 Deed of Cross Guarantee\n\nThe parent entity has entered into a Deed of Cross Guarantee through which the Group guarantees the debts of certain controlled entities in the event that one of those entities is wound up.

Refer to note F1.\n\n## G11 Prior year restatements\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nFollowing clarifying guidance from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), the Group has applied changes in accounting policies that require restatement of previously reported amounts.\n\n## SaaS\n\nThe net intangibles assets of $40 million have been derecognised in the statement of financial position at 30 June 2021 and the associated retained earnings amount of $29 million (after tax) has been restated.\n\nThe associated amortisation of $9 million (before tax) for the period has been reversed in the income statement as at 30 June 2021.\n\n## PPAs\n\nIn the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group recognised an impairment of goodwill allocated to the Energy Markets Retail cash generating unit (CGU) amounting to $830 million, and the cash flows associated with the renewable PPAs were included in the calculation of the recoverable amount for the Retail CGU. This change in the Group's accounting policy to recognise PPAs as derivatives has resulted in an adjustment of $324 million to reverse a portion of the impairment of goodwill recorded at 30 June 2021, relating to the renewable PPAs that were included in the recoverable amount.\n\nThe net electricity derivative liabilities of $889 million have been recognised as derivatives in the statement of financial position at 30 June 2021 and the associated retained earnings amount of $298 million (after tax) have been restated.\n\n## Other restatements\n\nCertain amounts have been restated to reflect an adjustment to the result of the equity accounted investment in Octopus Energy.",

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board ' s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.",

The Group assesses the recoverable amount of each CGU using a discounted cash flow forecast to determine value in use.\n\nAs disclosed in Note C8 to the financial statements, as a result of increased forecast wholesale electricity and gas prices, the Group has recognised a $2,196 million impairment charge on its Retail CGU, which form part of the Energy Markets group of CGUs.\n\nAssumptions used in the forecasting of cash flows are highly judgmental and inherently subjective. As disclosed in Note C8, small changes in key assumptions can lead to significant changes in the recoverable amount of these assets.\n\nAs a result, we considered the impairment testing of the Energy Markets group of CGUs and the related disclosures in the financial report to be particularly significant to our audit.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the impairment testing methodology for the Energy Markets group of CGUs used by the Group met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 A ssessed the basis for the determination of the Group's CGUs based on our understanding of the nature of the Group's business, the interdependence of cash flows, and the economic environment in which it operates.\n- \u00b7 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow models.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical budgeting accuracy and current trading performance, historical growth rates, historical operating results, market data and forecasts, ratio analysis, and discussions with management and senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Where long term supply or sales contracts are in place, agreed the forecast revenue and costs to the contract terms and rates.\n- \u00b7 For the Generation CGU within the Energy Markets Group of CGUs, compared the useful lives of assets assumed in the impairment model to the Australian Energy Market Operator (' AEMO ') closure dates.\n- \u00b7 Involved our energy market modelling specialists to assess the conclusions reached by the Group's internal specialists in respect of forecast energy prices, forecast generation volumes, forecast capacity prices and marginal loss factors.\n- \u00b7 Involved our valuation specialists to:\n- o Assess the discount rates, growth rates and terminal growth rates with reference to publicly available information on comparable companies in the industry and markets in which the Group operates; and\n- o Perform sensitivity analyses and evaluated whether any reasonably possible changes in assumptions could cause the carrying amount of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.\n- \u00b7 Considered the potential impacts of climate risk on the recoverable amount by analysing the forecast energy price assumptions applied by management, asset useful lives and the possible changes to commodity prices resulting from the transition to a low carbon future.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosure in the financial report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has concluded that no impairment or impairment reversal was required.\n\nAs disclosed in Note B2.3, the carrying amount of the Group's equity accounted investment in APLNG is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indicators of impairment or impairment reversal. Where an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made.\n\nOil price is a significant assumption used in this assessment and is inherently subjective.  In times of economic uncertainty, including the current political and energy supply uncertainty which results from the Ukraine war, the degree of subjectivity in determining forecast pricing is higher than it might otherwise be.  Changes in this assumption can lead to significant changes in the recoverable amount.\n\nDue to the significance of this investment relative to total assets and the inherent complexity in forecasting  commodity  prices  and  future  market outlooks,  we  considered  the  carrying  value  of  this investment to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn fulfilling our responsibilities as Group auditor, we considered the work performed by the EY Component Auditor responsible for auditing APLNG.  This included:\n\n- \u00b7 Sending instructions to the EY Component Auditor detailing the scope to be covered for the purposes of our audit of the Group.  This included the risk associated with impairment or impairment reversal.\n- \u00b7 The Component Auditor confirmed compliance with the instructions provided and reported the results of their procedures to us.\n- \u00b7 To ensure sufficient oversight, we, as the Group audit team:\n- o Held frequent meetings with the Component Auditor to discuss the outcome and extent of their procedures.\n- o Reviewed underlying working papers and documentation of the Component Auditor for selected areas of audit focus.\n\nIn addition, we undertook the following additional procedures with the assistance of our valuation's experts:\n\n- \u00b7 Considered whether information existed that was contrary to the EY Component auditor's conclusion in respect of the existence of impairment or impairment reversal for APLNG at 30 June 2022 and may represent objective evidence of a significant or prolonged change in value of the investment, including:\n- o Compared current period results from APLNG to prior period impairment modelling.\n- o Considered changes to market conditions during the period including changes and volatility in key macro-economic assumptions such as oil price and gas price with reference to broker and analyst data and publicly available peer company information.\n- o Evaluated possible changes to the APLNG discount rate with reference to external market data including government bond rates and comparable company data.\n- o Considered the impact of climate risk on the asset life and key macro-economic assumptions.\n- o Undertook sensitivity analysis for reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which included price sensitivity analysis using scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency.\n- \u00b7 Considered available market information including trading and reserve multiples as a cross check of the carrying value of the Group's equity accounted investment.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the climate related disclosures in respect of APLNG for accuracy and consistency with other publicly disclosed information.",

Key factors that require consideration impacting the complex estimation process include:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimation of customer demand which is impacted by weather and an individual customer's circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Application of different customer rates across different regulated and unregulated markets.\n- \u00b7 Changes in energy consumption patterns compared to the same period in the prior year, particularly due to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and wholesale energy price volatility.\n\nThe Group's disclosures in respect of the unbilled revenue estimation process are included in Note C1 of the financial report.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the methodology used to recognise unbilled revenue met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the effectiveness of the Group's controls governing energy purchased, energy sold and the customer pricing process.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the unbilled revenue calculation by :\n- o With the assistance of specialists, assessing the calculation methodology and mathematical accuracy.\n- o Comparing inputs used in the calculation to supporting data such as historical temperature data and volume data provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).\n- o Compared the prices applied to customer consumption with historical and current data.\n- o Reviewed the Group's reconciliation of volumes acquired from AEMO against volumes sold and volumes purchased as used by the Group in their analysis.\n- o Compared the accuracy of the unbilled revenue accrual by comparing the historical accrual to final billing data and performing a trend analysis of the accrual year on year.\n- o Tested the accuracy of the unbilled revenue accrual for business customers by comparing the unbilled revenue accrual to subsequent invoices.\n- Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial report including those made with respect to judgements and estimates\n\n\u00b7\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Report and A uditor's Report Thereon\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's 2022 annual report, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group ' s internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors ' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group ' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor ' s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor ' s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

A detailed breakdown of movements in Origin's share of APLNG 2P reserves is as follows:\n- - 240 PJ (7 per cent) upward revision of operated 2P reserves before production driven by updated reservoir models reflecting strong field performance and new data insights;\n- - 37 PJ (6 per cent) increase in non-operated 2P reserves before production; and\n- - (220) PJ of production.\n- \u00b7 Excluding divestment of Origin equity in APLNG, 2P reserves replacement of 99 per cent has been achieved in operated fields over the last five years, primarily driven by strong performance in producing fields, along with continued maturation of contingent areas shown to be feasible for development through appraisal activities.\n- \u00b7 Developed 2P reserves accounted for 60 per cent of total 2P reserves as at 30 June 2022.\n- \u00b7 Origin's share of 1P (proved) reserves has continued to grow, with an increase of 7 per cent or 197 PJ before production due to strong performance in producing fields. 1P reserves represent 59 per cent of total 3P (proved plus probable plus possible) reserves as at 30 June 2022.\n\n## 1.2 2P reserves (Origin share)\n\n2P reserves decreased by 1,104 PJ after divestment, revisions and production to a total of 3,148 PJ, compared to 30 June 2021.\n\n## Origin 2P reserves by area\n\n| (PJ)                | 2P 30/06/2021   | Acquisition/ divestment   | New booking/ discovery   |   Revisions/ extensions | Production   | 2P 30/06/2022   |\n|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Operated Assets     | 3,587           | (984)                     | -                        |                     240 | (170)        | 2,673           |\n| - Asset East        | 1,463           | (390)                     | -                        |                     110 | (86)         | 1,097           |\n| - Asset West        | 2,124           | (594)                     | -                        |                     130 | (84)         | 1,576           |\n| Non-Operated Assets | 665             | (177)                     | -                        |                      37 | (50)         | 475             |\n| Total 2P            | 4,252           | (1,161)                   | -                        |                     277 | (220)        | 3,148           |\n\n- \u00b7 Summary of 2P reserves movement - key changes include:\n- - 220 PJ decrease due to production;\n- - 1,161 PJ decrease due to divestment, largely related to Origin's equity decrease from 37.5% to 27.5% (-1,134 PJ) but also including APLNG's divestment of the Woleebee and Mahalo fields (-27 PJ);\n- - 240 PJ positive revision across all operated areas, reflecting;\n- - Updated reservoir models reflecting strong field performance and new step-out data acquisition resulting in an increase in estimated recovery, notably from Combabula-Reedy Creek area this year.\n- - 37 PJ increase in non-operated areas.\n- \u00b7 As at 30 June 2022, developed 2P reserves represented 60 per cent of total 2P reserves.\n- \u00b7 As at 30 June 2022, 100 per cent of Origin's share of 2P reserves are unconventional gas located in the Surat and Bowen Basins.",

        "page_content": "## Appendix B: Notes relating to this report\n\n## a. Methodology regarding reserves and resources\n\nThe Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) 2018 published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). This document may be downloaded from the SPE website: https://www.spe.org/en/industry/ reserves/. Additionally, this Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the ASX reporting guidelines. For all assets, Origin reports reserves and resources consistent with SPE guidelines as follows: proved reserves (1P); proved plus probable reserves (2P); proved plus probable plus possible reserves (3P) and best estimate contingent resource (2C). Reserves must be discovered, recoverable, commercial and remaining.\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or prepared by Origin. The reserves and resources estimates contained in this report have been prepared in accordance with the standards, definitions and guidelines contained within the PRMS and generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles as set out in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards.\n\nOrigin does not intend to report prospective or undiscovered resources as defined by the SPE in any of its areas of interest on an ongoing basis.\n\n## b. Economic test for reserves\n\nThe assessment of reserves requires a commercial test to establish that reserves can be economically recovered. Within the commercial test, operating cost and capital cost estimates are combined with fiscal regimes and product pricing to confirm the economic viability of producing the reserves.\n\nGas reserves are assessed against existing contractual arrangements and local market conditions, as appropriate. In the case of gas reserves where contracts are not in place, a forward price scenario based on monetisation of the reserves through domestic markets has been used, including power generation opportunities, direct sales to LNG and other end users, and utilisation of Origin's wholesale and retail channels to market.\n\nFor CSG reserves that are intended to supply the APLNG CSG to LNG project, the economic test is based on a weighted average price across domestic, spot and LNG contracts, less short run marginal costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## e. Rounding\n\nInformation on reserves is quoted in this report rounded to the nearest whole number. Some totals in tables in this report may not add due to rounding. Items that round to zero are represented by the number 0, while items that are actually zero are represented with a dash \"-\".\n\n## f. Abbreviations\n\n| bbl     | barrel                            |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tscf    | trillion standard cubic feet      |\n| CSG     | coal seam gas                     |\n| kbbls   | kilo barrels = 1,000 barrels      |\n| ktonnes | kilo tonnes = 1,000 tonnes        |\n| mmboe   | million barrels of oil equivalent |\n| PJ      | petajoule = 1 x 10 15  joules     |\n| PJe     | petajoule equivalent              |\n\n## g. Conversion factors for PJe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCSG\n\n1.038 PJ/Bscf\n\n## h. Reference point\n\nReference points for Origin's petroleum reserves and contingent resources are defined points within Origin's operations where normal exploration and production business ceases, and quantities of the produced product are measured under defined conditions prior to custody transfer. Fuel, flare and vent consumed to the reference points are excluded.\n\n## i. Preparing and aggregating petroleum resources\n\nPetroleum reserves and contingent resources are typically prepared by deterministic methods with support from probabilistic methods. Petroleum reserves and contingent resources are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category and as a result, proved reserves may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of the arithmetic summation. Proved plus probable plus possible may be an optimistic estimate due to the same aforementioned reasons.\n\n## j. Methodology and internal controls\n\nThe reserves estimates undergo an assurance process to ensure that they are technically reasonable given the available data and have been prepared according to our reserves and resources process, which includes adherence to the PRMS Guidelines. The assurance process includes peer reviews of the technical and commercial assumptions. The annual reserves report is reviewed by management with the appropriate technical expertise, including the Resource Assessment Lead and Integrated Gas General Managers.\n\nfor downstream transport and processing. This price is exposed to changes in the supply/demand balance in the market through oil price-linked LNG contracts.\n\n## c. Reversionary rights\n\nThe CSG interests that APLNG acquired from Tri-Star in 2002 are subject to reversionary rights. If triggered, these rights will require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45 per cent interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. Origin has assessed the potential impact of these reversionary rights, based on economic tests consistent with the reserves and resources referable to the CSG interests, and based on that assessment does not consider that the existence of these reversionary rights impacts the reserves and resources quoted in this report. Tri-Star has commenced proceedings against APLNG claiming that reversion has occurred. APLNG denies that reversion has occurred and is defending the claim. 2\n\n## d. Information regarding the preparation of this Reserves Report\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or by Origin. All assessments are based on technical, commercial and operational data provided by Origin on behalf of APLNG.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources as at 30 June 2022 for APLNG's interests in non-operated assets are based on information in the NSAI report dated 29 July 2022. The data has been compiled by Mr John Hattner, a fulltime employee of NSAI. Mr Hattner has consented to the statements based on this information, and to the form and context in which these statements appear.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources for other assets are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of qualified petroleum reserves and resource evaluators who are employees of Origin.\n\nThis Reserves Statement as a whole has been approved by Ms Petrina Weatherstone CPEng NER MIEAust who is a full-time employee of Origin. Ms Petrina Weatherstone is Chief Reservoir Engineer, a qualified petroleum reserves and resources evaluator and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, has consented to the form and context in which these statements appear.",

Statutory financial measures also include measures that have been directly calculated from, or disaggregated directly from financial information included in the Financial Statements for the Origin Consolidated Group.\n\n| Term                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash flows from  investing activities    | Statutory cash flows from investing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows from  operating activities    | Statutory cash flows from operating activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows used in  financing activities | Statutory cash flows used in financing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                |\n| Net Debt                                 | Total current and non-current interest-bearing  liabilities only, less cash and cash equivalents  excluding cash to fund APLNG day-to- day operations.          |\n| Non- controlling interest                | Economic interest in a controlled entity of  the consolidated entity that is not held by  the Parent entity or a controlled entity of the  consolidated entity. |\n| Statutory  Profit/Loss                   | Net profit/loss after tax and non-controlling  interests as disclosed in the Income Statement  in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                 |\n| Statutory earnings  per share            | Statutory Profit/Loss divided by weighted  average number of shares as disclosed in the  Income Statement in the Origin Consolidated  Financial Statements.     |\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nNon-IFRS financial measures are defined as financial measures that are presented other than in accordance with all relevant Accounting Standards. Non-IFRS financial measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin's business, and to make decisions on allocation of resources. The Non-IFRS financial measures have been derived from Statutory financial measures included in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements, and are provided in this report, along with the Statutory financial measures to enable further insight and a different perspective into the financial performance, including profit and loss and cash flow outcomes, of the Origin business.\n\nThe principal Non-IFRS profit and loss measure of Underlying Profit has been reconciled to Statutory Profit in Section . The key Non-IFRS financial measures included in this report are defined below.\n\n| Term                                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| AASB                                         | Australian Accounting Standards Board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Adjusted  Net Debt                           | Net Debt adjusted to remove fair value adjustments  on hedged borrowings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Adjusted  Underlying  EBITDA                 | Origin Underlying EBITDA - Share of APLNG  Underlying EBITDA + net cash from APLNG over the  relevant 12 month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Average  interest rate                       | Interest expense divided by Origin's average drawn  debt during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| cps                                          | Cents per share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                              | Twelve months ended 30 June 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| FY22  (Current period)                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| FY21  (Prior period)                         | Twelve months ended 30 June 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Gearing                                      | Adjusted Net Debt / (Adjusted Net Debt +  Total equity)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Gross Profit Items excluded  from Underlying | Revenue less cost of goods sold.

A reference to Octopus Energy or Octopus is a reference to Octopus Energy Group Limited in which Origin holds an 18.7% shareholding as at 30 June 2022, with subsequent investment to restore its 20% shareholding in FY2023. Origin's shareholding in APLNG and Octopus Energy is equity accounted.\n\nA reference to $ is a reference to Australian dollars unless specifically marked otherwise.\n\nAll references to debt are a reference to interest bearing debt only.\n\nIndividual items and totals are rounded to the nearest appropriate number or decimal. Some totals may not add due to rounding of individual components.\n\nWhen calculating a percentage change, a positive or negative percentage change denotes the mathematical movement in the underlying metric, rather than a positive or a detrimental impact. Percentage changes on measures for which the numbers change from negative to positive, or vice versa, are labelled as not applicable.",
