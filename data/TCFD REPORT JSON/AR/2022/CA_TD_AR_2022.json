Earnings grew to $17.4 billion ($15.4 billion on an adjusted basis), a 22 per cent increase over 2021 (/f.shortive per cent on an adjusted basis), as we welcomed new customers and deepened existing relationships across our businesses. Our strong performance allowed us to invest in our business and our people, and we ended the year with a solid capital position resulting in a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 16.2 per cent.\n\nWe also announced two strategic transactions to add scale, new capabilities, talented colleagues, and over one million customers and clients to TD. Both the First Horizon and Cowen acquisitions are strategically compelling, /f.shortinancially attractive, within our risk appetite, and culturally aligned. These two organizations also share our deep commitment to the communities in which we live and work.\n\nAs we strengthened our business and invested in the future, we were pleased that our dividend increased by 13 per cent in 2022. We also declared a $0.07 dividend increase effective in the /f.shortirst quarter of /f.shortiscal 2023.\n\nThese results demonstrate the value creation inherent in our business model, and the continued success of our strategy.\n\n## Adapting to a changing landscape\n\n2022 was a year of /f.shortluctuating market dynamics. The disruption of the pandemic transformed entire industries. Powered by new technology, millions shifted how and where they work, spend, and invest. Unprecedented central bank monetary policy actions to address global in/f.shortlation, rapidly changing economic conditions, a devastating war in Ukraine, and new geopolitical dynamics further impacted the macroeconomic environment.\n\nOur investments in technology, products, people, and new capabilities enabled us to meet the needs of our customers and clients through a period of rapid change. With enhanced products, data-driven personalization, and trusted advice, we helped those we serve advance their /f.shortinancial goals.\n\n## Well-positioned businesses focused on customer and client needs\n\nAt TD, we are building our future for - and with - our customers and clients. Our success this year was supported by a consistent focus on their evolving needs.\n\nThe Canadian Personal Bank welcomed new customers, deepened relationships with innovative products and services, and further strengthened its position as Canada's leading personal bank. The Business Bank grew by supporting the aspirations of its customers and increasing its loan and deposit volumes. Wealth Management held its leadership position as Canada's largest direct investing business and institutional money manager. And TD Insurance introduced new products, increased the number of TD Auto Centres, and solidi/f.shortied its leadership as Canada's largest direct-to-consumer home and auto insurer.\n\nIn the United States, TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank, continued to grow with new stores, additional capabilities, and enhanced products. In just under twenty years, we have built a leading U.S. franchise that now serves nearly ten million customers from Maine to Florida. Once completed, the First Horizon acquisition will provide us with presence and scale in highly attractive, rapidly growing markets in the U.S. Southeast.\n\nIn Wholesale, TD Securities advanced its U.S. dollar strategy, strengthened its global business, and supported clients through a changing economic landscape. Upon closing, Cowen will help accelerate TD Securities' growth strategy and provide our clients with complementary capabilities and broader equity research coverage.\n\nOverall, 2022 was a year of tremendous progress. We brought more of the Bank to those we serve and strengthened our competitive position.\n\n## Continued investment in TD colleagues\n\nAs we built our business and advanced our strategy, we also invested in our colleagues - our greatest asset.\n\nIn 2022, we provided most TD bankers with a one-time salary increase or bonus, in addition to their annual compensation adjustments, as a recognition of their extraordinary efforts. We also continued to deliver training and development programs to equip our people with capabilities to help them grow professionally. In fact, nearly 80 per cent of our colleagues took advantage of the TD Thrive digital platform to complement Bank training programs with self-directed learning.\n\nWe also advanced our diversity and inclusion priorities. We reached our goal of doubling the number of Black executives by the end of 2022 and made strides on our objectives to further increase minority and women executive representation. Our overall progress earned TD recognition as a leading diversity employer, including being named one of Canada's Best Workplaces for Women by Great Place to Work Canada, and a Top Company for Diversity by DiversityInc in the U.S.",

Through sustainable /f.shortinance products, new services, advice, and guidance, we also worked with clients to help create and /f.shortinance their transition strategies.\n\nAs a result of this work, we are proud to be the only Canadian bank listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for eight consecutive years.\n\nA sustainable future also requires continued investment in new ideas and innovative solutions. The 2022 TD Ready Challenge, our annual initiative to address important societal issues, is allocating ten grants of $1 million each to organizations developing new solutions to support the needs of those disproportionately affected by climate change.\n\n'  At TD, we are building our future for - and with - our customers and clients. Our success this year was supported by a consistent focus on their evolving needs.'\n\nWe also dedicated human capital and /f.shortinancial resources to help create a more inclusive future. In 2022 alone, TD contributed more than $147 million towards our 2030 target of $1 billion to community, non-pro/f.shortit, and other organizations through the TD Ready Commitment. These investments directly contribute to a better tomorrow across our communities, where all have the opportunity to thrive.\n\n## Con/f.shortidence in the future\n\nI am proud of our performance and progress in 2022. We enter 2023 in a strong /f.shortinancial position with a leading global brand, well-positioned businesses, more than 27 million customers, and the best talent in the industry.\n\nWe expect the economic landscape to evolve over the coming year, creating /f.shortinancial complexity for millions of households and businesses. Those we serve will need our expertise and our advice more than ever.\n\nTD will be there for our customers and clients, for our communities, and for the economies we support. We will invest in new capabilities, products, and services to further strengthen our business. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering on our purpose: to enrich the lives of our customers, communities, and colleagues. That's what it means to Be the Better Bank.\n\nI would like to thank our TD colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts, our customers and clients for their trust, and you, our shareholders, for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBharat Masrani\n\nGroup President and Chief Executive Of/f.shorticer",

In addition, representatives of the/uni00A0Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management's Discussion and Analysis ('2022 MD&A') in the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Annual Report under the heading 'Economic Summary and Outlook', under the headings 'Key Priorities for 2023' and 'Operating Environment and Outlook' for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading '2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023' for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the/uni00A0Bank's objectives and priorities for 2023 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the/uni00A0Bank operates, and the/uni00A0Bank's anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as 'will', 'would', 'should', 'believe', 'expect', 'anticipate', 'intend', 'estimate', 'plan', 'goal', 'target', 'may', and 'could'.\n\nBy their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the/uni00A0Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond the/uni00A0Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict - may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the/uni00A0Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and recession; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability of the/uni00A0Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the/uni00A0Bank's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the/uni00A0Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the/uni00A0Bank's use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the/uni00A0Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the/uni00A0Bank's credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the/uni00A0Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the/uni00A0Bank's results. For more detailed information, please refer to the 'Risk Factors and Management' section of the 2022 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading 'Significant Acquisitions' or 'Significant Events and Pending Acquisitions' in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com. All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the/uni00A0Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the/uni00A0Bank's forward-looking statements.\n\nMaterial economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2022 MD&A under the heading 'Economic Summary and Outlook', under the headings 'Key Priorities for 2023' and 'Operating Environment and Outlook' for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading '2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023' for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the/uni00A0Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the/uni00A0Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forwardlooking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation.",

('Cowen') announced a definitive agreement for TD to acquire Cowen in an all-cash transaction valued at US$1.3/uni00A0billion, or US$39.00 for each share of Cowen common stock. The Bank is currently planning to close the transaction in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from certain U.S., Canadian, and foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory approvals are not within the/uni00A0Bank's control. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank from the closing date and reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the/uni00A0Bank and Cowen, including transaction-related impacts, the/uni00A0Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the Cowen acquisition, pro forma for the closing of the/uni00A0Bank's acquisition of First Horizon Corporation ('First Horizon').\n\n## Sale of Schwab Common Shares\n\nOn August 1, 2022, in order to provide the capital required for the acquisition of Cowen, the/uni00A0Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation ('Schwab') at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion). Approximately 15 million shares were sold to Schwab pursuant to a repurchase agreement at a price equal to the price obtained in the sale of 13.4 million shares sold to a broker dealer pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 . All shares sold automatically converted into shares of Schwab voting common stock and the shares acquired by Schwab are no longer outstanding. The sales reduced the/uni00A0Bank's ownership interest in Schwab from approximately 13.4% to 12.0%. The Bank recognized $997 million as other income (net of $368 million loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank and First Horizon announced a definitive agreement for the/uni00A0Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all-cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the/uni00A0Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible\n\n## FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW\n\n## CORPORATE OVERVIEW\n\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group ('TD' or the 'Bank'). TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD/uni00A0Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank \u00ae , TD Auto Finance U.S., TD/uni00A0Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD/uni00A0Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking. TD also ranks among the world's leading online financial services firms, with more than 15/uni00A0million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.9 trillion in assets on October 31, 2022. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol 'TD' on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges.\n\nin/uni00A0certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon's common stock). The Bank is currently planning to close the transaction in the first half of fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. Regulatory approvals are not within the/uni00A0Bank's control. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank from the closing date and reported in the U.S./uni00A0Retail segment.\n\nFirst Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65 per share on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed by February 27, 2023 (the 'outside date'), subject to the right of either party (under certain conditions) to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023. During the year, the/uni00A0Bank implemented a strategy to mitigate interest\n\nrate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition.\n\nThe fair value of First Horizon's fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the/uni00A0Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.\n\nAfter the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments' basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank reported $1,487 million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $154 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the year ended October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0reported $121 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps since the de-designation of the hedge accounting relationships.\n\n## ECONOMIC SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nThe outlook for the global economy for the next two years was downgraded relative to the prior quarter. In Europe, an energy crisis continues to impact household finances and weigh on industrial output. China is reckoning with the fallout of its real estate slowdown and strict COVID-19 controls. In North America, COVID-19 is causing fewer supply chain disruptions, but the legacy of high domestic inflation and tight labour markets has led to central banks raising policy rates at the fastest pace in roughly four decades. This has significantly weakened the economic growth prospects over the next twelve to twenty-four months.\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded by 2.6% annualized in the third calendar quarter of 2022, after having contracted in the first half of the year. However, this was largely due to a surge in exports relative to imports. In contrast, domestic demand grew by a soft 0.5%. Consumer spending growth decelerated to 1.4% relative to the prior calendar quarter of 2.0%, as inflation continued to weigh on the purchasing power of households, which are also normalizing spending away from goods after a surge during the pandemic. The ongoing downturn in housing also weighed on the economy in the third calendar quarter, subtracting 1.4 percentage points from growth.",

        "page_content": "As the lagged effect of interest rate increases is expected to continue to feed through the economy in 2023, it should lead to some cooling in the job market, where the unemployment rate was 3.7% in October, near a cyclical low. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has shown modest signs of cooling, but at 7.7% year-over-year in October, it is still close to 40-year highs. Slower global growth and a high U.S. dollar are expected to help goods inflation ease, while services inflation is likely to prove more/uni00A0persistent.\n\nThe Federal Reserve continued its aggressive pace of rate increases, with a fourth 75 basis points (bps) hike in early November. TD Economics expects further interest rate hikes will take the Federal Funds rate to a range of 4.50-5.00% in calendar 2023. This historically large increase in interest rates raises the risk that the economy will slow more quickly and trigger an outright recession. Financial markets have reflected this risk with the yield curve inverting.\n\nThe Canadian economy has begun to slow after growing at a very healthy pace in the first half of the year. The interest-rate sensitive housing market was the first area of the economy to respond to the/uni00A0Bank of Canada's rapid increase in the policy rate. As of October, home sales were down 40% from the peak in February of this year. Housing demand is expected to cool further as higher interest rates continue to weigh on affordability. Canadian inflation has begun to decelerate but remained high at 6.9% year-over-year in October. The labour market has also remained quite strong through October, although TD Economics expects job market conditions to ease in the coming quarters, in line with weaker demand in the broader economy.\n\nThe Bank of Canada raised its overnight interest rate by 50 bps in October, to 3.75%.TD Economics expects further increases in the overnight rate to a range of 4.25-4.50% in calendar 2023. With interest rates expected to increase to a lesser degree in Canada than in the United States, the Canadian dollar may reach a low of 70 U.S. cents in the first half of calendar 2023.\n\n## HOW THE BANK REPORTS\n\nThe Bank prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, the current GAAP, and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as 'reported' results.\n\n## Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to reported results, the/uni00A0Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, nonGAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as 'adjusted' results, are utilized to assess the/uni00A0Bank's businesses and to measure the/uni00A0Bank's overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the/uni00A0Bank adjusts for 'items of note', from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings\n\n## T A B L E 2 | OPERATING RESULTS - Reported\n\nper share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the/uni00A0Bank's performance. NonGAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the/uni00A0Bank's financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the/uni00A0Bank's capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear.\n\n## U.S. Strategic Cards\n\nThe Bank's U.S. strategic cards portfolio comprises agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co-branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the/uni00A0Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and provisions for credit losses (PCL) related to these portfolios in the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners' share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners' net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate's reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements./uni00A0\n\n## Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation\n\nOn October 6, 2020, the/uni00A0Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in Schwab following the completion of Schwab's acquisition of TD/uni00A0Ameritrade Holding Corporation ('TD/uni00A0Ameritrade') of which the/uni00A0Bank was a major shareholder (the 'Schwab transaction'). On August 1, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, which reduced the/uni00A0Bank's ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. For further details, refer to Note 12 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank's share of Schwab's earnings is reported with a onemonth lag, and the/uni00A0Bank started recording its share of Schwab's earnings on this basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the/uni00A0Bank's share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction.\n\nOn November 25, 2019, the/uni00A0Bank and Schwab entered into an insured deposit account agreement (the 'Schwab IDA Agreement'), which became effective upon closing of the Schwab transaction and has an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Refer to the 'Related Party Transactions' section of this document for further details.\n\nThe following table provides the operating results on a reported basis for the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                               | 2022     | 2021         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|\n| Net interest income                                                          | $ 27,353 | $ 24,131     |\n| Non-interest income                                                          | 21,679   | 18,562       |\n| Total revenue                                                                | 49,032   | 42,693       |\n| Provision for credit losses                                                  | 1,067    | (224)        |\n| Insurance claims and related expenses                                        | 2,900    | 2,707        |\n| Non-interest expenses                                                        | 24,641   | 23,076       |\n| Income before income taxes and share of net income from investment in Schwab | 20,424   | 17,134 3,621 |\n| Provision for (recovery of) income taxes                                     | 3,986    | 785          |\n| Share of net income from investment in Schwab                                | 991      |              |\n| Net income - reported                                                        | 17,429   | 14,298       |\n| Preferred dividends and distributions on other equity instruments            | 259      | 249          |\n| Net income available to common shareholders                                  | $ 17,170 | $ 14,049     |",

Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP ratio, and can be utilized in assessing the/uni00A0Bank's use of equity.\n\nROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank's methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments increased to 10.5% of risk weighted assets effective the first quarter of 2022 compared with 9% in fiscal 2021.\n\n| T A B L E                                              | RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY                                |          |          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)        | (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)        | 2022     | 2021     |\n| Average common equity                                  | Average common equity                                  | $ 95,326 | $ 90,677 |\n| Net income available to common shareholders - reported | Net income available to common shareholders - reported | 17,170   | 14,049   |\n| Items of note, net of income taxes                     | Items of note, net of income taxes                     | (2,004)  | 351      |\n| Net income available to common shareholders - adjusted | Net income available to common shareholders - adjusted | $ 15,166 | $ 14,400 |\n| Return on common equity - reported                     | Return on common equity - reported                     | 18.0%    | 15.5%    |\n| Return on common equity - adjusted                     | Return on common equity - adjusted                     | 15.9     | 15.9     |\n\n## RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY\n\nTangible common equity (TCE) is calculated as common shareholders' equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill and intangibles on the investments in Schwab and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities.

Adjusted revenue was $46,170 million, an increase of $3,477 million, or 8%, compared with last year.\n\n## NET INTEREST INCOME\n\nReported net interest income for the year was $27,353 million, an increase of $3,222 million, or 13%, compared with last year. The increase reflects volume and margin growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses, the impact of foreign exchange translation, and higher net interest income in Wholesale Banking, partially offset by lower income from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness. Adjusted net interest income was $27,307 million, an increase of $3,176 million, or/uni00A013%.\n\nBy segment, the increase in reported net interest income reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $1,530 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $1,201 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $307 million, an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $183 million, and an increase in the Corporate segment of/uni00A0$1/uni00A0million.\n\n## NET INTEREST MARGIN\n\nNet interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank's earning assets less the cost of funding. Net interest margin increased by 13 bps during the year to 1.69%, compared with 1.56% last year, primarily reflecting higher deposit margins given the rising rate environment. Average interest earning assets used in the calculation is a non-GAAP financial measure and net interest margin is a non-GAAP ratio. They are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.\n\n## NON-INTEREST INCOME\n\nReported non-interest income for the year was $21,679 million, an increase of $3,117 million, or 17%, compared with last year, primarily reflecting the net gain from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, and gain on sale of Schwab shares. Adjusted non-interest income was $18,863 million, an increase of $301/uni00A0million, or 2%, reflecting higher fee-based revenue in the banking\n\nand wealth businesses, and higher insurance revenues reflecting prior year premium rebates for customers, and volumes. These were partially offset by lower transaction fees in the wealth business, a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, markdowns in certain loan underwriting commitments from widening credit spreads in Wholesale Banking, and lower underwriting revenue.\n\nBy segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in the Corporate segment of $2,600 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $468 million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $137 million, and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $88 million, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $176 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| T A B L E                                            | NON-INTEREST INCOME                                  | NON-INTEREST INCOME   | NON-INTEREST INCOME   | NON-INTEREST INCOME   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)      | (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)      |                       | 2022 vs. 2021         | 2022 vs. 2021         |\n|                                                      |                                                      | 2022                  | 2021                  | % change              |\n| Investment and securities services                   | Investment and securities services                   |                       |                       |                       |\n| Broker dealer fees and commissions                   | Broker dealer fees and commissions                   | $  917                | $  1,095              | (16)                  |\n| Full-service brokerage and other securities services | Full-service brokerage and other securities services | 1,581                 | 1,453                 | 9                     |\n| Underwriting and advisory                            | Underwriting and advisory                            | 558                   | 816                   | (32)                  |\n| Investment management fees                           | Investment management fees                           | 651                   | 649                   | -                     |\n| Mutual fund management                               | Mutual fund management                               | 2,057                 | 2,052                 | -                     |\n| Trust fees                                           | Trust fees                                           | 105                   | 114                   | (8)                   |\n| Total investment and securities services             | Total investment and securities services             | 5,869                 | 6,179                 | (5)                   |\n| Credit fees                                          | Credit fees                                          | 1,615                 | 1,453                 | 11                    |\n| Trading income (losses)                              | Trading income (losses)                              | (257)                 | 313                   | (182)                 |\n| Service charges                                      | Service charges                                      | 2,871                 | 2,655                 | 8                     |\n| Card services                                        | Card services                                        | 2,890                 | 2,435                 | 19                    |\n| Insurance revenue                                    | Insurance revenue                                    | 5,380                 | 4,877                 | 10                    |\n| Other income (loss)                                  | Other income (loss)                                  | 3,311                 | 650                   | 409                   |\n| Total                                                | Total                                                | $ 21,679              | $ 18,562              | 17                    |",

Trading income (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading assets and liabilities. Net interest income on trading positions arises from interest and dividends related to trading assets and liabilities and is reported net of interest expense and income associated with funding these assets and liabilities in the following\n\nTrading-related revenue by product line depicts trading income for each major trading category.\n\ntable. Trading-related revenue excludes underwriting fees and commissions on securities transactions.

PCL/uni00A0-/uni00A0performing was a recovery of $370 million, compared with a recovery of $1,533/uni00A0million last year. The current year performing release/uni00A0reflects improved credit conditions. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.14%.\n\nBy segment, PCL was higher in U.S. Retail by $585 million, in the Corporate segment by $317 million, in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking by $235 million, and in Wholesale Banking by $155 million, and lower in Wealth Management and Insurance by $1 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $24,359 million, an increase of $1,450 million, or 6%.\n\nBy segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $528/uni00A0million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $503 million, an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $356 million, and an increase in/uni00A0Wholesale/uni00A0Banking of $324 million, partially offset by a decrease in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Corporate segment of $146 million.\n\n## INSURANCE CLAIMS AND RELATED EXPENSES\n\nInsurance claims and related expenses were $2,900 million, an increase of $193 million, or 7%, compared with last year, reflecting increased driving activity, inflationary costs and more severe weather-related events, partially offset by the impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a/uni00A0similar decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income and favourable prior years' claims development.\n\n## EFFICIENCY RATIO\n\nThe efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by dividing non-interest expenses by total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue.\n\nThe reported efficiency ratio was 50.3%, compared with 54.1% last year.

Adjusted total income and other taxes increased by $106/uni00A0million from last year, or 2.0%, reflecting an increase in other taxes of $169/uni00A0million, or 10.4%, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $63 million, or 1.7%.\n\nThe Bank's reported effective income tax rate was 19.5% for 2022, compared with 21.1% last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the favourable tax impact of earnings mix, the sale of Schwab shares, and the recognition of unused tax losses, partially offset by the impact of higher pre-tax income. For a reconciliation of the/uni00A0Bank's effective income tax rate with the Canadian statutory income tax rate, refer to Note/uni00A025 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Bank reported its investments in Schwab using the equity method of accounting. Schwab's tax expense (2022: $319 million; 2021: $280/uni00A0million) was not part of the/uni00A0Bank's effective tax rate.\n\nTo allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the applicable income tax rate of the relevant legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank's adjusted effective income tax rate for 2022 was 20.1%, compared with 21.1% last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the favourable tax impact of earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. Adjusted results are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.\n\n## T A B L E 1 2 | INCOME TAXES - Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Provision for income taxes - reported             | $ 3,986 | $ 3,621 |\n| Total adjustments for items of note               | (391)   | 37      |\n| Provision for income taxes - adjusted             | 3,595   | 3,658   |\n| Other taxes                                       |         |         |\n| Payroll                                           | 722     | 635     |\n| Capital and premium                               | 214     | 201     |\n| GST, HST, and provincial sales 1                  | 625     | 535     |\n| Municipal and business                            | 232     | 253     |\n| Total other taxes                                 | 1,793   | 1,624   |\n| Total taxes - adjusted                            | $ 5,388 | $ 5,282 |\n| Effective income tax rate - reported              | 19.5%   | 21.1%   |\n| Effective income tax rate - adjusted              | 20.1    | 21.1    |\n\n## Proposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget\n\nThe Canadian Federal budget presented on April 7, 2022, proposed to/uni00A0introduce a one-time tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to/uni00A0as/uni00A0the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD), and an additional permanent tax. On November 22, 2022, the legislation to implement the CRD and/uni00A0the/uni00A0additional permanent tax completed second reading in the House/uni00A0of Commons.\n\nThe legislation proposes the CRD to be a 15% tax on an average of 2020 and 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. If enacted as proposed, the legislation is expected to result in a CRD of approximately $800 million over the period.\n\nThe additional permanent tax is proposed to be 1.5% of taxable income above $100 million. It would be prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, and will result in revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIt is possible that the impact of the legislation may differ from the/uni00A0Bank's current estimate due to, among other things, changes in elective deductions available to the/uni00A0Bank at the time the tax returns are/uni00A0filed as well as adjustments to our filing positions arising on audit.",

On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $4,065/uni00A0million, an increase of $199 million, or 5%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, reflecting higher revenues and favourable tax impact of earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses, partially offset by higher PCL, non-interest expenses and insurance claims. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.62, an increase of 77%, compared with $2.04 in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.18, an increase of 4%, compared with $2.09 in/uni00A0the fourth/uni00A0quarter of last year.\n\nReported revenue for the quarter was $15,563 million, an increase of $4,622 million, or 42%, compared with the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $12,247 million, an increase of $1,306 million, or 12%, compared with the fourth quarter last year.\n\nReported net interest income for the quarter was $7,630 million, an increase of $1,368 million, or 22%, primarily reflecting margin and volume growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. By segment, the increase in reported net interest income reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $854 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $525 million, and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $73 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $78 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $6 million. Adjusted net interest income for the quarter was $7,627 million, an increase of $1,365 million, or 22%, compared with the fourth quarter last year.\n\nReported non-interest income for the quarter was $7,933 million, an increase of $3,254 million, or 70%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, primarily reflecting the net gain from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition and gain on sale of Schwab shares. Adjusted non-interest income was $4,620/uni00A0million, a decrease of $59 million, or 1%, reflecting lower fee-based and transaction revenue in the wealth business, and markdowns in certain loan underwriting commitments from widening credit spreads in Wholesale Banking, partially offset by higher wholesale trading revenues. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in the Corporate segment of $3,311 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $75 million, and an increase in Wholesale Banking of $15 million, partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Insurance of $108 million and a decrease in U.S. Retail of $39 million.\n\nPCL for the quarter was $617 million, compared with a recovery of $123 million in the fourth quarter last year. PCL - impaired was $454/uni00A0million, an increase of $234/uni00A0million, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL - performing was $163/uni00A0million, compared with a recovery of $343 million in the fourth quarter last year. The performing build this quarter reflects some normalization of credit performance, deterioration in the economic outlook, and volume growth. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.29%.\n\nBy segment, PCL was higher by $301/uni00A0million in U.S. Retail, by $176/uni00A0million in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, by $160/uni00A0million in the Corporate segment and by $103/uni00A0million in Wholesale Banking.\n\nInsurance claims and related expenses were $723 million, an increase of $73 million, or 11%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, reflecting increased driving activity, inflationary costs and more severe weather-related events, partially offset by favourable prior years' claims development and the impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income.\n\nReported non-interest expenses for the quarter were $6,545 million, an increase of $598 million, or 10%, compared with the fourth quarter last year reflecting higher employee-related expenses, the impact of foreign exchange translation, and higher spend supporting business growth, partially offset by corporate real estate optimization costs in the prior year. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $359 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $201 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $144 million, and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $16 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $122 million. Adjusted non-interest expenses for the quarter were $6,430 million, an increase of $532 million, or 9%, compared with the fourth quarter last year.\n\nThe Bank's reported effective tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter, compared with 20.4% in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the favourable tax impact of earnings mix, the sale of Schwab shares, and the recognition of unused tax losses, partially offset by the impact of lower favourable tax adjustments and higher pretax income.\n\nThe Bank's adjusted effective tax rate was 16.7% for the quarter, compared with 20.4% in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the favourable tax impact of earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses, partially offset by the impact of lower favourable tax adjustments.\n\n## QUARTERLY TREND ANALYSIS\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on TD's financial performance in 2022. As the year progressed, the/uni00A0Bank's personal and commercial banking businesses benefited from higher deposit margins reflecting a rising rate environment, volume growth and a rebound in customer activity, while the/uni00A0Bank's market-related businesses experienced a slowdown relative to elevated activity in the prior year. Credit conditions remained stable in the first half of the year before experiencing some normalization in the second half of the year, reflecting a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook which resulted in higher PCLs. Expenses were higher, reflecting employee-related expenses including variable compensation and investments in support of business growth. The Bank's quarterly earnings were impacted by, among other things, seasonality, the number of days in a quarter, the economic environment in Canada and the U.S., and foreign currency translation.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS\n\n## Business Focus\n\nFor management reporting purposes, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank's other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. The comparative period information has been adjusted to reflect the new segment alignment.\n\nCanadian Personal and Commercial Banking serves approximately 15/uni00A0million customers in Canadian personal and business banking. Personal Banking provides a comprehensive suite of deposit, payment and lending products and advice through a network of 1,060 branches, 3,401 automated teller machines (ATM), mobile specialized salesforce, and/uni00A0telephone, mobile and internet banking services. Business Banking offers a broad range of customized products and services to help business owners meet their financing, investment, cash management, international trade, and day-to-day banking needs. Auto Finance provides flexible financing options to customers at point of sale for automotive and recreational vehicle purchases. Merchant Solutions provides point-of-sale payment solutions for large and small businesses.\n\nU.S. Retail includes the/uni00A0Bank's personal, business banking and wealth management operations in the U.S., as well as the/uni00A0Bank's investment in Schwab. Operating under the TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank \u00ae brand, the U.S. Retail Bank serves 9.9 million customers in stores from Maine to Florida, and via auto dealerships and credit card partner business locations nationwide. Personal Banking provides a full range of financial products and services to customers mainly from Maine to Florida through a network of 1,160 stores, 2,693 ATMs, telephone, and mobile and internet banking services. Business Banking offers a diversified range of products and services to help businesses meet their financing, investment, cash management, international trade, and day-to-day banking needs. Wealth management provides wealth products and services to retail and institutional clients. The contribution from the/uni00A0Bank's investment in Schwab is reported as equity in net income of an investment in Schwab with a one-month lag.\n\nWealth Management and Insurance serves approximately 6 million customers across the wealth and insurance businesses in Canada. Wealth Management offers wealth and asset management products and advice to retail and institutional clients in Canada through the direct investing, advice-based, and asset management businesses. Insurance offers property and casualty insurance through direct response channels and to members of affinity groups, as well as life and health insurance products to customers across Canada.\n\nWholesale Banking serves over 12,000 corporate, government, and institutional clients in key financial markets around the world. Operating under the TD Securities brand, Wholesale Banking offers capital markets and corporate and investment banking services to external clients and provides market access and wholesale banking solutions for the/uni00A0Bank's wealth and retail operations and their customers. Wholesale Banking's expertise is global, supported by a presence across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe Bank's other business activities are grouped in the Corporate segment and consist of service and control groups, including technology solutions, shared services, treasury and balance sheet management, marketing, human resources, finance, risk management, compliance, legal, and antimoney laundering, among others. Certain costs relating to/uni00A0these functions are allocated to operating business segments. The basis of allocation and methodologies are reviewed periodically to align with management's evaluation of the/uni00A0Bank's business segments.\n\nResults of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the/uni00A0Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments the/uni00A0Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to Note/uni00A029/uni00A0of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNet interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a TEB, which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the/uni00A0Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the year was $149/uni00A0million (October 31, 2021 - $152 million).\n\nShare of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S./uni00A0Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.\n\nThe 'Key Priorities for 2023' section for each business segment, provided on the following pages, is based on the/uni00A0Bank's views and the assumptions set out in the 'Economic Summary and Outlook' section and the actual outcome may be materially different. For more information, refer to the 'Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' section and/uni00A0the 'Risk Factors That May/uni00A0Affect Future Results' section.",

ROE for the year was 42.3%, compared with/uni00A044.7% last year.\n\nRevenue for the year was $16,586 million, an increase of $1,669/uni00A0million, or 11%, compared with last year.\n\nNet interest income increased $1,201 million, or 11%, reflecting volume growth and higher margins. Average loan volumes increased $42/uni00A0billion, or 9%, reflecting 8% growth in personal loans and 15% growth in business loans. Average deposit volumes increased $28 billion, or 7%, reflecting 8% growth in personal deposits and 6% growth in business deposits. Net interest margin was 2.56%, an increase of 4 bps from same period last year, primarily due to higher margins on deposits reflecting rising interest rates, partially offset by lower margins on loans, lower mortgage prepayment revenue, and changes in balance sheet mix.\n\nNon-interest income increased $468 million, or 13%, reflecting increased client activity, including foreign exchange and credit card-related revenue.\n\nPCL was $491 million, an increase of $235 million, compared with last year. PCL - impaired was $639 million, a decrease of $11 million, or/uni00A02%. PCL -/uni00A0performing was a recovery of $148 million, compared with a recovery of $394 million in the prior year. The current year performing release reflects improved credit conditions. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.10%, an increase of 4 bps.\n\nNon-interest expenses for the year were $7,176 million, an increase of $528 million, or 8%, compared with last year. The increase primarily reflects higher spend supporting business growth, including technology and employee-related expenses.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the year was 43.3%, compared with 44.6% last year.\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK\n\nAfter registering a strong recovery over the past 12-18 months, economic activity in Canada is expected to moderate in fiscal 2023 with a risk of recession. While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, revenue growth in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking is expected to continue to reflect the interest rate environment and its corresponding impact on consumer and business activities. While housing markets are expected to continue to adjust, an increase in customer activity, customer growth, and the impact of recent interest rate increases should support continued revenue growth in the next year. PCL is expected to increase over the course of the year, reflecting an ongoing normalization of credit conditions and volume growth. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking will maintain its disciplined approach to expense management, investing in distribution capability, technology, infrastructure, and colleagues to anticipate changing customer expectations, with a focus on driving the future of banking. While the quarterly trend in earnings may be uneven, TD's digitally enabled Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking franchise should be wellpositioned to execute on its customer centric strategy.",

Non-traditional competitors have gained momentum and are increasingly collaborating with banks to develop new products and services and enhance the customer experience. The keys to profitability continue to be attracting and retaining customer relationships with legendary service and convenience, offering products and services across multiple distribution channels to meet customers' evolving needs, investing strategically while maintaining expense discipline, and managing risk prudently.",

U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income was $4,449 million (US$3,451 million), an increase of $362 million (US$195/uni00A0million), or 9% (6% in U.S. dollars), reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher PCL and non-interest expenses.\n\nU.S. Retail Bank revenue is derived from personal and business banking, and wealth management businesses. Reported revenue for the year was US$9,632/uni00A0million, an increase of US$1,078 million, or 13%, compared with last year. On an adjusted basis, revenue increased US$901/uni00A0million, or 11%. Net interest income of US$7,437 million, increased US$1,018/uni00A0million, or 16%, driven by the benefit of higher deposit margins from the rising rate environment, higher business and personal deposit and loan volumes, and increased earnings on the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness and lower margin on loans. Net interest margin was 2.54%, an increase of 35 bps, as higher margin on deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment was partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness and lower margin on loans. Reported non-interest income was US$2,195/uni00A0million, an increase of US$60/uni00A0million, or 3%, compared with last year, reflecting an insurance recovery related to litigation and fee income growth from increased customer activity, partially offset by lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans this year and higher valuation of certain investments last year. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income decreased US$117 million, or 5%, reflecting lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans this year and higher valuation of certain investments last year, partially offset by fee income growth from increased customer activity.\n\nAverage loan volumes decreased US$3 billion, or 2%, compared with last year. Business loans decreased 7%, reflecting paydowns on commercial loans and PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by strong originations, new customer growth, higher commercial line utilization and increased customer activity. Excluding PPP loans, business loans were largely flat. Personal loans increased 5%, reflecting higher residential mortgage and auto originations coupled with lower prepayments, and higher credit card volumes. Average deposit volumes increased US$10/uni00A0billion, or 3%, compared with last year, reflecting a 10% and a/uni00A05%/uni00A0increase in personal and business deposit volumes, respectively, and/uni00A0a/uni00A05% decrease in sweep deposits volumes.\n\nAssets under administration (AUA) were US$34 billion as at October/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, an increase of US$4 billion, or 13%, compared with last year, reflecting net asset growth. Assets under management (AUM) were US$33 billion as at October 31, 2022, a decrease of US$8 billion, or/uni00A020%, reflecting market depreciation and net asset outflows.\n\nPCL for the year was US$254 million compared with a recovery of US$206 million last year. PCL - impaired was US$404 million, an increase of US$60 million, or 17%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL - performing was a recovery of US$150 million, compared with a recovery of US$550 million in the prior year. The current year performing release reflects continued but smaller improvements in credit conditions. U.S. Retail PCL including only the/uni00A0Bank's share of PCL in the U.S. strategic cards portfolio, as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.16%, or an increase of 28 bps.\n\nReported non-interest expenses for the year were US$5,364 million, an increase of US$263 million, or 5%, compared with last year, reflecting higher employee-related expenses, acquisition and integration-related charges for the First Horizon acquisition and higher investments in the business, partially offset by a US$125/uni00A0million in prior year store optimization costs and productivity savings in the current year. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition and integration-related charges for the First Horizon acquisition, non-interest expenses increased US$191/uni00A0million, or 4%.\n\nThe reported and adjusted efficiency ratios for the year were 55.7% and 56.0%, compared with 59.6% last year.\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK\n\nThe outlook for U.S. Retail reflects an elevated risk of a recession, including continued high inflation, labour shortages, global supply chain disruptions impacting industries, and rising interest rates, with uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of possible interest rate declines. Revenue growth from higher personal and commercial deposit and loan volumes, the benefits of a rising rate environment on deposit margins, increased customer activity and new customer growth, is expected to be moderated by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness, the impact of the overdraft policy changes, repatriation of sweep deposits, and a more competitive customer deposit rate environment. PCL is expected to increase over the course of the year, reflecting an ongoing normalization of credit conditions and volume growth. U.S. Retail will maintain its disciplined approach to expense management, while continuing to invest strategically to support business growth and generate productivity savings. While earnings are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, the U.S. Retail Bank should be well-positioned to continue to grow while strengthening our service and convenience leadership model, enhancing our product and advice offerings while relentlessly delivering end-to-end, differentiated customer/uni00A0experiences.\n\n## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nRefer to Note 12 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Schwab.",

The ROE for the year was 46.7%, compared with 58.1% last year.\n\nRevenue for the year was $10,860 million, an increase of $271 million, or 3%, compared with last year. Non-interest income was $9,915 million, an increase of $88 million, or 1%, reflecting higher insurance volumes and prior year premium rebates for customers, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, and lower fee-based and transaction revenue in the wealth management business. Net interest income was $945 million, an increase of $183 million, or 24%, compared with last year, reflecting volume growth and higher margins.\n\nAUA were $517 billion as at October 31, 2022, a decrease of $40/uni00A0billion, or 7%, and AUM were $397 billion as at October 31, 2022, a decrease of $30/uni00A0billion, or 7%, compared with last year, both reflecting market depreciation, partially offset by net asset growth.\n\nInsurance claims and related expenses were $2,900 million, an increase of $193 million, or 7%, compared with last year, reflecting increased driving activity, inflationary costs and more severe weather-related events, partially offset by the impact of a higher discount rate which resulted\n\nin a/uni00A0similar decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income and favourable prior years' claims development.\n\nNon-interest expenses for the year were $4,711 million, an increase of $356 million, or 8%, compared with last year. The increase reflects higher spend supporting business growth, including technology and marketing costs, higher employee-related expenses and variable compensation.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the year was 43.4%, compared with 41.1% last/uni00A0year.\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK\n\nWhile the Canadian economy has had a strong recovery, it is expected that economic activity will slow in 2023. Continued inflationary pressures, economic uncertainty and market volatility may impact Wealth Management and Insurance results in fiscal 2023. Notwithstanding these headwinds, Wealth Management and Insurance's diversified businesses should be well-positioned to deliver against their strategic objectives. The interest rate environment is expected to help offset headwinds from normalized direct investing trading volumes, market volatility, pressure on fees from rising competition, and increases in insurance claims as customer activity normalizes. Our businesses will continue to deliver high-quality advice, educational content and innovative financial products to our customers to help navigate the challenging environment.",

PCL - performing was $18 million, compared with a recovery of/uni00A0$126 million in the prior year.\n\nReported non-interest expenses were $3,033 million, an increase of $324 million, or 12%, compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting the continued investments in Wholesale Banking's U.S. dollar strategy, including the hiring of banking, sales and trading, and technology professionals, the acquisition of TD Securities Automated Trading (previously Headlands Tech Global Markets, LLC), acquisition and integration-related charges primarily for the Cowen acquisition, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $3,015 million, an increase of $306 million, or 11%.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS\n\n## Corporate\n\nCorporate segment is comprised of a number of service and control groups.

The year-overyear increase primarily reflects a net gain from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, gain on sale of Schwab shares, and lower net corporate expenses, partially offset by a lower contribution from other items in the current year. Net corporate expenses decreased $27 million compared to the prior year, largely reflecting corporate real estate optimization costs in the prior year. Other items decreased $31 million, reflecting lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, partially offset by the favourable tax impact of earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. The adjusted net loss for the year was $391/uni00A0million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $387 million last year.\n\n## 2022 ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FOCUS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, the Corporate segment continued to support the/uni00A0Bank's business segments by executing on enterprise and regulatory initiatives, and managing the/uni00A0Bank's balance sheet and funding activities.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, the Corporate segment's service and control groups will continue to proactively address the complexities and challenges arising from the operating environment to respond to changing demands and expectations of customers, communities, colleagues, governments and/uni00A0regulators.\n- \u00b7 Corporate segment will also maintain its focus on development and/uni00A0implementation of processes, systems, technologies, enterprise/uni00A0and/uni00A0regulatory controls to enable the/uni00A0Bank's businesses to/uni00A0operate efficiently and effectively and in compliance with applicable/uni00A0regulatory requirements.\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK\n\nLooking ahead, the operating environment remains challenging, characterized by market volatility and macroeconomic headwinds, geo-political and ESG considerations, intensifying competition, and/uni00A0evolving capital and regulatory requirements. These factors may affect corporate and investor sentiment and market and business conditions in a positive or/uni00A0negative manner which makes capital markets results difficult to forecast. TD Securities' increasingly diversified and client-focused business model should be well positioned to support future growth.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW\n\n## Summary of 2021 Performance\n\n## NET INCOME\n\nReported net income for the year was $14,298 million, an increase of $2,403 million, or 20%, compared with prior year. The increase primarily reflects lower PCL, higher revenues in the Wealth Management and Insurance business, and lower insurance claims and related expenses, partially offset by a net gain on sale of the/uni00A0Bank's investment in TD/uni00A0Ameritrade in the prior year, higher non-interest expenses, lower revenue in the U.S. Retail business and a lower contribution from the/uni00A0Bank's investment in Schwab as compared with the contribution from the/uni00A0Bank's investment in TD/uni00A0Ameritrade in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, net income for the year was $14,649 million, an increase of/uni00A0$4,681/uni00A0million, or 47%, compared with the prior year. The reported ROE for the year was 15.5%, compared with 13.6% prior year. The adjusted ROE for the year was 15.9%, compared with 11.4% in the prior year.\n\nReported diluted EPS for the year was $7.72, an increase of 20%, compared with $6.43 prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was $7.91, a 48% increase, compared with $5.36 in the prior year.\n\nReported revenue was $42,693/uni00A0million, a decrease of $953/uni00A0million, or 2%, compared with prior year. Adjusted revenue was $42,693/uni00A0million, an/uni00A0increase of $468/uni00A0million, or 1%, compared with the prior year.\n\n## NET INTEREST INCOME\n\nNet interest income for the year was $24,131/uni00A0million, a decrease of $366/uni00A0million, or 1%, compared with prior year. The decrease reflects lower margins in the U.S. Retail and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segments, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by volume growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses, and higher trading net interest income.\n\n## NON-INTEREST INCOME\n\nReported non-interest income for the year was $18,562 million, a decrease of $587 million, or 3%, compared with prior year reflecting the net gain on sale of the/uni00A0Bank's investment in TD/uni00A0Ameritrade in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income for the year was $18,562 million, an increase of $834 million, or 5%, compared with prior year reflecting higher fee and transaction-based revenue in the wealth and banking businesses, insurance volumes, and higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities. These were partially offset by lower wholesale trading revenue, and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims.\n\n## PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nPCL for the year was a recovery of $224 million, lower by $7,466 million, compared with prior year. PCL - impaired was $1,309 million, a decrease of $1,654/uni00A0million, or 56%, largely related to improved credit conditions and prior year credit migration in the Wholesale lending portfolio. PCL/uni00A0performing was a recovery of $1,533 million, lower by $5,812 million, reflecting a performing allowance increase in the prior year, and allowance release this year largely related to improved credit conditions, including a more favourable economic outlook. Total PCL as a percentage of credit volume was -0.03%.\n\n## INSURANCE CLAIMS AND RELATED EXPENSES\n\nInsurance claims and related expenses were $2,707 million, a decrease of $179 million, or 6%, compared with prior year reflecting more favourable current year claims experience and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by higher current year claims from business growth.\n\n## NON-INTEREST EXPENSES\n\nReported non-interest expenses for the year were $23,076 million, an increase of $1,472 million, or 7%, reflecting an increase in the retailer program partners' net share of the profits from the U.S. strategic cards portfolio, primarily as a result of lower PCL which accounted for approximately 5% of the increase. Non-interest expenses also reflect higher employee-related expenses and higher spend supporting business growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation and prior year charges related to the Greystone acquisition, which collectively accounted for 2% of the increase. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $22,909 million, an increase of $1,571 million, or 7%.\n\n## PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nReported total income and other taxes increased by $2,509 million, or 91.7%, compared with prior year, reflecting an increase in income tax expense of $2,469/uni00A0million, or 214.3%, and an increase in other taxes of $40 million, or 2.5%. Adjusted total income and other taxes increased by $1,678 million from prior year, or 46.6%, reflecting an increase in income tax expense of $1,638 million, or 81.1%.\n\nThe Bank's reported effective tax rate was 21.1% for 2021, compared with 9.7% prior year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impact of higher pre-tax income as well as the impact of the sale of the/uni00A0Bank's investment in TD/uni00A0Ameritrade in the prior year. For a reconciliation of the/uni00A0Bank's effective income tax rate with the Canadian statutory income tax rate, refer to Note 25 of the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Bank reported its investments in Schwab and TD/uni00A0Ameritrade using the equity method of accounting. Schwab's tax expense ($280 million in the current year) and TD/uni00A0Ameritrade's tax expense ($378 million in the prior year) were not part of the/uni00A0Bank's effective tax rate.\n\n## BALANCE SHEET\n\nTotal assets were $1,729 billion as at October 31, 2021, an increase of $13/uni00A0billion, or 1%, from October 31, 2020. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $56 billion, or approximately 3%. The increase in total assets reflects debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC), net of allowance for credit losses of $41 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $5 billion and non-trading financial assets at FVTPL of $1/uni00A0billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $24 billion, cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $5 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $2 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $1/uni00A0billion, other assets of $1 billion and investment in Schwab of $1 billion.\n\nTotal liabilities were $1,629 billion as at October 31, 2021, an increase of $9 billion, or 1%, from October 31, 2020. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total liabilities by $59 billion, or approximately 4%. The increase in total liabilities reflects financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $54/uni00A0billion, derivatives of $4 billion, trading deposits of $4 billion and other liabilities of $2 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $45 billion and deposits of $10 billion.\n\nEquity was $100 billion as at October 31, 2021, an increase of $4/uni00A0billion, or 5%, from October 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflects an increase/uni00A0in retained earnings, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.",

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total assets by $79 billion, or approximately 5%.\n\nThe increase in total assets reflects loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $108 billion, DSAC, net of allowance for credit losses of $74/uni00A0billion, derivatives of $49 billion, and non-trading financial assets at FVTPL of $2/uni00A0billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $20/uni00A0billion, financial assets at FVOCI of $9 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $7 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $4 billion, investment in Schwab of $3 billion, other assets of $1 billion.\n\nCash and interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $20 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nTrading loans, securities, and other decreased $4/uni00A0billion primarily in equity securities, partially offset by increase in government-related securities and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nNon-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss increased $2/uni00A0billion reflecting new investments.\n\nDerivative assets increased $49 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income decreased $9/uni00A0billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales, partially offset\n\nby new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nDebt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses increased $74/uni00A0billion reflecting new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities and sales.\n\n## Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements\n\ndecreased $7/uni00A0billion primarily reflecting a decrease in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $108/uni00A0billion reflecting volume growth in business and government loans, real estate secured lending, and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nInvestment in Schwab decreased $3 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the/uni00A0Bank's share of Schwab's other comprehensive loss and a reduction in the/uni00A0Bank's ownership interest in Schwab with the sale of approximately 28 million shares, partially offset by the/uni00A0Bank's share of Schwab's net income and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nOther assets decreased $1 billion primarily in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients reflecting lower volumes of pending trades, partially offset by increase in current income tax receivable, and the impact of foreign exchange translation.",

        "page_content": "Total liabilities were $1,806/uni00A0billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase of $177/uni00A0billion, or 11%, from October/uni00A031, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total liabilities by $83 billion, or approximately 5%.\n\nThe increase in total liabilities reflects deposits of $105/uni00A0billion, financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $49/uni00A0billion, derivatives of $34 billion, other liabilities of $4/uni00A0billion and trading deposits of $1/uni00A0billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $16 billion.\n\nTrading deposits increased $1/uni00A0billion primarily reflecting impact of/uni00A0foreign exchange translation.\n\nDerivative liabilities increased $34 billion primarily reflecting changes in/uni00A0mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nincreased $49/uni00A0billion primarily reflecting new issuances and the impact of/uni00A0foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities.\n\n## GROUP FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Credit Portfolio Quality\n\n## AT A GLANCE OVERVIEW\n\n- \u00b7 Loans and acceptances, net of allowance for loan losses were $853/uni00A0billion, an increase of $110 billion compared with last year.\n- \u00b7 Impaired loans net of Stage 3 allowances were $1,746 million, a/uni00A0decrease of $36 million compared with last year.\n- \u00b7 Provision for credit losses was $1,067 million, compared with a/uni00A0recovery of $224 million last year.\n- \u00b7 Total allowance for credit losses including off-balance sheet positions increased by $111 million to $7,366 million.\n\n## LOAN PORTFOLIO\n\nThe Bank increased its loans and acceptances net of allowance for loan losses by $110 billion, or 15%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting volume growth in the business and government and real estate secured lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange.\n\nWhile the majority of the/uni00A0Bank's credit risk exposure is related to loans/uni00A0and acceptances, the/uni00A0Bank also engaged in activities that have offbalance sheet credit risk. These include credit instruments and derivative financial instruments, as explained in Note 31 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\n\nThe Bank's loan portfolio continued to be concentrated in Canadian and U.S. residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans, representing 63% of total loans net of Stage/uni00A03 allowances, down 3% from 2021. During the year, these portfolios increased by $47 billion, or 10%, and totalled $536 billion at year end. Residential mortgages represented 34% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances in 2022, down 2% from 2021. Consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans were 28% of total loans net of/uni00A0Stage 3 allowances in 2022, down 2% from 2021.\n\nDeposits increased $105/uni00A0billion reflecting volume growth in business and/uni00A0government deposits and deposit with banks, and the impact of/uni00A0foreign exchange translation, partially offset by lower volumes in personal deposits.\n\n## Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\ndecreased $16/uni00A0billion reflecting a decrease in volume, partially offset by\n\nthe impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nOther liabilities increased $4 billion primarily reflecting an increase in/uni00A0liabilities related to structured entities and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nEquity was $111/uni00A0billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase of $12/uni00A0billion from October/uni00A031, 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in retained earnings, and preferred shares and other equity instruments, partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by losses on cash flow hedges and from the/uni00A0Bank's share of the other comprehensive loss from the investment in Schwab, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nThe Bank's business and government loan portfolio was 38% of total/uni00A0loans net of Stage 3 allowances, up 4% from 2021. The largest business and government sector concentrations in Canada were the Real/uni00A0estate and Financial sectors, which comprised 6% and 2% of net/uni00A0loans, respectively. Real estate and Financial sectors were the largest/uni00A0U.S. sector concentrations in 2022, representing 4% and 3% of/uni00A0net loans, respectively.\n\nGeographically, the credit portfolio remained concentrated in Canada. In 2022, the percentage of loans net of Stage 3 allowances held in Canada was 66%, down 3% from 2021. The largest Canadian regional exposure was in Ontario, which represented 39% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances for 2022, compared with 40% in the prior year.\n\nThe remaining credit portfolio was predominantly in the U.S., which represented 32% of loans net of Stage 3 allowances, up 2% from 2021. Exposures to acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans, and other geographic regions were relatively small. The largest U.S. regional exposures were in/uni00A0New York, New England, and New Jersey which represented 6%, 5%, and 3% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances, respectively, compared with 6%, 5%, and 4% in the prior year.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), the/uni00A0Bank calculates allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI. The Bank has $407/uni00A0billion in such debt securities of which $407/uni00A0billion are performing securities (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired. The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at/uni00A0FVOCI was $1/uni00A0million and $2/uni00A0million, respectively.",

includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the/uni00A0Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the/uni00A0Bank's real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers' default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either\n\n- 4 The states included in New England are as follows: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\n- 5 Includes loans attributable to other states/regions including those outside TD's core U.S. geographic footprint.\n\ngovernment-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination.\n\nThe Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the/uni00A0Bank's overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.",

All figures are calculated based on current customer payment amounts, including voluntary payments larger than the original contractual amounts and/or other voluntary prepayments. The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due.\n\nBalances with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period.

Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $92 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.\n\nIn Canada, impaired loans net of Stage 3 allowances decreased by $25 million, or 5% in 2022. Residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit cards, had net impaired loans of $295 million, a decrease of $57 million, or 16%, impacted by improved credit conditions, and largely reflected in the residential mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Business and government impaired loans net of Stage/uni00A03 allowances were $193 million, an increase of $32 million, or 20%, compared with the prior year, as new formations outpaced resolutions.\n\n- 4 HELOC loan-to-value includes first position collateral mortgage if applicable.\n- 5 HELOC fixed rate advantage option is included in loan-to-value calculation.\n- 6 The territories are included as follows: Yukon is included in British Columbia; Nunavut is included in Ontario; and the Northwest Territories is included in the Prairies region.\n\nIn the U.S., net impaired loans decreased by $11 million, or 1% in 2022. Residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit cards, had net impaired loans of $990 million, an increase of $69 million, or 7%, compared with the prior year reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and some normalization of credit performance. Business and government net impaired loans were $268 million, a decrease of $80 million, or 23%, compared with the prior year reflecting resolutions outpacing new formations, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.\n\nGeographically, 28% of total net impaired loans were located in Canada and 72% in the U.S. The largest regional concentration of net impaired loans in Canada was in Ontario, representing 15% of total net impaired loans, compared with 14% in the prior year. The largest regional concentration of net impaired loans in the U.S. was in New York, representing 18% of total net impaired loans, compared with 18% in the/uni00A0prior year.",

measured at FVOCI.\n- 4 Excludes ACI loans.\n- 5 Credit cards are considered impaired when they are 90 days past due and written off at 180 days past due.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nThe allowance for credit losses including off-balance sheet positions of $7,366 million as at October 31, 2022, was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $764 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,644/uni00A0million, and Stage 1 allowance of $2,955 million, and allowance for debt securities of $3/uni00A0million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\n## Stage 3 allowances (impaired)\n\nThe Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $126 million, or 20%, compared with last year, reflecting some normalization of credit performance, and the impact of foreign exchange.\n\n## Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances (performing)\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the performing allowance was $6,599 million, down from $6,608 million as at October 31, 2021. The decrease this year largely reflected improved credit conditions, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The performing allowance change included an increase of $20 million attributable to the partners' share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolios. The performing allowance for debt securities decreased by $6 million compared with last year.\n\nForward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of ECLs based on the/uni00A0Bank's experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the/uni00A0Bank's ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the/uni00A0Bank's recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information.\n\n- 6 The territories are included as follows: Yukon is included in British Columbia; Nunavut is included in Ontario; and the Northwest Territories is included in the Prairies region.\n- 7 The states included in New England are as follows: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\n\nThe probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the/uni00A0Bank's forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\n## PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nThe PCL is the amount charged to income to bring the total allowance for credit losses, including both Stage 1 and 2 allowances (performing) and Stage 3 allowance (impaired), to a level that management considers adequate to absorb expected and incurred credit-related losses in the/uni00A0Bank's loan portfolio. Provisions are reduced by any recoveries in the year.\n\nIn Canada, PCL - impaired related to residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans was $565/uni00A0million, an increase of $12 million, or 2%, compared to 2021. PCL/uni00A0- impaired related to business and government loans was $97 million, a decrease of $5/uni00A0million or 5%, compared with last year.\n\nIn the U.S., PCL - impaired related to residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans was $743/uni00A0million, an increase of $154 million, or 26%, compared to 2021, largely related to some normalization of credit performance and the impact of foreign exchange. PCL - impaired related to business and government loans was $37 million, a decrease of $36 million or 49%, compared with last year, largely reflecting improved credit conditions.\n\nGeographically, the largest regional concentration of PCL - impaired in Canada was in Ontario. The largest regional concentration of PCL impaired in the U.S. was in New York.",

        "page_content": "## THE BANK'S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe Bank's capital management objectives are:\n\n- \u00b7 To be an appropriately capitalized financial institution as determined by: - the/uni00A0Bank's Risk Appetite Statement (RAS);\n- - capital requirements defined by relevant regulatory authorities; and\n- - the/uni00A0Bank's internal assessment of capital requirements, including stress test analysis, consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile and risk tolerance levels.\n- \u00b7 To have the most economic weighted-average cost of capital achievable, while preserving the appropriate mix of capital elements to/uni00A0meet targeted capitalization levels.\n- \u00b7 To ensure ready access to sources of appropriate capital, at reasonable cost, in order to:\n- - insulate the/uni00A0Bank from unexpected loss events; and\n- - support and facilitate business growth and/or acquisitions consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 To support strong external debt ratings, in order to manage the/uni00A0Bank's overall cost of funds and to maintain access to required funding.\n\nThese objectives are applied in a manner consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's overall objective of providing a satisfactory return on shareholders' equity.\n\n## CAPITAL SOURCES\n\nThe Bank's capital is primarily derived from common shareholders and retained earnings. Other sources of capital include the/uni00A0Bank's preferred shareholders, limited recourse capital noteholders, and holders of the/uni00A0Bank's subordinated debt.\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM) group manages capital for the/uni00A0Bank and is responsible for forecasting and monitoring compliance with capital targets, on a consolidated basis, with oversight provided by Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO). The Board of Directors (the 'Board') oversees capital adequacy risk management.\n\nThe Bank continues to hold sufficient capital levels to ensure that flexibility is maintained to grow operations, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. The strong capital ratios are the result of the/uni00A0Bank's internal capital generation, management of the balance sheet, and periodic issuance of capital securities.\n\n## ECONOMIC CAPITAL\n\nEconomic capital is the/uni00A0Bank's internal measure of capital requirements and is one of the key components in the/uni00A0Bank's internal assessment of capital adequacy. Economic capital is comprised of both risk-based capital required to fund losses that could occur under extremely adverse economic or operational conditions and investment capital utilized to fund acquisitions or investments to support future earnings growth.\n\nThe Bank uses internal models to determine the amount of riskbased capital required to support the risks resulting from the/uni00A0Bank's business operations. Characteristics of these models are described in the 'Managing Risk' section of this document. The objective of the/uni00A0Bank's economic capital framework is to hold risk-based capital to cover unexpected losses in a manner consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's capital management objectives.\n\nThe Bank operates its capital regime under the Basel Capital Framework. Consequently, in addition to addressing Pillar 1 risks covering credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, the/uni00A0Bank's economic capital framework captures other material Pillar 2 risks including non-trading market risk for the retail portfolio (interest rate risk in the banking book), additional credit risk due to concentration (commercial and wholesale portfolios) and risks classified as 'Other', namely business risk, insurance risk, and risks associated with the/uni00A0Bank's significant investments. The framework also captures diversification benefits across risk types and business segments.\n\nPlease refer to the 'Economic Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets by Segment' section for a business segment breakdown of the/uni00A0Bank's economic capital.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL\n\nCapital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the 'Capital Position' section of this document.\n\n## OSFI's Capital Requirements under Basel III\n\nOSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements are noted below.\n\nEffective January 1, 2013, all newly issued non-common Tier 1 and\n\nTier/uni00A02 Capital instruments must include non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions to qualify as regulatory capital. NVCC provisions require the conversion of non-common capital instruments into a variable number of common shares of the/uni00A0Bank upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event. A/uni00A0Trigger Event is currently defined in the CAR guideline as an event where OSFI determines that the/uni00A0Bank is, or is about to become, non-viable and that after conversion of all non-common capital instruments and consideration of any other relevant factors or circumstances, the viability of the/uni00A0Bank is expected to be restored, or if the/uni00A0Bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government of Canada without which the/uni00A0Bank would have been determined by OSFI to be non-viable. Existing non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments which do not include NVCC provisions are non-qualifying capital instruments and are subject to a phase-out period which began in 2013 and ended in 2022.\n\nThe CAR guideline sets the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios at 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. OSFI also expects Canadian banks to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. Additionally, the six Canadian banks designated as D-SIBs, including TD, are subject to a 1% common equity surcharge.\n\nThe Canadian banks are also required to hold a countercyclical capital buffer (CCB), which may range from 0% to 2.5%, and be met with CET1 capital. The CCB is calculated using the weighted-average of the buffers deployed in Canada and across BCBS member jurisdictions and selected non-member jurisdictions to which the/uni00A0Bank has private sector credit exposures. Due to COVID-19, several foreign jurisdictions have released, reduced or delayed planned increases in their CCBs. Canada's CCB remains unchanged at 0%. Based on the allocation of exposures and buffers currently in place, the/uni00A0Bank's countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as at October 31, 2022.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to a previously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffer through the introduction of the public Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks associated with systemic vulnerabilities. The level of the buffer ranges between 0% and 2.5% of total RWA and must be met with CET1 Capital. At a minimum, OSFI will review the buffer semi-annually and any changes will be made public. The DSB was 2.5% as at October 31, 2022.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2018, OSFI implemented a revised methodology for calculating the regulatory capital floor. The revised floor is based on the Basel II standardized approach with a factor applied. The floor factor was lowered to 70%, from 75%, effective April 9, 2020. The Bank is not currently constrained by the capital floor.\n\nOn September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI's TLAC guideline. Under this guideline, the/uni00A0Bank is required to meet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio.",

The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the/uni00A0Bank's 1% G-SIB additional common equity requirement. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the/uni00A0Bank's G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%.\n\nThe Bank's Leverage Ratio is calculated as per OSFI's Leverage Requirements guideline and has a regulatory minimum requirement of/uni00A03%, and the/uni00A0Bank is required to meet a supervisory TLAC leverage ratio/uni00A0target of 6.75%.\n\nIn July 2019, in consideration of the final Basel III revisions published by the BCBS in December 2017, OSFI published guidance related to the capital requirements for operational risk. Banks currently approved to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) will be required to use a revised Basel III standardized approach when the revised requirements are implemented in Canada. OSFI provided a transition period for fiscal 2020 through to 2022, during which time banks currently approved to use AMA are required to report operational risk capital using the current standardized approach.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs' ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. Selected measures, which continued to be in effect in 2021 or 2022 are summarized below.\n\n- \u00b7 On March 13, 2020, OSFI lowered the DSB to 1.00%, and set the expectation for all federally regulated financial institutions that dividend increases and share buybacks should be halted. On June 17, 2021, OSFI announced that the DSB would increase to 2.50% of total riskweighted assets, effective October 31, 2021, and this was reaffirmed on December 10, 2021 and on June 22, 2022. On November 4, 2021, OSFI lifted the temporary expectation that financial institutions not increase regular dividends or undertake share repurchases.\n- \u00b7 On March 27, 2020, OSFI announced additional measures, including: - Transitional arrangements for ECL provisioning available under the Basel Framework would be introduced. The adjustment allowed a portion of the increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances relative to a baseline level to be included in CET1 capital, rather than Tier 2 Capital, as the CAR guideline specifies. The baseline level is the sum of Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances as at the first quarter of 2020 (for October year-end deposit-taking institutions (DTIs)). This increase is tax effected and is subject to a scaling factor, which was set at 70% in fiscal 2020, 50% in fiscal 2021, and 25% in fiscal 2022.\n- - The loan exposures in the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program, which was funded by the Government of Canada, can be excluded from the risk-based capital ratios and from leverage ratio calculations. For the Export Development Canada Business Credit Availability Program, the government-guaranteed portion of the loan is treated as a sovereign exposure, with the remaining portion treated as a loan to the borrower. The entire amount of the loan is included in leverage ratio calculations. On January 12, 2022, the Government of Canada announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December/uni00A031,/uni00A02023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.\n\n- 2 The Bank's countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of July 31, 2022.\n- 3 The DSB increased to 2.5%, from 1.0%, of total RWA effective October 31, 2021.\n- \u00b7 On April 9, 2020, OSFI announced DTIs could temporarily exclude exposures from central bank reserves and sovereign-issued securities that qualify as High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline from the leverage ratio measures. On August 12, 2021, OSFI confirmed that the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities would not extend past December 31, 2021. On September 13, 2022, OSFI announced that the temporary measure to exclude central bank reserves in determining the leverage exposure will expire on April 1, 2023.\n- \u00b7 On April 23, 2020, OSFI clarified that PPP loans pledged under the Boston Federal Reserve's PPP Lending Facility can be excluded from the risk-based capital and leverage ratios.\n\nOn January 27, 2021, OSFI published guidance on the treatment of new loans to businesses through the Government of Canada's Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program (HASCAP), announced on January/uni00A026,/uni00A02021. HASCAP loans are treated as sovereign exposures based on the Business Development Bank of Canada guarantee and the/uni00A0relevant risk weight applied under OSFI's CAR guideline. The entire amount of the loan is included in the lender's leverage ratio calculations. The Bank began originating loans under the HASCAP program in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## Capital Position and Capital Ratios\n\nThe Basel framework allows qualifying banks to determine capital levels consistent with the way they measure, manage, and mitigate risks. It specifies methodologies for the measurement of credit, trading market, and operational risks. The Bank uses the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB) approach to credit risk for all material portfolios.\n\nFor accounting purposes, IFRS is followed for consolidation of subsidiaries and joint ventures. For regulatory capital purposes, all the subsidiaries of the/uni00A0Bank are consolidated except for insurance subsidiaries which are deconsolidated and follow prescribed treatment per OSFI's CAR guidelines. Insurance subsidiaries are subject to their own capital adequacy reporting, such as OSFI's Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test.\n\nSome of the/uni00A0Bank's subsidiaries are individually regulated by either OSFI or other regulators. Many of these subsidiaries have minimum capital requirements which may limit the/uni00A0Bank's ability to extract capital or funds for other uses.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios were 16.2%, 18.3%, and 20.7%, respectively. The increase in the/uni00A0Bank's CET1 Capital ratio from 15.2% as at October 31, 2021, was attributable primarily to organic capital growth, the issuance of common shares pursuant to the/uni00A0Bank's dividend reinvestment plan, the sale of Schwab shares, mark-to-market gains on swaps de-designated from hedge accounting relationships to mitigate the impacts of interest rate volatility to closing capital for the First Horizon acquisition, and a decrease in the threshold deduction for non-significant investment in financial entities. The increase was partially offset by RWA growth across all segments, common shares repurchased, unrealized losses on FVOCI securities, and the reduction in the scaling factor related to OSFI's transition arrangement for ECL provisioning, from 50% in fiscal 2021 to 25% in fiscal 2022.",

        "page_content": "As at October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's leverage ratio was 4.9%. Compared with the/uni00A0Bank's leverage ratio of 4.8% at October 31, 2021, the leverage ratio increased primarily due to organic growth, partially offset by organic leverage exposure growth and the expiration of the exclusion of sovereignissued securities from the leverage ratio measure on December 31, 2021.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\n\nCET1 Capital was $84 billion as at October/uni00A031, 2022. Earnings contributed the majority of CET1 Capital growth in the year. Capital management funding activities during the year included common share issuance of $1.6/uni00A0billion under the dividend reinvestment plan and from stock option exercises, partially offset by common shares repurchased.\n\n## Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital\n\nTier 1 Capital was $94.4 billion as at October 31, 2022, consisting of CET1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital of $83.7 billion and $10.7/uni00A0billion, respectively. The Bank's Tier 1 Capital management activities during the year consisted of the redemption of one Tier 1-qualifying capital instrument and the issuance of four Tier 1-qualifying capital instruments as follows:\n\n- (i) On November 1, 2021, TD Capital Trust IV redeemed all of the outstanding TD Capital Trust IV Notes - Series 2.\n- (ii)  On April 4, 2022, and July 25, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank issued 850,000 and 800,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Fixed Rate Reset Preferred Shares NVCC, Series 27 (the 'Series 27 Shares') and Series 28 (the/uni00A0'Series 28 Shares'), respectively, resulting in gross proceeds of/uni00A0$1,650 million. On September 14, 2022, and October 17,/uni00A02022, the/uni00A0Bank issued $1,500 million and US$1,750 million of Limited Recourse Capital Notes NVCC (the 'LRCNs'), Series 2 and Series/uni00A03, respectively, with recourse limited to assets held in a trust/uni00A0consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank (the 'Limited Recourse Trust').\n\nTier 2 Capital was $12.7 billion as at October 31, 2022. There were no/uni00A0Tier/uni00A02 Capital management activities during the year.\n\n## INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is an integrated enterprise-wide process that encompasses the governance, management, and control of risk and capital functions within the/uni00A0Bank. It provides a framework for relating risks to capital requirements through the/uni00A0Bank's capital modelling and stress testing practices which help inform the/uni00A0Bank's overall capital adequacy requirements.\n\nThe ICAAP is led by Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM) and is supported by numerous functional areas who collectively help assess the/uni00A0Bank's internal capital adequacy. This assessment evaluates the capacity to bear risk in congruence with the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile and RAS. TBSM assesses and monitors the overall adequacy of the/uni00A0Bank's available capital in relation to both internal and regulatory capital requirements under normal and stressed conditions.\n\n## DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe Bank's ability to pay dividends is subject to the requirements of the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) and OSFI. Refer to Note 21 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on dividend restrictions.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, OSFI issued a news release announcing a series of/uni00A0measures to support the resilience of financial institutions in response to/uni00A0challenges posed by COVID-19. These measures included the expectation that all federally regulated financial institutions halt dividend increases and share buybacks. On November 4, 2021, OSFI lifted the temporary expectation that financial institutions refrain from increasing regular dividends or undertaking share repurchases, effective immediately.\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\nOn November 30, 2022, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of ninety-six cents (96 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the/uni00A0Bank for the quarter ending January 31, 2023, payable on and after January 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 6, 2023.\n\nAt October/uni00A031, 2022, the quarterly dividend was $0.89 per common share. Common share cash dividends declared and paid during the year totalled $3.56 per share (2021 - $3.16), representing a payout ratio of 43%, consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's target payout range of 40-50% of adjusted earnings. For cash dividends payable on the/uni00A0Bank's preferred shares, refer to Note 21 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. As at October 31, 2022, 1,821 million common shares were outstanding (2021 - 1,822 million).\n\n## DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN\n\nThe Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the/uni00A0Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to/uni00A05% at the/uni00A0Bank's discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. The Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the/uni00A0Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2022, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the/uni00A0Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 14.5 million common shares with a 2% discount.

For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares series issued in connection with such LRCNs, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate.\n\nFor NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.2 billion in aggregate.\n\n## Future Regulatory Capital Developments\n\nOn January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. The Leverage Requirements Guideline revisions include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The revised rules are effective in the second quarter of 2023, with the exception of those related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk which are effective in 2024.\n\nOn June 28, 2022, OSFI released an Advisory (Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products under Guideline B-20), which will result in mortgage loans which do not meet OSFI Guideline B-20 expectations to be treated as investor mortgages under Basel III reforms and attract higher risk weights.\n\nOn November 7, 2022, OSFI announced a new Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns guideline. This guideline lays out OSFI's approach to enhancing and aligning assurance expectations over capital, leverage and liquidity returns, including an external audit opinion on the numerator and denominator of key regulatory ratios, senior management attestation on regulatory returns, and an internal audit opinion on the processes and controls followed in preparing these returns. The assurance requirements for D-SIBs' capital, liquidity and leverage returns for internal audit commence in fiscal 2023; the internal review and senior management attestation requirements commence in fiscal 2024; and the external audit assurance requirements commence in fiscal 2025.\n\n## Global Systemically Important Banks Designation and Disclosures\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with the BCBS and national authorities, identifies G-SIBs. In July 2013, the BCBS issued an update to the final rules on G-SIBs and outlined the G-SIB assessment methodology which is based on the submissions of the largest global banks. Twelve indicators are used in the G-SIB assessment methodology to determine systemic importance. The score for a particular indicator is calculated by dividing the individual bank value by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks included in the assessment.",

        "page_content": "Accordingly, an individual bank's ranking is reliant on the results and submissions of other global banks. The update also provided clarity on the public disclosure requirements of the twelve indicators used in the assessment methodology.\n\nThe Bank is required to publish the twelve indicators used in the G-SIB indicator-based assessment framework. Public disclosure of financial year-end data is required annually, no later than the date of a bank's first quarter public disclosure of shareholder financial data in the following year.\n\nThe public communications on G-SIB status are issued annually each November. On November 22, 2019, the/uni00A0Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. The Bank continued to maintain its G-SIB status when the FSB published the 2022 list of G-SIBs on November 21, 2022. As a result of this designation, the/uni00A0Bank is subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1% under applicable FSB member authority requirements; however, in accordance with OSFI's CAR guideline, for Canadian banks designated as a G-SIB, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply. As the D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the incremental 1% G-SIB common equity ratio requirement,\n\nthe/uni00A0Bank's G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the/uni00A0Bank's minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the/uni00A0Bank's G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a/uni00A0maximum of 4.5%.\n\nAs a result of the/uni00A0Bank's G-SIB designation, the U.S. Federal Reserve requires TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS), as TD's U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC and long-term debt. From the date the/uni00A0Bank was designated as a G-SIB, TDGUS has a three-year transitional period to meet these requirements by January 1, 2023 and is expected to meet these requirements by such date.\n\nIn July 2018, BCBS issued a revised G-SIB framework; G-SIBs: revised assessment methodology and the higher loss absorbency requirement. The new assessment methodology introduces a trading volume indicator and modifies the weights in the substitutability category, amends the definition of cross-jurisdictional indicators, extends the scope of consolidation to insurance subsidiaries, and provides further guidance on bucket migration and associated loss absorbency surcharges. The revised methodology was implemented in 2022, using the 2021 year-end data.\n\n## GROUP FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of operations, the/uni00A0Bank engages in a variety of financial transactions that, under IFRS, are either not recorded on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet or are recorded in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. These off-balance sheet arrangements involve, among other risks, varying elements of market, credit, and liquidity risks which are discussed in the 'Managing Risk' section of this document. Off-balance sheet arrangements are generally undertaken for risk management, capital management, and funding management purposes and include securitizations, contractual obligations, and certain commitments and guarantees.\n\n## STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nTD carries out certain business activities through arrangements with structured entities (SEs). The Bank uses SEs to raise capital, obtain sources of liquidity by securitizing certain of the/uni00A0Bank's financial assets, to assist TD's clients in securitizing their financial assets, and to create investment products for the/uni00A0Bank's clients. Securitizations are an important part of the financial markets, providing liquidity by facilitating investor access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. Refer to Notes 2, 9, and 10 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the/uni00A0Bank's involvement with SEs.\n\n## Securitization of Bank-Originated Assets\n\nThe Bank securitizes residential mortgages, credit card loans, and business and government loans to enhance its liquidity position, to diversify sources of funding, and to optimize the management of the balance sheet.\n\nThe Bank securitizes residential mortgages under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The securitization of the residential mortgages with the CMHC does not qualify for derecognition and the mortgages remain on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the/uni00A0Bank securitizes credit card loans by selling them to Bank-sponsored SEs that are consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank. The/uni00A0Bank also securitizes U.S. residential mortgages with U.S. governmentsponsored entities which qualify for derecognition and are removed from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Notes 9 and 10 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## T A B L E 4 1 | EXPOSURES SECURITIZED BY THE BANK AS ORIGINATOR 1\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)   | As at                            | As at                          | As at               | As at                                  |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Significant  unconsolidated  SEs | Significant  consolidated  SEs |                     | Non-SE third-parties                   |\n|                                  | Securitized  assets              | Securitized  assets            | Securitized  assets | Carrying value  of retained  interests |\n|                                  |                                  |                                | October 31, 2022    | October 31, 2022                       |\n| Residential mortgage loans       | $ 21,767                         | $  -                           | $  916              | $ -                                    |\n| Credit card loans                | -                                | 1,725                          | -                   | -                                      |\n| Business and government loans    | -                                | -                              | 591                 | 5                                      |\n| Total exposure                   | $ 21,767                         | $ 1,725                        | $ 1,507             | $ 5                                    |\n|                                  |                                  |                                | October 31, 2021    | October 31, 2021                       |\n| Residential mortgage loans       | $ 23,232                         | $  -                           | $ 1,135             | $ -                                    |\n| Credit card loans                | -                                | 1,810                          | -                   | -                                      |\n| Business and government loans    | -                                | -                              | 763                 | 9                                      |\n| Total exposure                   | $ 23,232                         | $ 1,810                        | $ 1,898             | $ 9                                    |",

        "page_content": "## Residential Mortgage Loans\n\nThe Bank securitizes residential mortgage loans through significant unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Residential mortgage loans securitized by the/uni00A0Bank may give rise to full derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the/uni00A0Bank fully derecognizes residential mortgage loans, the/uni00A0Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests.\n\n## Credit Card Loans\n\nThe Bank securitizes credit card loans through an SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the/uni00A0Bank's assets, the/uni00A0Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. As at October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank had $2 billion of securitized credit card receivables outstanding (October 31, 2021 - $2 billion). Due to the nature of the credit card receivables, their carrying amounts approximate fair value.\n\n## Business and Government Loans\n\nThe Bank securitizes business and government loans through Canadian non-SE third parties. Business and government loans securitized by the/uni00A0Bank may be derecognized from the/uni00A0Bank's balance sheet depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where\n\nthe/uni00A0Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the/uni00A0Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. There are no ECLs on the retained interests of the securitized business and government loans as the loans are all government insured.\n\n## Securitization of Third-Party Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities\n\nMulti-Seller Conduits\n\nThe Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Banksponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD's maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $10.8 billion as at October 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 - $10.5 billion). In addition, as/uni00A0at October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank had committed to provide an additional $2.1/uni00A0billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future assetbacked commercial paper (ABCP) in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2021 - $2.1 billion).\n\n## T A B L E 4 2 | EXPOSURE TO THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATED ASSETS SECURITIZED BY BANK-SPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED CONDUITS\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)   | As at                                                        | As at                                      | As at                                                       | As at                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                   | October 31, 2022                                             | October 31, 2022                           | October 31, 2021                                            | October 31, 2021                            |\n|                                                   | Exposure  and ratings  profile of  unconsolidated  SEs AAA 1 | Expected  weighted- average life (years) 2 | Exposure and  ratings profile of  unconsolidated  SEs AAA 1 | Expected  weighted-  average life (years) 2 |\n| Residential mortgage loans                        | $  6,058                                                     | 3.3                                        | $  5,395                                                    | 3.5                                         |\n| Automobile loans and leases                       | 3,890                                                        | 2.6                                        | 4,349                                                       | 2.5                                         |\n| Equipment leases                                  | 510                                                          | 2.8                                        | 408                                                         | 2.6                                         |\n| Trade receivables                                 | 306                                                          | 1.2                                        | 306                                                         | 1.5                                         |\n| Investment loans                                  | 81                                                           | 4.4                                        | -                                                           | -                                           |\n| Total exposure                                    | $ 10,845                                                     | 3.0                                        | $ 10,458                                                    | 3.0                                         |\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank held $1.8 billion of ABCP issued by/uni00A0Bank-sponsored multi-seller conduits within the Trading loans, securities, and other category on its 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheet (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $1.7/uni00A0billion).\n\n## OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURE TO THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED/uni00A0CONDUITS\n\nThe Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3.1/uni00A0billion as at October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $2.5/uni00A0billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements.\n\n## COMMITMENTS\n\nThe Bank enters into various commitments to meet the financing needs of the/uni00A0Bank's clients, to earn fee income, and to lease premises and equipment. Significant commitments of the/uni00A0Bank include financial and performance standby letters of credit, documentary and commercial letters of credit, commitments to extend credit, and obligations under longterm non-cancellable leases for premises and equipment. These products may expose the/uni00A0Bank to liquidity, credit, and reputational risks. There are adequate risk management and control processes in place to mitigate these risks. Certain commitments still remain off-balance sheet. Note/uni00A027 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements provides detailed information about the/uni00A0Bank's commitments including credit-related arrangements and long-term commitments or leases.\n\n## GUARANTEES\n\nIn the normal course of business, the/uni00A0Bank enters into various guarantee contracts to support its clients. The Bank's significant types of guarantee products are financial and performance standby letters of credit, credit enhancements, and indemnification agreements. Certain guarantees remain off-balance sheet. Refer to Note 27 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.",

The Bank considers certain of its officers and directors to be key management personnel. The Bank makes loans to its key management personnel, their close family members, and their related entities on market terms and conditions with the exception of banking products and services for key management personnel, which are subject to approved policy guidelines that govern all employees.\n\nIn addition, the/uni00A0Bank offers deferred share and other plans to nonemployee directors, executives, and certain other key employees. Refer to Note 23 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the/uni00A0Bank also provides various banking services to associated and other related corporations on terms similar to those offered to non-related parties.\n\n## TRANSACTIONS WITH SUBSIDIARIES, SCHWAB, AND SYMCOR/uni00A0INC.\n\nTransactions between the/uni00A0Bank and its subsidiaries meet the definition of related party transactions./uni00A0If these transactions are eliminated on consolidation, they are not disclosed as related party transactions.\n\nTransactions between the/uni00A0Bank, Schwab, and Symcor Inc. (Symcor) also qualify as related party transactions. There were no significant transactions between the/uni00A0Bank, Schwab, and Symcor during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, other than as described in the following sections and in/uni00A0Note 12 of the 2022/uni00A0Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## i) TRANSACTIONS WITH SCHWAB\n\nThe Bank has significant influence over Schwab and accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement in relation to the/uni00A0Bank's equity investment in Schwab, subject to certain conditions, the/uni00A0Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab's Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees. As of October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's designated directors were the/uni00A0Bank's Group President and Chief Executive Officer and/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's Chair of the Board.\n\nA description of significant transactions between the/uni00A0Bank and its affiliates with Schwab is set forth below.\n\n## Insured Deposit Account Agreement\n\nThe Bank is party to the Schwab IDA Agreement which became effective on the completion of the Schwab transaction on October 6, 2020 and has an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Pursuant to the Schwab IDA Agreement, the/uni00A0Bank makes sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services with respect to the Schwab IDA Agreement. The servicing fee under the Schwab IDA Agreement is set at 15 bps per annum on the aggregate average daily balance in the sweep deposit accounts. As at October 31, 2022, deposits under the Schwab IDA Agreement were $174 billion (US$128 billion) (October 31, 2021 - $176 billion (US$142 billion)). Starting July 1, 2021, deposits can be reduced at Schwab's option by up to US$10 billion in a year (subject to certain adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. The Bank paid fees of $1.7 billion during the year ended October 31, 2022 (October/uni00A031,/uni00A02021/uni00A0- $1.6 billion) to Schwab related to sweep deposit accounts. The amount paid by the/uni00A0Bank is based on the average insured deposit balance of $182 billion for the year ended October 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 - $186 billion) and yields based on agreed upon market benchmarks, less the actual interest paid to clients of Schwab.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, amounts receivable from Schwab were $31 million (October 31, 2021 - $26 million). As at October 31, 2022, amounts payable to Schwab were $152 million (October 31, 2021 $195/uni00A0million).\n\nThe Bank and other financial institutions provided Schwab and its subsidiaries with unsecured revolving loan facilities. As at October 31, 2022, there was no loan commitment provided by the Bank to Schwab (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $95 million undrawn).\n\n## ii) TRANSACTIONS WITH SYMCOR\n\nThe Bank has one-third ownership in Symcor, a Canadian provider of business process outsourcing services offering a diverse portfolio of integrated solutions in item processing, statement processing and production, and cash management services. The Bank accounts for Symcor's results using the equity method of accounting. During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank paid $77 million (October/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A0$76 million) for these services. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, the amount payable to Symcor was $12 million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $12/uni00A0million).\n\nThe Bank and two other shareholder banks have also provided a/uni00A0$100/uni00A0million unsecured loan facility to Symcor which was undrawn as/uni00A0at/uni00A0October/uni00A031, 2022, and October/uni00A031, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## GROUP FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nAs a financial institution, the/uni00A0Bank's assets and liabilities are substantially composed of financial instruments. Financial assets of the/uni00A0Bank include, but are not limited to, cash, interest-bearing deposits, securities, loans, derivative instruments and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements; while financial liabilities include, but are not limited to, deposits, obligations related to securities sold short, securitization liabilities, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, derivative instruments, and subordinated debt.\n\nThe Bank uses financial instruments for both trading and non-trading activities. The Bank typically engages in trading activities by the purchase and sale of securities to provide liquidity and meet the needs of clients and, less frequently, by taking trading positions with the objective of earning a profit. Trading financial instruments include, but are not limited to, trading securities, trading deposits, and trading derivatives. Nontrading financial instruments include the majority of the/uni00A0Bank's lending portfolio, non-trading securities, hedging derivatives, and the majority\n\nof/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's financial liabilities. In accordance with accounting standards related to financial instruments, financial assets or liabilities classified as held-for-trading, non-trading FVTPL, designated at FVTPL, FVOCI, and all derivatives are measured at fair value in the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. DSAC, most loans, and other liabilities are carried at/uni00A0amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. For details on how fair values of financial instruments are determined, refer to the 'Accounting Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions' - 'Fair Value Measurement' section of this document. The use of financial instruments allows the/uni00A0Bank to earn profits in trading, interest, and fee income. Financial instruments also create a variety of risks which the/uni00A0Bank manages with its extensive risk management policies and procedures. The key risks include interest rate, credit, liquidity, market, and foreign exchange risks. For a more detailed description on how the/uni00A0Bank manages its risk, refer to/uni00A0the 'Managing Risk' section of this document.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT\n\n## Risk Factors That May/uni00A0Affect Future Results\n\nIn addition to the risks described in the 'Managing Risk' section, there are numerous other risk factors, many of which are beyond the/uni00A0Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, that could cause the/uni00A0Bank's results to differ significantly from the/uni00A0Bank's plans, objectives, and estimates or could impact the/uni00A0Bank's reputation or sustainability of its business model. All forward-looking statements, including those in this MD&A, are, by their very nature, subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific, which may cause the/uni00A0Bank's actual results to differ materially from the plan, objectives, estimates or expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are discussed below and others are noted in the 'Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' section of this document.\n\n## TOP AND EMERGING RISKS\n\nThe Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the/uni00A0Bank and where the attention of senior management is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of/uni00A0their impacts.\n\nRisks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior management and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee and the Board. Specific plans to/uni00A0mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required.\n\n## General Business and Economic Conditions\n\nThe Bank and its customers operate in Canada, the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, in other countries. As a result, the/uni00A0Bank's earnings are significantly affected by the general business and economic conditions in these regions, which could have an adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's results, business, financial condition or liquidity, and could result in changes to the way the/uni00A0Bank operates. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, the decline in economic activity that could lead to\n\na recession, fluctuations in financial markets and related market liquidity, real estate prices, employment levels, consumer spending and debt levels, evolving consumer trends and related changes to business models, business investment, government spending, monetary policy, fiscal policy (including tax policy and rate changes), exchange rates, sovereign debt risks, the strength of the economy, threats of terrorism, civil unrest, natural disasters, extreme weather, reputational risk associated with increased regulatory, public, and media focus, pandemics or other public health emergencies, disruptions to public infrastructure, governmental policy, international trade and political relations.\n\n## Geopolitical Risk\n\nGovernment policy, international trade and political relations across the globe may impact overall market and economic stability, including in the regions where the/uni00A0Bank operates, or where its customers operate. While the nature and extent of risks may vary, they have the potential to disrupt global economic growth, create volatility in financial markets that may affect the/uni00A0Bank's trading and non-trading activities, market liquidity, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodity prices, credit spreads, fiscal policy, and directly and indirectly influence general business and economic conditions in ways that may have an adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank and its customers. Geopolitical risks in 2022 included ongoing global tensions resulting in sanctions and countersanctions and related operational complexities, supply chain disruptions, economic and societal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, being subjected to heightened regulatory focus on climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy, increased likelihood of critical public and private infrastructure and networks to cyber-attacks, the Russia/Ukraine war and the resulting tensions between Russia and other nation states, continuing tensions in the Middle East and Asia, political and economic turmoil, and ongoing protectionism measures due to a decline in global alignment.",

        "page_content": "## Inflation, Rising Rates, and Recession\n\nInflation has reached decade high levels in Canada, the U.S., and many other countries as a result of pandemic-related constrained consumer demand, increased labour costs, the ongoing impact of global supply chain disruptions, the Russia/Ukraine war and other macroeconomic conditions and global tensions. Despite central banks' efforts to manage inflation by increasing interest rates, the rising rates could result in increased loan delinquencies or impairments and higher credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of the/uni00A0Bank's customers and may necessitate further increases in the/uni00A0Bank's provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs, both of which could negatively impact the/uni00A0Bank's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, actual stress levels experienced by the/uni00A0Bank's borrowers may differ from assumptions incorporated in estimates or models used by the/uni00A0Bank. The rising rate environment also increases concerns around the probability of a recession in Canada, the U.S. and other regions where the/uni00A0Bank and its customers operate and continues to impact the macroeconomic and business environment. Such developments could have an adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n\n## Impact of Pandemics, Including the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nPandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease in Canada, the U.S., or worldwide have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's results, business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could result in changes to the way the/uni00A0Bank operates.\n\nWhile many COVID-19 pandemic-related risks are receding and measures to contain the spread of the virus have lifted in many regions, the pandemic continues to have, and new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease could have, an impact on Canadian, U.S., and global economies including contributing to high levels of inflation, rising interest rates (to mitigate inflation), and the resulting threat of recession (which heightens the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to the risks described in/uni00A0the Inflation, Rising Rates, and Recession risk factor referenced above). In/uni00A0addition, public health measures continue to be implemented in certain regions or countries, such as China, and may be reinstated in other areas which could result in the forced closure of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues, increased unemployment and workforce absenteeism necessitated by the imposition of quarantines, physical distancing, travel restrictions, and sheltering-in-place requirements in Canada, the U.S. and other countries, heightened concerns over household debt levels; and reduced customer spending and consumer confidence.\n\nThe measures implemented by governmental and regulatory authorities to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses to stabilize the financial markets, and to support economic growth have been effective to-date in mitigating some effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although such measures have largely ceased, the cost, if any, that implementing these programs has had or will have on fiscal, tax and regulatory policy, and the implications for the/uni00A0Bank, its customers, and the financial services industry has yet to be determined.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created, and new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease may create, operational and compliance risks, including the need to implement and execute new programs and procedures for the/uni00A0Bank's products and services; provide enhanced safety measures for its employees and customers; address the risk and increased incidence of attempted fraudulent activity and cybersecurity threat behaviour; and protect the integrity and functionality of the/uni00A0Bank's systems, networks, and data as the/uni00A0Bank transitioned to a workplace model which includes a larger number of employees working in a hybrid environment. The Bank remains exposed to human capital risks, risks arising from mental wellness concerns for employees due to issues related to health and safety matters, and increased levels of workforce absenteeism with the possible emergence of new variants that are potentially more contagious and/or more vaccine-resistant than current or past COVID-19 variants. Suppliers and other third parties upon which the/uni00A0Bank relies have, and may continue to be exposed to similar and\n\nother risks which in turn impact the/uni00A0Bank's operations. Increased levels of workforce absenteeism and disruption for the/uni00A0Bank and its suppliers and other third parties upon which the/uni00A0Bank relies, may increase operational and compliance risks for the/uni00A0Bank. Increased absenteeism and disruption may also increase the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to the other risks described in the 'Risk Factors and Management' section of this document.\n\nConsumer behaviour changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and may change in the event of new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease. Changes in consumer behaviour has impacted and may continue to impact the macroeconomic and business environment, societal and business norms, and fiscal, tax and regulatory policy. Such developments could have an adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's business operations, the quality and continuity of services provided to customers, the results of operations and financial condition, including making the/uni00A0Bank's longer-term business, balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly. The Bank has, and may continue to experience, increased or different competitive and/or other challenges, including the retention and recruitment of qualified employees. To the extent that the/uni00A0Bank is not able to adapt or compete effectively, it could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\n\nThe Bank may be criticized or face increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, customer disputes, negative publicity, or exposure to litigation (including class actions, or regulatory and government actions and proceedings) as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions, including as a result of the/uni00A0Bank's participation (directly or on behalf of/uni00A0customers) in governmental assistance programs, the/uni00A0Bank's deferral and other types of customer assistance programs, and the impact or effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's health and safety measures on its customers and employees. The Bank has also received formal and informal inquiries from governmental and regulatory agencies regarding its participation in governmental assistance programs. These risks could increase the/uni00A0Bank's operational, legal and compliance costs, expose it to financial judgments and fines, and damage its reputation.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase, and new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infection disease may result in further increases, in certain types of the risks outlined in the 'Risk Factors and Management' section of this document, including the/uni00A0Bank's top and emerging, strategic, credit, market, operational, model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, and reputational risks.\n\n## Executing on Long-Term Strategies, Shorter-Term Key Strategic Priorities, and Acquisitions\n\nThe Bank has a number of strategies and priorities, including those detailed in each segment's 'Business Segment Analysis' section of this document, which may include large scale strategic or regulatory initiatives that are at various stages of development or implementation. Examples include organic growth strategies, new acquisitions (including the closing of the pending acquisitions of First Horizon and Cowen), integration of recently acquired businesses, projects to meet new regulatory requirements, new platforms and technology, and enhancements to existing technology. Risk can be elevated due to the size, scope, velocity, interdependency, and complexity of projects; the limited timeframes to complete the projects; and competing priorities for limited specialized resources.\n\nThe Bank regularly explores opportunities to acquire companies or businesses, directly or indirectly, through the acquisition strategies of its subsidiaries. In respect of acquisitions, the/uni00A0Bank undertakes transaction assessments and due diligence before completing a merger or an acquisition and closely monitors integration activities and performance post acquisition. However, the/uni00A0Bank's ability to successfully complete an acquisition is often subject to regulatory and other approvals, and the/uni00A0Bank cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required approvals will be granted.",

        "page_content": "While there is significant management attention on the governance, oversight, methodology, tools, and resources needed to manage the/uni00A0Bank's strategies and priorities, the/uni00A0Bank's ability to execute on them is dependent on a number of assumptions and factors. These include those set out in the 'Economic Summary and Outlook', 'Key Priorities for 2023', '2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023', 'Operating Environment and Outlook', and 'Managing Risk' sections of this document, as well as disciplined resource and expense management and the/uni00A0Bank's ability to implement (and the costs associated with the implementation of) enterprise-wide programs to comply with new or enhanced regulations or regulator demands, all of which may not be in the/uni00A0Bank's control and are difficult to predict.\n\nThe Bank may not achieve its financial or strategic objectives, including anticipated cost savings or revenue synergies, following acquisition and integration activities. In addition, from time to time, the/uni00A0Bank may invest in companies without taking a controlling position in those companies, which may subject the/uni00A0Bank to the operating and financial risks of those companies', the risk that these companies may make decisions that the/uni00A0Bank does not agree with, and the risk that the/uni00A0Bank may have differing objectives than the companies in which the/uni00A0Bank has interests.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.1% of the outstanding voting and non-voting common shares of Schwab, and the/uni00A0Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab. The value of the/uni00A0Bank's investment in Schwab and its contribution to the/uni00A0Bank's financial results are vulnerable to poor financial performance or other issues at Schwab affecting its business. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank relies on Schwab for its financial results that are included in the/uni00A0Bank's financial statements. Although the/uni00A0Bank has director designation rights to the Schwab board of directors and certain other rights under the Stockholder Agreement with Schwab so long as it holds at least a 5% equity interest in Schwab (and currently has designated two directors to serve on the Schwab board), these rights may not mitigate the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to poor financial performance or other issues at Schwab that may affect the/uni00A0Bank's financial results.\n\nIf any of the/uni00A0Bank's strategies, priorities, or acquisitions and integration activities are not successfully executed, or do not achieve their financial or/uni00A0strategic objectives, there may be an impact on the/uni00A0Bank's operations and financial performance and the/uni00A0Bank's earnings could grow more slowly or decline.\n\n## Technology and Cyber Security Risk\n\nTechnology and cyber security risks for large financial institutions like the/uni00A0Bank have increased in recent years, especially due to heightened geopolitical tensions. In particular, the increased likelihood of attacks on critical infrastructure and to supply chains is due, in part, to the proliferation, sophistication and constant evolution of new technologies and attack methodologies used by sociopolitical entities, organized criminals, malicious insiders or, service providers, nation states, hackers and other internal or external parties. The increased risks are also a factor of the/uni00A0Bank's size and scale of operations, geographic footprint, the complexity of its technology infrastructure, and the/uni00A0Bank's use of internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, such as its continued development of mobile and internet banking platforms as well as opportunistic threats by actors that have accelerated exploitations of new weaknesses, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Bank's technologies, systems and networks, and those of the/uni00A0Bank's customers (including their own devices) and third parties providing services to the/uni00A0Bank, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks, and may be subject to disruption of services, data security or other breaches (including loss or exposure of confidential information, including customer or employee information), identity theft and corporate espionage, or other compromises. The Bank has experienced service disruptions as a result of technology failure at a third party and may be subject to such disruptions in the future due to cyber attacks and/or technology failure. The Bank's use of third-party service providers, which are subject to these potential compromises, increases the/uni00A0Bank's risk of potential attack, breach or disruption as the/uni00A0Bank has less immediate oversight and direct control over their technology infrastructure or information security.\n\nAlthough the/uni00A0Bank has not experienced any material financial losses relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks or data security or other breaches, the/uni00A0Bank may experience material loss or damage in the future including from cyber-attacks such as targeted and automated online attacks on banking systems and applications, supply chain attacks, ransomware attacks, introduction of malicious software, denial of service attacks, malicious insider or service provider exfiltrating data, and phishing attacks, any of which could result in the fraudulent use, disclosure or theft of data or customer or Bank funds, or the disruption of the/uni00A0Bank's operations. Cyber-attacks may include attempts by employees, agents or third-party service providers of the/uni00A0Bank to disrupt operations, access or disclose sensitive information or other data of the/uni00A0Bank, its customers or its employees. In addition, attempts to illicitly or misleadingly induce employees, customers, service providers, or other users of the/uni00A0Bank's systems occur, and will likely continue to occur, in an effort to obtain sensitive information, gain access to the/uni00A0Bank's or its customers' or employees' data or customer or Bank funds, or to disrupt the/uni00A0Bank's operations. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank's customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, which limits the/uni00A0Bank's ability to mitigate certain risks introduced through these personal devices.\n\nThe Bank regularly reviews external events and assesses and enhances its controls and response capabilities as it considers necessary to mitigate against the risk of cyber-attacks or data security or other breaches, but these activities may not mitigate all risks, and the/uni00A0Bank may experience loss or damage arising from such attacks. Cyber and technology-related risks have become increasingly difficult to mitigate in totality mainly because the tactics, techniques, and procedures used change frequently and risks can originate from a wide variety of sources that have also become increasingly sophisticated. As a result, the industry and the/uni00A0Bank are susceptible to experiencing potential loss or damage from these attacks. The adoption of certain technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and process automation call for continued focus and investment to manage the/uni00A0Bank's risks effectively. It is possible that the/uni00A0Bank, or those with whom the/uni00A0Bank does business, have not anticipated or implemented, or may not anticipate or implement effective measures against all such cyber and technology-related risks, particularly because the tactics, techniques, and procedures used change frequently and risks can originate from a wide variety of sources that have also become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, cyber insurance providers are modifying their terms as a result of increased global cyber activity causing pricing uncertainty and coverage term changes across the industry. This has the potential to impact the/uni00A0Bank's cyber insurance purchased to mitigate risk and may limit the amount of coverage available for financial losses. As such, with any cyber-attack, disruption of services, data, security or other breaches (including loss or exposure of confidential information), identity theft, corporate espionage or other compromise of technology or information systems, hardware or related processes, or any significant issues caused by weakness in information technology infrastructure and systems, the/uni00A0Bank may experience, among other things, financial loss; a loss of customers or business opportunities; disruption to operations; misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential, financial or personal information; damage to computers or systems of the/uni00A0Bank and those of its customers and counterparties; violations of applicable privacy and other laws; litigation; regulatory penalties or intervention, remediation, investigation or restoration costs; increased costs to maintain and update the/uni00A0Bank's operational and security systems and infrastructure; and reputational damage. If the/uni00A0Bank were to experience such an incident, it may take a significant amount of time and resources to investigate the incident to obtain full and reliable information necessary to assess the impact. The Bank's owned and operated applications, platforms, networks, processes, products, and services could be subject to failures or disruptions as a result of human error, natural disasters, utility or infrastructure disruptions, pandemics or other public health emergencies, malicious insiders or service providers, cyber-attacks or other criminal or terrorist acts, or noncompliance with regulations, which may impact the/uni00A0Bank's operations. Such adverse effects could limit the/uni00A0Bank's ability to deliver products and services to customers, and/or damage the/uni00A0Bank's reputation, which in turn could lead to financial loss.",

        "page_content": "## Model Risk\n\nThe pandemic and the associated governmental assistance program introduced a heightened level of uncertainty in models and impacted model reliability across various business areas. Although short- and longterm mitigants were identified and executed to help improve resilience of models trained on historical data that may become less relevant under the current environment (e.g., IFRS 9 and stress testing models), new model limitations could arise due to emerging risks, including rising inflation and interest rates and supply chain disruptions. Management's efforts to assess and update models may not adequately or successfully improve the resilience of such models.\n\n## Fraud Activity\n\nFraud risk is the risk associated with acts designed to deceive others, resulting in loss and/or harm to shareholder value, brand, reputation, employee satisfaction and customers. Fraud Risk arises from numerous sources, including potential or existing customers, agents, third parties, contractors, employees and other internal or external parties, including service providers to the/uni00A0Bank's customers that store bank account credentials and harvest data based on customers' web banking information and activities. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers or counterparties, the/uni00A0Bank may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of such customers, counterparties or other external parties, including financial statements and financial information and authentication information. The Bank may also rely on the representations of customers, counterparties, and other external parties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. Misrepresentation of this information potentially exposes the/uni00A0Bank to increased fraud events when transacting with customers or counterparties. In order to authenticate customers, whether through the/uni00A0Bank's phone or digital channels or in its branches and stores, the/uni00A0Bank may also rely on certain authentication methods which could be subject to fraud.\n\nThe Bank has seen an increase in more complex fraud, including cyber fraud and COVID-19 related fraud schemes. However, with the reduction in severity of the COVID-19 environment, fraud attacks against government relief programs have declined and are transitioning back to traditional transaction channels. Attempts to illicitly or misleadingly induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other uses of the/uni00A0Bank's systems will continue, in an effort to obtain sensitive information and gain access to the/uni00A0Bank's or its customers' or employees' data or customer or Bank funds.\n\nLosses attributed to fraud during the 2022 fiscal year increased as higher transactional volumes return, particularly against the/uni00A0Bank's online channels. Despite the/uni00A0Bank's investments in fraud prevention and detection programs, capabilities, measures and defences, they have not, and in the future may not successfully mitigate against all fraudulent activity which could result in financial loss or disruptions in the/uni00A0Bank's businesses. In addition to the risk of material loss (financial loss,/uni00A0misappropriation of confidential information or other assets of the/uni00A0Bank or its customers and counterparties) that could result from fraudulent activity, the/uni00A0Bank could face legal action and customer and market confidence in the/uni00A0Bank could/uni00A0be impacted.\n\n## Third-Party Service Providers\n\nThe Bank recognizes the value of using third parties to support its businesses, as they provide access to leading applications, processes, products and services, specialized expertise, innovation, economies of scale, and operational efficiencies. However, the/uni00A0Bank may become dependent on the provider with respect to continuity, reliability, and security, and their associated processes, people and facilities. As the financial services industry and its supply chain become more complex, the/uni00A0need for resilient, robust, holistic, and sophisticated controls, and ongoing oversight increases.\n\nThe Bank also recognizes that the applications, platforms, networks, processes, products, and services of its providers could be subject to failures or disruptions impacting the delivery of services or products to the/uni00A0Bank. These failures or disruptions could be as a result of human error, natural disasters, utility or infrastructure disruptions, pandemics or other public health emergencies, malicious insiders or service providers, cyber-attacks or other criminal or terrorist acts, or non-compliance with regulations. Such adverse effects could limit the/uni00A0Bank's ability to deliver products and services to customers, lead to disruptions in the/uni00A0Bank's businesses, expose the/uni00A0Bank to legal and regulatory risk, including those outlined under the headings 'Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Risk' and 'Legal Proceedings', and/or damage the/uni00A0Bank's reputation, which in turn could result in an adverse impact to the/uni00A0Bank's operations, earnings or financial condition.\n\n## Introduction of New and Changes to Current Laws and/uni00A0Regulations\n\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated. The Bank's operations, profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by the introduction of new laws and regulations, amendments to, or changes in interpretation or application of current laws and regulations, issuance of judicial decisions, and changes in enforcement pace or activities. These adverse effects could also result from the fiscal, economic, and monetary policies of various central banks, regulatory agencies and governments in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, and changes in the interpretation or implementation of those policies. Such adverse effects may include incurring additional costs and devoting additional resources to address initial and ongoing compliance; limiting the types or nature of products and services the/uni00A0Bank can provide and fees it can charge; unfavourably impacting the pricing and delivery of products and services the/uni00A0Bank provides; increasing the ability of new and existing competitors to compete on the basis of pricing, products and services (including, in jurisdictions outside Canada, the favouring of certain domestic institutions); and increasing risks associated with potential noncompliance. In addition to the adverse impacts described above, the/uni00A0Bank's failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in sanctions, financial penalties, and changes including restrictions on offering certain products or services or on operating in certain jurisdictions, that could adversely impact its earnings, operations and reputation.\n\nAnti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and economic sanctions/uni00A0requirements continue to be a high priority globally, with an increasing pace of regulatory change and evolving industry standards and/uni00A0regulator expectations.\n\nThe global data and privacy landscape is dynamic and regulatory expectations continue to evolve. New and amended legislation is anticipated in various jurisdictions in which the/uni00A0Bank does business.\n\nCanadian, U.S. and global regulators have been increasingly focused on conduct and operational resilience matters and risks, and heightened expectations generally from regulators could lead to investigations, remediation requirements, and higher compliance costs. While the/uni00A0Bank takes numerous steps to continue to strengthen its conduct programs and its operational resilience, and prevent and detect outcomes which could potentially harm customers, colleagues or the integrity of the markets, such outcomes may not always be prevented or detected.\n\nRegulators have increased their focus on ESG matters, including the impact of climate change, financial and economic inclusion and disclosure regarding such matters, with significant new legislation and amended legislation anticipated in some of the jurisdictions in which the/uni00A0Bank does business.\n\nIn addition, there may be changes in interpretation or application of current laws and regulations to incorporate ESG matters in ways that were not previously anticipated.\n\nDespite the/uni00A0Bank's monitoring and evaluation of the potential impact of rules, proposals, consent orders and regulatory guidance, unanticipated new regulations applicable to the/uni00A0Bank may be introduced by governments and regulators around the world and the issuance of judicial decisions may result in unanticipated consequences to the/uni00A0Bank.",

        "page_content": "## Canada\n\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators has passed a number of regulations relating to over-the-counter derivatives reform, including Trade Reporting and Mandatory Clearing and has proposed others, including Business Conduct and Registration. The Bank continues to take steps to implement the regulations already in effect and is monitoring other regulatory initiatives, all of which, when implemented, could result in increased compliance costs, and compliance with these standards may impact the/uni00A0Bank's businesses, operations and results.\n\nIn Canada, there are a number of government and regulatory initiatives underway that could impact financial institutions, including initiatives with respect to payments evolution and modernization, open banking, consumer protection, protection of customer data, technology and cyber security, dealing with vulnerable persons, and anti-money laundering. For example, OSFI released a guideline related to technology and cyber risk management, which will come into effect in 2024, and will require the/uni00A0Bank to assess its governance and risk management framework, technology operations and resilience, and cyber-security strategies and frameworks, and make any necessary changes to mitigate technology and cyber risks in compliance with the guideline, all of which could result in increased compliance costs and impact the/uni00A0Bank's organizational plans, policies, processes and standards.\n\nThe Government of Canada's bail-in regime, which became effective in September 2018, was implemented through regulations published under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (the 'CDIC Act') and the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) , providing the final details of conversion and issuance regimes for bail-in instruments issued by D-SIBs including the/uni00A0Bank (collectively, the Bail-in Regulations). Further amendments were introduced to the CDIC Act in 2021 through Bill C-30 that would support and clarify the scope of the cross-border enforceability of the stay provisions applicable to eligible financial contracts as well as clarify how investors, creditors and other participants may be compensated as a result of actions taken by financial sector authorities to sell, wind-down or restore to viability a failing bank, among other things. The bail-in regime could adversely affect the/uni00A0Bank's cost of funding.\n\n## United States\n\nThe 2018 U.S. Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (Reform Act) included modifications to aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DoddFrank), including stress testing. In addition, the applicable U.S. Federal regulatory agencies have adopted regulatory amendments to some of these requirements. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that implemented the Reform Act's changes to the application of enhanced prudential standards with respect to U.S. and non-U.S. banking organizations (the 'Tailoring Rule') based on the risk profile of the organization. The Bank has incurred, and will continue to incur, operational, capital, liquidity, and compliance costs resulting from these standards. In addition, as a result of the/uni00A0Bank's designation as a G-SIB by the FSB, the/uni00A0Bank's U.S. operations will be subject to certain additional long-term debt and 'total loss-absorbing capacity' capital requirements, effective in 2023.\n\nThe current U.S. regulatory environment for banking organizations may be further impacted by additional legislative or regulatory developments, including resulting from changes in U.S. executive administration, congressional leadership and/or agency leadership, and regulators focusing on potential racial discrimination and economic inequity, including fair lending. The ultimate consequences of these developments and their impact on the/uni00A0Bank remain uncertain and it remains unclear whether any other legislative or regulatory proposals relating to these requirements will be enacted or adopted.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn Europe, there remain a number of uncertainties in connection with the future of the United Kingdom - European Union relationship, and reforms implemented through the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the review of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and accompanying Regulation could result in higher operational and system costs and potential changes in the types of products and services the/uni00A0Bank can offer to customers in the region.\n\n## Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Risk\n\nThe Bank and its businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by a number of different regulators and self-regulatory organizations around the world. Regulatory change and changes in regulator expectations occur in all jurisdictions in which the/uni00A0Bank operates. Governments and regulators around the world have demonstrated an increased focus on conduct risk; consumer protection; data control, use and security; capital and liquidity management; internal control frameworks; and money laundering, terrorist financing and economic sanctions risks and threats. Some of the/uni00A0Bank's regulators have the discretion to impose additional standards or guidance regarding the/uni00A0Bank's risk, capital and liquidity management, or other matters within their regulatory scope, and in some cases the/uni00A0Bank may be prohibited by law from publicly disclosing such additional standards or guidance. There is heightened scrutiny by regulators globally on the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on customers, as well as on the/uni00A0Bank's operations and its management and oversight of risks associated with these matters. In addition, these risks continue to rapidly evolve, as a result of new or emerging threats, including geopolitical and those associated with use of new, emerging and interrelated technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, models and decision-making tools.\n\nThe Bank monitors and evaluates the potential impact of applicable regulatory developments (including enacted and proposed rules, standards, and regulatory guidance). However, while the/uni00A0Bank devotes substantial compliance, legal, and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with these developments by their respective effective dates, and also to the consideration of other governmental and regulator expectations, it is possible that: (i) the/uni00A0Bank may not be able to accurately predict the impact of regulatory developments, or the interpretation or focus of enforcement actions taken by governments, regulators and courts, (ii)/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank may not be able to develop or enhance the platforms, technology, or operational procedures and frameworks necessary to comply with, or adapt to, such rules or expectations in advance of their effective dates; or (iii) regulators and other parties could challenge the/uni00A0Bank's compliance. This could require the/uni00A0Bank to take further actions or incur more costs than expected and may expose the/uni00A0Bank to litigation, enforcement and reputational risk. Regulatory change will continue to increase the/uni00A0Bank's compliance and operational risks and costs. In addition, if governments or regulators take formal enforcement action against the/uni00A0Bank, the/uni00A0Bank's operations, business strategies and product and service offerings may be adversely impacted, therefore impacting financial results.\n\nAlso, it may be determined that the/uni00A0Bank has not adequately, completely or timely addressed regulatory developments or enforcement actions to which it is subject, in a manner which meets governmental or regulator expectations. The Bank has been subject to regulatory enforcement proceedings and has entered into settlement arrangements with regulators and self-regulatory organizations, and the/uni00A0Bank may continue to face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation. In addition, public notifications of enforcement actions are becoming more prevalent which could negatively impact the/uni00A0Bank's reputation.\n\nThe Bank may incur greater than expected costs associated with enhancing its compliance, or may incur fines, penalties or judgments not in its favour associated with non-compliance, all of which could also lead to negative impacts on the/uni00A0Bank's financial performance, operational changes including restrictions on offering certain products or services or on operating in certain jurisdictions, and its reputation.",

        "page_content": "## Level of Competition, Shifts in Consumer Attitudes, and Disruptive Technology\n\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is impacted by the level of competition. Customer retention and acquisition can be influenced by many factors, including the/uni00A0Bank's reputation as well as the pricing, market differentiation, and overall customer experience of the/uni00A0Bank's products and services.\n\nEnhanced competition from incumbents and new entrants may impact the/uni00A0Bank's pricing of products and services and may cause it to lose revenue and/or market share. Increased competition requires the/uni00A0Bank to make additional short and long-term investments to remain competitive and continue delivering differentiated value to its customers, which may increase expenses. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank operates in environments where laws and regulations that apply to it may not universally apply to its current and emerging competitors, which could include the domestic institutions in jurisdictions outside of Canada or the U.S., or non-traditional providers (such as Fintech or big technology competitors) of financial products and services. Non-depository or non-financial institutions are often able to offer products and services that were traditionally banking products and compete with banks in offering digital financial solutions (primarily mobile or web-based services), without facing the same regulatory requirements or oversight. These competitors may also operate at much lower costs relative to revenue or balances than traditional banks. These third parties can seek to acquire customer relationships, react quickly to changes in consumer attitudes, and disintermediate customers from their primary financial institution, which can also increase fraud and privacy risks for customers and financial institutions in general. The nature of disruption is/uni00A0such that it can be difficult to anticipate and/or respond to adequately or quickly, representing inherent risks to certain Bank businesses, including payments. As such, this type of competition could also adversely impact the/uni00A0Bank's earnings.\n\nThe Bank is advancing its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, to help further inform the/uni00A0Bank's business decisions and risk management practices as well as improve customer experiences and efficiency of business operations. AI may not appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or exposures.\n\nThe Bank is also looking at emerging trends, some accelerated by the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, that may disrupt traditional interfaces, interaction preferences, or customer expectations. The Bank considers various options to accelerate innovation, including making strategic investments in innovative companies, exploring partnership opportunities, and experimenting with new technologies and concepts internally, but these investments and activities may not be successful. Legislative or regulatory action relating to such new technologies could emerge and continue to evolve, potentially increasing compliance costs and risks.\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk (including Climate Risk)\n\nAs a financial institution, the/uni00A0Bank is subject to environmental and social/uni00A0(E&S) risk.\n\nEnvironmental risk is the risk of financial loss, reputational damage or other harm resulting from environmental factors, including climate change and other environmental degradation (e.g., loss of biodiversity, deforestation, desertification and drought, land and water degradation and air pollution).\n\nClimate risk is the risk of reputational damage and/or financial loss arising from materialized credit, market, operational or other risks resulting from the physical and transition risks of climate change to the/uni00A0Bank, its clients or the communities the/uni00A0Bank operates in. This includes physical risks arising from the consequences of a changing climate, including acute physical risks stemming from extreme weather events happening with increasing severity and frequency (e.g., wildfires and floods) and chronic physical risks stemming from longer-term, progressive shifts in climatic and environmental conditions (e.g., rising sea levels and global warming). Transition risks arise from the process of shifting to a lowcarbon economy, influenced by new and emerging climate-related public policies and regulations, technologies, stakeholder expectations and legal/uni00A0developments.\n\nSocial risk is the risk of loss, reputational damage or other harm resulting from social factors, including human rights (e.g., discrimination including racial inequity, Indigenous Peoples' rights, modern slavery, and human trafficking), the social impacts of climate change (e.g., poverty, economic and physical displacement) and the health and well-being of employees (e.g., inclusion and diversity, pay equity, mental health, physical well-being, and workplace safety). Organizations, including the/uni00A0Bank, are under increasing scrutiny to address social and financial inequalities among racialized and other marginalized groups and are subject to new rules and regulations such as the Fair Access to Banking Services, Capital and Credit rules in the U.S.\n\nE&S risks may have financial and reputational and other implications for both the/uni00A0Bank and its stakeholders (including its customers, suppliers, and shareholders). These risks may arise from the/uni00A0Bank's operations, investments, business activities or products. They may also arise from the/uni00A0Bank's actual or perceived actions, or inaction, in relation to climate change and other E&S issues, its progress against its E&S commitments, or its disclosures on these matters. These risks could also result from E&S matters impacting the/uni00A0Bank's stakeholders. The Bank's participation in external E&S-related organizations or commitments may exacerbate these risks and subject the/uni00A0Bank to increased scrutiny from its stakeholders. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank may be subject to legal and regulatory risks relating to E&S matters, including regulatory orders, fines, and enforcement actions; financial supervisory capital adequacy requirements; and legal action by shareholders or other stakeholders, including the risks described in the 'Other Risk Factors - Legal Proceedings' section.\n\nThe Bank monitors and assesses legal, policy, regulatory, economic, technological and stakeholder developments regarding E&S matters, including the transition to net zero, and how those developments may affect its E&S metrics and targets. Accordingly, the/uni00A0Bank may make adjustments to its E&S metrics or targets to reflect these developments. In/uni00A0addition, there could be changes to the E&S methodologies or standards used by regulators, the financial sector, industry groups or associations that the/uni00A0Bank participates in or belongs to, or that the/uni00A0Bank or its clients use to measure and report on their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Any such changes could result in TD amending or restating its GHG emissions baselines, calculated GHG emissions or GHG emission targets, and may result in the/uni00A0Bank withdrawing from or modifying its membership in certain groups or associations.",

        "page_content": "## OTHER RISK FACTORS Legal Proceedings\n\nGiven the highly regulated and consumer-facing nature of the financial services industry, the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to significant regulatory, quasiregulatory and self-regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings related to its business and operations. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank and its subsidiaries are from time to time named as defendants or are otherwise involved in various class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties related to its businesses and operations. Actions currently pending against the/uni00A0Bank, or in which the/uni00A0Bank is otherwise involved, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgements, injunctions, business improvement orders, limitations or prohibitions from engaging in business activities, or other results adverse to the/uni00A0Bank, which could materially affect the/uni00A0Bank's business, financial condition and operations, and/or cause serious reputational harm to the/uni00A0Bank, which could also affect the/uni00A0Bank's future business prospects. Moreover, some claims asserted against the/uni00A0Bank may be highly complex and include novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate, in some instances, until late in the proceedings, which may last several years. Although the/uni00A0Bank establishes reserves for these matters according to accounting requirements, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be material and may be substantially different from the amounts accrued. Furthermore, the/uni00A0Bank may not establish reserves for matters where the outcome is uncertain. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the/uni00A0Bank and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and they may pursue regulatory settlements, criminal proceedings or other enforcement actions against the/uni00A0Bank in the future. For additional information relating to the/uni00A0Bank's material legal proceedings, refer to Note/uni00A027 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain Key Talent\n\nThe Bank's future performance is dependent on the availability of qualified talent and the/uni00A0Bank's ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent. The Bank's management understands that the competition for talent continues to increase across geographies, industries, and emerging capabilities across a number of sectors including financial services. This competition has intensified and is expected to continue as a result of shifts in employee preferences and what they value, tight labour market conditions, inflationary pressures and remote roles providing opportunities across geographic boundaries. This could result in increased attrition particularly in areas where core professional and specialized skills are required. Annually, the/uni00A0Bank undertakes a talent review process to assess critical capability requirements for all areas of the business. Through this process, an assessment of current executive leadership, technical and core capabilities, as well as talent development opportunities is completed against both near term and future business needs. The outcomes from the process inform plans at both the enterprise and business level to retain, develop, or acquire the talent which are then actioned throughout the course of the year. Although it is the goal of the/uni00A0Bank's management resource policies and practices to attract, develop, and retain key talent employed by the/uni00A0Bank or an entity acquired by the/uni00A0Bank, the/uni00A0Bank may not be able to do so, and these actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against attrition.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Rates, Interest Rates, Credit Spreads, and/uni00A0Equity Prices\n\nForeign exchange rate, interest rate, credit spread, and equity price movements in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions in which the/uni00A0Bank does business impact the/uni00A0Bank's financial position and its future earnings. Changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the global foreign exchange rates may also affect the earnings of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's small business, commercial, and corporate customers. A/uni00A0change in the level of\n\ninterest rates affects the interest spread between the/uni00A0Bank's deposits and other liabilities, and loans, and as a result, impacts the/uni00A0Bank's net interest income. In particular, rising interest rates would increase the/uni00A0Bank's interest income but could also have adverse impacts on the/uni00A0Bank's cost of funding for loans and may also result in the risks outlined under the heading 'Inflation, Rising Rates and Recession'. A/uni00A0change in the level of credit spreads affects the relative valuation of assets and liabilities, and as a result, impacts the/uni00A0Bank's earnings. A change in equity prices impacts the/uni00A0Bank's financial position and its future earnings, due to unhedged positions the/uni00A0Bank holds in tradeable equity securities. The trading and non-trading market risk frameworks and policies manage the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite for known market risk, but such activities may not be sufficient to mitigate against such market risk, and the/uni00A0Bank remains exposed to unforeseen market risk.\n\n## Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Transition\n\nVarious interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be 'benchmarks' (including IBOR benchmarks such as London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a result of the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to alternative reference rates (ARR) have been continuing in various jurisdictions. The transition to ARRs may result in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the/uni00A0Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry.\n\nThe Bank has significant contractual rights, obligations and exposures referenced to IBOR benchmarks as such discontinuance of, or changes to, benchmark rates could adversely affect the/uni00A0Bank's business and results of operations. The Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight, to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks.\n\nIn addition to operational challenges, market risks also arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates resulting in differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require alternative hedging strategies, or affect the/uni00A0Bank's capital and liquidity planning and management. Additionally, any adverse impacts on the value of and return on existing instruments and contracts for the/uni00A0Bank's clients may present an increased risk of litigation, regulatory intervention, and possible reputational/uni00A0damage.\n\n## Accounting Policies and Methods Used by the/uni00A0Bank\n\nThe Bank's accounting policies and estimates are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the/uni00A0Bank's policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements, and its reputation. The Bank has established procedures designed to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates and adopting new accounting standards occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Significant accounting policies as well as current and future changes in accounting policies are described in Note 2 and Note 4, respectively, and significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions are described in Note 3 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The Bank's goal is to earn a/uni00A0stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while/uni00A0putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its strategic objectives.\n\nThe Bank's Enterprise Risk Framework (ERF) reinforces the/uni00A0Bank's risk culture, which emphasizes transparency and accountability, and supports a common understanding among stakeholders of how the/uni00A0Bank manages risk. The ERF addresses: (1) how the/uni00A0Bank defines the types of risk it is exposed to; (2) how the/uni00A0Bank determines the risks arising from the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and operations; (3) risk management governance and organization; and (4) how the/uni00A0Bank manages risk through processes that\n\nidentify and assess, measure, control, monitor, and report risk. The Bank's risk management resources and processes are designed to both challenge and enable all its businesses to understand the risks they face and to manage them within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## RISKS INVOLVED IN TD'S BUSINESSES\n\nThe Bank's Risk Inventory sets out the/uni00A0Bank's major risk categories and related subcategories to which the/uni00A0Bank's businesses and operations could be exposed. The Risk Inventory facilitates consistent risk identification and is the starting point in developing risk management strategies and processes. The Bank's major risk categories are: Strategic Risk; Credit Risk; Market Risk; Operational Risk; Model Risk; Insurance Risk; Liquidity Risk; Capital Adequacy Risk; Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk; and Reputational Risk.\n\n## Major Risk Categories\n\nModel Risk\n\nStrategic Risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe Bank's RAS is the primary means used to communicate how the/uni00A0Bank views risk and determines the type and amount of risk it is willing to take to deliver on its strategy and to enhance shareholder value. In defining its risk appetite, the/uni00A0Bank takes into account its vision, purpose, strategy, shared commitments, and capacity to bear risk under both normal and recessionary conditions. The core risk principles for the/uni00A0Bank's RAS are as follows:\n\nThe Bank takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks:\n\n- 1. Fit the business strategy, and can be understood and managed.\n- 2. Do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not 'bet the/uni00A0Bank' on any single acquisition, business, or product.\n- 3. Do not risk harming the TD brand.\n\nThe Bank's Risk Appetite Governance Framework (RAGF) describes the assumptions, responsibilities, and processes established to define, maintain, and govern TD's risk appetite. The Bank considers current operating conditions and the impact of emerging risks in developing and applying its risk appetite. Adherence to enterprise risk appetite is managed and monitored across the/uni00A0Bank and is informed by the RAGF and a broad collection of principles, policies, processes, and tools.\n\nThe Bank's/uni00A0RAS describes, by major risk category, the/uni00A0Bank's risk principles and establishes both qualitative and quantitative measures, thresholds, and limits, as appropriate. RAS measures consider both normal and stress scenarios and include those that can be monitored at the enterprise level and cascaded to the segments.\n\nRisk Management is responsible for establishing practices and processes to formulate, monitor, and report on the/uni00A0Bank's RAS measures. The Risk Management function also monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these practices and processes, as well as the RAS measures. Compliance with RAS principles and measures is reported regularly to senior management, the Board, and the Risk Committee of the Board (Risk Committee); other measures are tracked on an ongoing basis by management, and escalated to senior management and the Board, as required. Risk Management regularly assesses management's performance against the/uni00A0Bank's RAS measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapital Adequacy Risk\n\nLegal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nRisk culture is one of the attributes that is integral to TD's overall organizational culture. It forms part of and is guided by the TD Culture Framework. The central oversight for culture at TD is led by Human Resources (HR) in partnership with Risk Management and Compliance. The Risk Committee engages with the Group Head and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who leads a diverse team of risk professionals to drive a proactive risk culture.\n\nThe Bank's risk culture starts with the 'tone at the top' set by the Board, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the Senior Executive Team (SET), and is supported by the/uni00A0Bank's vision, purpose, and shared commitments. These governing objectives describe the behaviours that the/uni00A0Bank seeks to foster among its employees, in building a culture where the only risks taken are those that can be understood and managed. The Bank's risk culture embraces accountability and continuous learning (especially from past experiences), and encourages open communication and transparency on all aspects of risk taking. The Bank's employees are encouraged to challenge and escalate when they believe the/uni00A0Bank is operating outside of/uni00A0its risk culture or appetite.\n\nEthical behaviour is a key component of the/uni00A0Bank's risk culture. The Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics guides employees and directors to make decisions that meet the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and ethical behaviour. Every Bank employee and director is expected and required to assess business decisions and actions on behalf of the organization in light of whether it is right, legal, and fair.\n\nThe Bank's desired risk culture is reinforced by linking compensation to management's performance against the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite and shared behaviours. Performance against risk appetite is a key consideration in determining compensation for executives, including adjustments to incentive awards both at the time of award and again at maturity for deferred compensation. An annual consolidated assessment of management's performance against the RAS is prepared by Risk Management, reviewed by the Risk Committee, and is used by the HR Committee as a key input into compensation decisions. All executives are individually assessed against objectives that include consideration of risk and control behaviours. This comprehensive approach allows the/uni00A0Bank to consider whether the actions of executive management resulted in risk and control events within their area of responsibility.",

        "page_content": "In addition, governance, risk, and oversight functions operate independently from segments, supported by an organizational structure that provides objective oversight and independent challenge. Governance, risk, and oversight function heads, including the CRO, have unfettered access to respective Board committees to raise risk, compliance, and other issues. Lastly, awareness and communication of the/uni00A0Bank's RAS and the ERF take place across the organization through enterprise risk communication programs, employee orientation and training, and participation in internal risk management conferences. These activities further strengthen the/uni00A0Bank's risk culture by increasing the knowledge and/uni00A0understanding of the/uni00A0Bank's expectations for risk taking.\n\n## WHO MANAGES RISK\n\nThe Bank's risk governance structure emphasizes and balances independent oversight with clear ownership for risk control within each segment. Under the/uni00A0Bank's approach to risk governance, a 'three lines of defence' model is employed, in which the first line of defence is the risk owner, the second line provides risk oversight, and the third line is internal audit.\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\nThe Bank's risk governance model includes a senior management committee structure that is designed to support transparent risk reporting and discussions. The Bank's overall risk and control oversight is provided by the Board and its committees. The CEO and SET determine the/uni00A0Bank's long-term direction which is then carried out by segments within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite. Risk Management, headed by the CRO, sets enterprise risk strategy and policy and provides independent oversight to support a comprehensive and proactive risk management approach. The CRO, who is/uni00A0also a member of the SET, has unfettered access to the Risk Committee.\n\nThe Bank has a subsidiary governance framework to support its overall risk governance structure, including boards of directors, and committees for various subsidiary entities where appropriate. Within the U.S. Retail business segment, risk and control oversight is provided by a separate and distinct Board of Directors which includes a fully independent Board Risk Committee and Board Audit Committee. The U.S. Chief Risk Officer (U.S./uni00A0CRO) has unfettered access to the U.S. Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe following section provides an overview of the key roles and responsibilities involved in risk management. The Bank's risk governance structure is illustrated in the following figure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The Board of Directors\n\nThe Board oversees the/uni00A0Bank's strategic direction, the implementation of an effective risk culture and the internal control framework across the enterprise. It accomplishes its risk management mandate both directly and indirectly through its four committees: the Audit, Risk, Corporate Governance, and HR Committees. The Board reviews and approves the/uni00A0Bank's/uni00A0RAS and related measures annually, and reviews the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile and performance relative to its risk appetite measures and principles.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees financial reporting, the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, and the activities of Internal Audit, Finance, Compliance and the Regulatory Compliance Management Program, and the Anti-Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing/Economic Sanctions/Anti-Bribery and AntiCorruption Program.\n\n## The Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending TD's RAS for approval by the Board annually. The Risk Committee oversees the management of TD's risk profile and performance relative to its risk appetite. In support of this oversight, the Committee reviews and approves significant enterprise-wide risk management frameworks and policies that are designed to help manage the/uni00A0Bank's major risk exposures, and monitors the management of risks, issues and trends.\n\n## The Human Resources Committee\n\nThe HR Committee, in addition to its other responsibilities, oversees the management of the/uni00A0Bank's culture. It also satisfies itself that HR risks are appropriately identified, assessed, and managed in a manner consistent with the risk programs within the/uni00A0Bank, and with the sustainable achievement of the/uni00A0Bank's business objectives.\n\n## The Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee, in addition to its other responsibilities, develops, and where appropriate, recommends to the Board for approval corporate governance principles, including the/uni00A0Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics, aimed at fostering a healthy governance culture at the/uni00A0Bank, and also acts as the conduct review committee for the/uni00A0Bank, including providing oversight of conduct risk. In addition, the committee has oversight of the/uni00A0Bank's alignment with its purpose and its strategy, performance and reporting on corporate responsibility for E&S matters, and oversees the establishment and maintenance of policies in respect of the/uni00A0Bank's compliance with the consumer protection provisions of the Financial Consumer Protection Framework.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer and Senior Executive Team\n\nThe CEO and the SET develop and recommend to the Board the/uni00A0Bank's long-term strategic direction and also develop and recommend for Board approval TD's RAS. The SET members set the 'tone at the top' and manage risk in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's RAS while considering the impact of current and emerging risks on the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and risk profile. This accountability includes identifying, understanding and communicating significant risks to the Risk Committee.\n\n## Executive Committees\n\nThe CEO, in consultation with the CRO establishes the/uni00A0Bank's executive committee structure. These committees are chaired by SET members and meet regularly to oversee governance, risk, and control activities and to review and monitor risk strategies and associated risk activities and practices.\n\nThe ERMC, chaired by the CEO, oversees the management of major enterprise governance, risk, and control activities and promotes an integrated and effective risk management culture. The following executive committees have been established to manage specific major risks based on the nature of the risk and related business activity:\n\n- \u00b7 ALCO - chaired by the SET member responsible for TBSM, the ALCO oversees directly and through its standing subcommittees (the Enterprise Capital Committee and Global Liquidity and Funding Forum (GLF)), the management of the/uni00A0Bank's consolidated non-trading market risk and each of its consolidated liquidity, funding, investments, and capital positions.\n- \u00b7 OROC - chaired by the CRO, the OROC oversees the identification, monitoring, and control of key risks within the/uni00A0Bank's operational risk/uni00A0profile.\n\n- \u00b7 DC - chaired by the CFO, the DC oversees that appropriate controls and procedures are in place and operating to permit timely, accurate, balanced, and compliant disclosure.\n- \u00b7 ERRC - chaired by the CRO, the ERRC oversees the management of reputational risk within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite, provides a forum for discussion, review, and escalation for non-traditional risks, and acts as a decisioning body in cases where urgent risk assessment and decisions are required for select high-risk cross-segment/enterprise changes and where decision rights run across more than one group.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe Risk Management function, headed by the CRO, provides independent oversight of enterprise-wide risk management, risk governance, and control, including the setting of risk strategy and policy to manage risk in alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite and business strategy. Risk Management's primary objective is to support a comprehensive and proactive approach to risk management that promotes a strong risk culture. Risk Management works with the segments and other oversight functions to establish policies, standards, and limits that align with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite and monitors and reports on current and emerging risks and compliance with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite. The CRO leads and directs a diverse team of risk management professionals organized to oversee risks arising from each of the/uni00A0Bank's major risk categories. There is an established process in place for the identification and assessment of top and emerging risks. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank has clear procedures governing when and how risk events and issues are communicated to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n\n## Business and Corporate Segments\n\nEach business and corporate segment has a dedicated risk management function that reports directly to a senior risk executive who, in turn, reports to the CRO. This structure supports an appropriate level of independent oversight while emphasizing accountability for risk within the segment. Business and corporate management is responsible for setting the segmentlevel risk appetite and measures, which are reviewed and challenged by Risk Management, endorsed by the ERMC, and approved by the CEO, to align with the/uni00A0Bank's RAS and manage risk within approved risk limits.\n\nThe corporate segment includes service and control groups (e.g., Platforms and Technology; Transformation, Enablement and Customer Experience; Human Resources and Finance) that, like business segments, are responsible for assessing risk, designing and implementing controls and monitoring and reporting their ongoing effectiveness to safeguard TD/uni00A0from exceeding its risk appetite.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Bank's Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance to the Board regarding the reliability and effectiveness of key elements of the/uni00A0Bank's risk management, internal control, and governance processes.\n\n## Compliance\n\nCompliance is responsible for fostering a culture of integrity, ethics, and compliance throughout the/uni00A0Bank; delivering independent risk management and oversight of regulatory compliance throughout the/uni00A0Bank. The department is accountable for providing reliable and objective guidance and reporting to senior management and the Board on the state of regulatory compliance, controls and outcomes; material events of non-compliance based on independent monitoring and testing conducted (and on other data sources and indicators); and advising whether the Regulatory Compliance Management (RCM) controls are sufficiently robust to achieve compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements enterprise-wide.\n\n## Global Anti-Money Laundering\n\nGAML is responsible for the oversight of TD's regulatory compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Anti-Terrorist Financing, Economic Sanctions, and Anti-Bribery/Anti-Corruption regulatory compliance and broader prudential risk management across the/uni00A0Bank in alignment with enterprise AML policies so that the money laundering, terrorist financing, economic sanctions, and bribery and corruption risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.",

The Bank's objective is to establish and maintain integrated risk identification and assessment processes that enhance the understanding of risk interdependencies, consider how risk types intersect, and support the identification of emerging risks. To that end, the/uni00A0Bank's Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing (EWST) program enables senior management, the Board, and its committees to identify and articulate enterprise-wide risks and understand potential vulnerabilities for the/uni00A0Bank.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Measurement\n\nThe ability to quantify risks is a key component of the/uni00A0Bank's risk management process. The Bank's risk measurement process aligns with regulatory requirements such as capital adequacy, leverage ratios, liquidity measures, stress testing, and maximum credit exposure guidelines established by its regulators. Additionally, the/uni00A0Bank has a process in place to quantify risks to provide accurate and timely measurements of the risks it assumes.\n\nIn quantifying risk, the/uni00A0Bank uses various risk measurement methodologies, including Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis, scenario analysis, stress testing, and limits. Other examples of risk measurements include credit exposures, PCL, peer comparisons, trending analysis, liquidity coverage, leverage ratios, capital adequacy metrics, and operational risk event notification metrics. The Bank also requires segments and oversight functions to assess key risks and internal controls through a structured Risk and Control Self-Assessment program. Internal and external risk events are monitored to assess whether the/uni00A0Bank's internal controls are effective. This allows the/uni00A0Bank to identify, escalate, and monitor significant risk issues as needed.\n\n## Risk Control\n\nThe Bank's risk control processes are established and communicated through the Risk Committee and management approved policies, and associated management approved procedures, control limits, and delegated authorities which reflect its risk appetite and risk tolerances.\n\nThe Bank's approach to risk control also includes risk and capital assessments to appropriately capture key risks in its measurement and management of capital adequacy. This involves the review, challenge, and endorsement by senior management committees of the/uni00A0Bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Programs (ICAAP) and related economic capital practices. The Bank's performance is measured based on the allocation of risk-based capital to businesses and the cost charged against that capital.\n\n## Risk Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe Bank monitors and reports on risk levels on a regular basis against its risk appetite and Risk Management reports on its risk monitoring activities to senior management, the Board and its Committees, and appropriate executive and management committees. Complementing regular risk monitoring and reporting, ad/uni00A0hoc risk reporting is provided to senior management, the Risk Committee, and the Board, as appropriate, for new and emerging risks or any significant changes to the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile. The Bank is developing methodologies and approaches for climate scenario analysis through participation in industry-wide working groups and is working to embed the assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities into relevant Bank processes.\n\n## Stress Testing\n\nStress testing is an integral component of the/uni00A0Bank's risk management framework and serves as a key component of the/uni00A0Bank's capital, strategic and financial planning processes. Stress testing at the/uni00A0Bank comprises an annual enterprise-wide stress test featuring a range of scenarios, prescribed regulatory stress tests in multiple jurisdictions, and various ongoing and ad hoc stress tests and analysis. The results of these stress tests and analysis enable management to assess the impact of geopolitical events and changes to economic and other market factors on/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's financial condition and assist in the determination of capital and liquidity adequacy and targets, risk appetite and other limits. These exercises enable the identification and quantification of vulnerabilities, the monitoring of changes in risk profile relative to risk appetite limits, and evaluation of business plans.\n\nThe Bank utilizes a combination of quantitative modelling and qualitative approaches to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment on the/uni00A0Bank's income statement, balance sheet, and capital and liquidity position under hypothetical stress situations. Stress testing engages senior management across the lines of business, Finance, TBSM, Economics, and Risk Management. Stress test results are reviewed, challenged and approved by senior management and executive oversight committees. The Bank's Risk Committee also reviews, challenges, and discusses the results. The results are submitted, disclosed, or shared with regulators as required or requested.\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing\n\nThe Bank conducts an annual EWST as part of a comprehensive capital and liquidity planning, strategic, and financial exercise that is a key component of the/uni00A0Bank's ICAAP framework. The EWST results are considered in establishing the/uni00A0Bank's capital and liquidity targets and risk appetite limits, evaluating the/uni00A0Bank's strategies and business plan, and identifying actions that senior management could take to manage the impact of stress events. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank conducts ad hoc stress tests and analysis for assessing the impact of events deemed to be potentially material or of concern in support of senior management's response to an uncertain or rapidly changing operating environment.\n\nThe program is subject to a well-defined governance structure that facilitates executive oversight and engagement throughout the organization. The Bank's EWST program involves the development, execution and assessment of stress scenarios with varying features and degrees of severity on the balance sheet, income statement, capital, liquidity, and leverage. It enables management to identify and assess enterprise-wide risks and understand potential vulnerabilities, and changes to the risk profile of the/uni00A0Bank. Stress scenarios are developed with consideration of the/uni00A0Bank's key business activities, exposures, concentrations and vulnerabilities. The scenarios cover a wide variety of risk factors meaningful to the/uni00A0Bank's risk profiles in North America and globally including changes to unemployment, gross domestic product, home prices, and interest rates.\n\nFor the 2022 EWST program, the/uni00A0Bank developed and assessed scenarios that explored emerging risks such as inflation risk, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, as well as physical climate risk. The stress testing scenarios included, a plausible typical recession scenario calibrated to historical recessions in Canada and the U.S., a low probability and highly severe stagflation scenario targeting TD-specific risks and vulnerabilities in support of the ICAAP, and a plausible high interest rate and inflation scenario. Ad hoc scenarios and supplemental analysis explored the evolution of various geopolitical related events, expected market transitions, as well as physical climate risk events supporting senior management in assessing key risks.\n\n## Other Stress Tests and Analysis\n\nOngoing stress testing and scenario analyses within specific risk types, such as market risk, liquidity risk, retail and wholesale credit risk, operational risk, and insurance risk, supplement and support our enterprise-wide analyses. Results from these risk-specific programs are used in a variety of decision-making processes including risk limit setting, portfolio composition evaluation, risk appetite articulation and business strategy implementation. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank conducts ad hoc stress tests and analysis for targeted portfolios, to evaluate potential vulnerabilities to specific changes in economic and market conditions.\n\nStress tests are also conducted on certain legal entities and jurisdictions, in line with prescribed regulatory requirements. The Bank's U.S.-based operating bank subsidiaries' capital planning process includes activities and results from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Dodd-Frank Act stress testing (DFAST) requirements. The Bank's U.S. holding company capital planning process includes the stress testing activities and results from the Federal Reserve Board's capital plan rule and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) requirements. In addition, certain Bank subsidiaries in Singapore, Ireland, and the United Kingdom conduct stress testing exercises as part of their respective ICAAP. The Bank undertakes other internal and regulatory based stress tests including liquidity and market risk, which are detailed in the respective/uni00A0sections.\n\nThe Bank also conducts scenario and sensitivity analysis as part of the Recovery and Resolution Planning program to assess potential mitigating actions and contingency planning strategies, as required.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic Risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of sub-optimal outcomes (including financial loss or reputational damage) arising from the/uni00A0Bank's choice of strategies, the improper implementation of chosen strategies, the inability to implement chosen strategies, an inadequate response to disruption to the/uni00A0Bank's strategies or the taking of tail risk (i.e., low probability events that can result in extremely large quantifiable losses). Strategies include current operations and merger and acquisition activities.\n\n## WHO MANAGES STRATEGIC RISK\n\nThe CEO manages Strategic Risk supported by the members of the SET and the ERMC. The CEO, together with the SET, defines the overall strategy, in consultation with, and subject to approval by the Board. The Enterprise Strategy group, under the leadership of the Senior Executive Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Treasury is charged with developing the/uni00A0Bank's overall long-term strategy and shorter-term strategic priorities with input and support from senior executives across the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nEach member of the SET is responsible for establishing and managing long-term strategy and shorter-term priorities for their areas of responsibility (business segment or corporate function) and ensuring that such strategies are aligned with the/uni00A0Bank's overall long-term strategy and short-term strategic priorities, and within the enterprise risk appetite. Each SET member is also accountable to the CEO for identifying, assessing, measuring, controlling, monitoring, and reporting on the effectiveness and risks of their business strategies.\n\nThe CEO, SET members, and other senior executives report to the Board on the implementation of the/uni00A0Bank's strategies, identifying related risks, and explaining how those risks are managed.\n\nThe ERMC oversees the identification and monitoring of significant and emerging risks related to the/uni00A0Bank's strategies so that mitigating actions are taken where appropriate.\n\nThe shaded areas of this MD&A represent a discussion on risk management policies and procedures relating to credit, market, and liquidity risks as required under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which permits these specific disclosures to be included in the MD&A. Therefore, the shaded areas which include Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Liquidity Risk, form an integral part of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss if a borrower or counterparty in a transaction fails to meet its agreed payment obligations.\n\nCredit risk is one of the most significant and pervasive risks in banking. Every loan, extension of credit, or transaction that involves the transfer of payments between the/uni00A0Bank and other parties or financial institutions exposes the/uni00A0Bank to some degree of credit risk.\n\nThe Bank's primary objective is to be methodical in its credit risk assessment so that the/uni00A0Bank can understand, select, and manage its exposures to reduce significant fluctuations in earnings.\n\nThe Bank's strategy is to include central oversight of credit risk in each business, and reinforce a culture of transparency, accountability, independence, and balance.\n\n## WHO MANAGES CREDIT RISK\n\nThe responsibility for credit risk management is enterprise-wide. To reinforce ownership of credit risk, credit risk control functions are integrated into each business, but also report to Risk Management.\n\nEach business segment's credit risk control unit is responsible for its credit decisions and must comply with established policies, exposure guidelines, credit approval limits, and policy/limit exception procedures. It must also adhere to established enterprise-wide standards of credit assessment and obtain Risk Management's approval for credit decisions beyond its discretionary authority.\n\nRisk Management is accountable for oversight of credit risk by developing policies that govern and control portfolio risks, and approval of/uni00A0product-specific policies, as required.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES STRATEGIC RISK\n\nThe Bank's enterprise-wide strategies and operating performance, and those of significant business segments and corporate functions, are assessed regularly by the CEO and the members of the SET through an integrated financial and strategic planning process, as well as operating results reviews.\n\nThe Bank's RAS establishes strategic risk limits at the enterprise and business segment-level. Limits include qualitative and quantitative assessments and are established to monitor and control business concentrations, strategic disruption, and E&S risks.\n\nThe Bank's annual integrated planning process establishes plans at the enterprise, segment, and strategic business line-levels (subsets of business segments). The plans include key operating trends, long-term strategy, shorter-term strategies, target metrics, key risks and mitigants, ESG considerations, and alignment with enterprise strategy and risk appetite.\n\nOperating results are reviewed on a periodic basis during the year to monitor segment-level performance against the integrated financial and strategic plan. These reviews include an evaluation of the long-term strategy and short-term strategic priorities of each business segment, including the operating environment, competitive position, performance assessment, initiatives for strategy execution and key business risks. The frequency of the operating results reviews depends on the risk profile and size of the business segment or corporate function.\n\nThe Bank's strategic risk, and adherence to its risk appetite, is reviewed/uni00A0by the ERMC in the normal course, as well as by the Board. Additionally, material acquisitions are assessed for their fit with the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and risk appetite in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's Due Diligence Policy. This assessment is reviewed by the SET and Board as part of the decision process.\n\nThe Risk Committee oversees the management of credit risk and annually approves certain significant credit risk policies.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES CREDIT RISK\n\nThe Bank's Credit Risk Management Framework outlines the internal risk and control structure to manage credit risk and includes risk appetite, policies, processes, limits and governance. The Credit Risk Management Framework is maintained by Risk Management and supports alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite for credit risk.\n\nCredit risk policies and credit decision-making strategies, as well as the/uni00A0discretionary limits of officers throughout the/uni00A0Bank for extending lines of credit are centrally approved by Risk Management, and the Board where applicable.\n\nLimits are established to monitor and control country, industry, product, geographic, and group exposure risks in the portfolios in accordance with enterprise-wide policies.\n\nIn the/uni00A0Bank's Retail businesses, the/uni00A0Bank uses established underwriting guidelines (which include collateral and loan-to-value constraints) along with approved scoring techniques and standards in extending, monitoring, and reporting personal credit. Credit scores and decision strategies are used in the origination and ongoing management of new and existing retail credit exposures. Scoring models and decision strategies utilize a combination of borrower attributes, including, but not limited to, employment status, existing loan exposure and performance, and size of total bank relationship, as well as external data such as credit bureau information, to determine the amount of credit the/uni00A0Bank is prepared to extend to retail customers and to estimate future credit performance. Established policies and procedures are in place to govern the use, and monitor and assess the performance of scoring models and decision strategies to align with expected performance results. Retail credit exposures approved within the regional credit centres are subject to ongoing Retail Risk Management review to assess the effectiveness of credit decisions and risk controls, as well as identify emerging or systemic issues and trends. Material policy exceptions are tracked and reported and larger dollar exposures and material exceptions to policy are escalated to Retail Risk Management.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's Commercial Banking and Wholesale Banking businesses use credit risk models and policies to establish borrower and facility risk ratings (BRR and FRR), quantify and monitor the level of risk, and facilitate the associated risk management. Risk ratings are also used to determine the amount of credit exposure the/uni00A0Bank is willing to extend to a particular borrower. Management processes are used to monitor country, industry, and borrower or counterparty risk ratings, which include daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual review requirements for credit exposures. The key parameters used in the/uni00A0Bank's credit risk models are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nUnanticipated economic or political changes in a foreign country could affect cross-border payments for goods and services, loans, dividends, and trade-related finance, as well as repatriation of the/uni00A0Bank's capital in that country. The Bank currently has credit exposure in a number of countries, with the majority of the exposure in North America. The Bank measures country risk using approved risk rating models and qualitative factors that are also used to establish country exposure limits covering all aspects of credit exposure across all businesses. Country risk ratings are managed on an ongoing basis and are subject to a detailed review at least annually.\n\nAs part of the/uni00A0Bank's credit risk strategy, the/uni00A0Bank sets limits on the amount of credit it is prepared to extend to specific industry sectors. The Bank monitors its concentration to any given industry to provide for a diversified loan portfolio and to reduce the risk of undue concentration. The Bank manages this risk using limits based on an internal risk rating score that combines TD's industry risk rating model and industry analysis, and regularly reviews industry risk ratings to assess whether internal ratings properly reflect the risk of the industry. The Bank assigns a maximum exposure limit or a concentration limit to each major industry segment which is a percentage of its total wholesale and commercial private sector exposure.\n\nThe Bank may also set limits on the amount of credit it is prepared to extend to a particular entity or group of entities, also referred to as 'entity risk'. All entity risk is approved by the appropriate decision-making authority using limits based on the entity's BRR. This exposure is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nTo determine the potential loss that could be incurred under a range of adverse scenarios, the/uni00A0Bank subjects its credit portfolios to stress tests. Stress tests assess vulnerability of the portfolios to the effects of severe but/uni00A0plausible situations, such as an economic downturn or a material market disruption.\n\n## The Basel Framework\n\nThe objective of the Basel Framework is to improve the consistency of/uni00A0capital requirements internationally and make required regulatory capital more risk-sensitive. The Basel Framework sets out several options/uni00A0which represent increasingly more risk-sensitive approaches for/uni00A0calculating credit, market, and operational RWA.\n\n## Credit Risk and the Basel Framework\n\nThe Bank uses the Basel AIRB Approach for credit risk for all material/uni00A0portfolios.\n\nTo continue to qualify using the AIRB Approach for credit risk, the/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0must meet the ongoing conditions and requirements established/uni00A0by OSFI and the Basel Framework. The Bank regularly assesses/uni00A0its compliance with these requirements.\n\n## Credit Risk Exposures Subject to the AIRB Approach\n\nBanks that adopt the AIRB Approach to credit risk must report credit risk exposures by counterparty type, each having different underlying risk characteristics. These counterparty types may differ from the presentation in the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank's credit risk exposures are divided into two main portfolios, retail and non-retail.\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nUnder the AIRB Approach, credit risk is measured using the following risk parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD) - the likelihood that the borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments within a one-year time horizon.\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD) - the amount of loss the/uni00A0Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default (EAD).\n- \u00b7 EAD - the total amount the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to at the time of default.\n\nBy applying these risk parameters, the/uni00A0Bank can measure and monitor its credit risk to verify that it remains within pre-determined thresholds.\n\n## Retail Exposures\n\nIn the retail portfolio, including individuals and small businesses, the/uni00A0Bank manages exposures on a pooled basis, using predictive credit scoring techniques. There are three sub-types of retail exposures: residential secured (for example, mortgages and home equity lines of credit), qualifying revolving retail (for example, credit cards, unsecured lines of credit, and overdraft protection products), and other retail (for example, personal loans, including secured automobile loans, student lines of credit, and small business banking credit products).\n\nThe Bank calculates RWA for its retail exposures using the AIRB Approach. All retail PD, LGD, and EAD parameter models are based on the internal default and loss performance history for each of the three retail exposure sub-types.\n\nAccount-level PD, LGD, and EAD models are built for each product portfolio and calibrated based on the observed account-level default and loss performance for the portfolio.\n\nConsistent with the AIRB Approach, the/uni00A0Bank defines default for exposures as delinquency of 90 days or more for the majority of retail credit portfolios. LGD estimates used in the RWA calculations reflect economic losses, such as, direct and indirect costs as well as any appropriate discount to account for time between default and ultimate recovery. EAD estimates reflect the historically observed utilization of credit limits at default. PD, LGD, and EAD models are calibrated using established statistical methods, such as logistic and linear regression techniques. Predictive attributes in the models may include account attributes, such as loan size, interest rate, and collateral, where applicable; an account's previous history and current status; an account's age on book; a customer's credit bureau attributes; a customer's other holdings with the/uni00A0Bank; and macroeconomic inputs, such as unemployment rate. For secured products such as residential mortgages, property characteristics, loan-to-value ratios, and a customer's equity in the property, play a significant role in PD as well as in LGD models.\n\nAll risk parameter estimates are updated on a quarterly basis based on the refreshed model inputs. Parameter estimation is fully automated based on approved formulas and is not subject to manual overrides.\n\nExposures are then assigned to one of nine pre-defined PD segments based on their estimated long-run average one-year PD.\n\nThe predictive power of the/uni00A0Bank's retail credit models is assessed against the most recently available one-year default and loss performance on a quarterly basis. All models are also subject to a comprehensive independent validation as outlined in the 'Model Risk Management' section of this disclosure.\n\nLong-run PD estimates are generated by including key economic indicators, such as interest rates and unemployment rates, and using their long-run average over the credit cycle to estimate PD.\n\nLGD estimates are required to reflect a downturn scenario. Downturn LGD estimates are generated by using macroeconomic inputs, such as changes in housing prices and unemployment rates expected in an appropriately severe downturn scenario.\n\nFor unsecured products, downturn LGD estimates reflect the observed lower recoveries for exposures defaulted during the 2008 to 2009 recession. For products secured by residential real estate, such as mortgages and home equity lines of credit, downturn LGD reflects the potential impact of a severe housing downturn. EAD estimates similarly reflect a downturn scenario.",

The Bank has categorized non-retail credit risk exposures according to the following Basel counterparty types: corporate, including wholesale and commercial customers, sovereign, and bank. Under the AIRB Approach, CMHC-insured mortgages are considered sovereign risk and are therefore classified as non-retail.\n\nThe Bank evaluates credit risk for non-retail exposures by using both a BRR and FRR. The Bank uses this system for all corporate, sovereign, and bank exposures. The Bank determines the risk ratings using industry and sector-specific credit risk models that are based on internal historical data. In Canada, for both the wholesale and commercial lending portfolios, credit risk models are calibrated based on internal data beginning in 1994. In the U.S., credit risk models are calibrated based on internal data beginning in 2007. All borrowers and facilities are assigned an internal risk rating that must be reviewed at least once each year. External data such as rating agency default rates or loss databases are used to validate the parameters.\n\nInternal risk ratings (BRR and FRR) are key to portfolio monitoring and management, and are used to set exposure limits and loan pricing. Internal risk ratings are also used in the calculation of regulatory capital, economic capital, and allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Borrower Risk Rating and PD\n\nEach borrower is assigned a BRR that reflects the PD of the borrower using proprietary models and expert judgment. In assessing borrower risk, the/uni00A0Bank reviews the borrower's competitive position, financial performance, economic, and industry trends, management quality, and access to funds. Under the AIRB Approach, borrowers are grouped into BRR grades that have similar PD. Use of projections for model implied risk ratings is not permitted and BRRs may not incorporate a projected reversal, stabilization of negative trends, or the acceleration of existing positive trends. Historic financial results can however be sensitized to account for events that have occurred, or are about to occur, such as additional debt incurred by a borrower since the date of the last set of financial statements. In conducting an assessment of the BRR, all relevant and material information must be taken into account and the information being used must be current. Quantitative rating models are used to rank the expected through-the-cycle PD, and these models are segmented into categories based on industry and borrower size. The quantitative model output can be modified in some cases by expert judgment, as prescribed within the/uni00A0Bank's credit policies.\n\nTo calibrate PDs for each BRR band, the/uni00A0Bank computes yearly transition matrices based on annual cohorts and then estimates the average annual PD for each BRR. The PD is set at the average estimation level plus an appropriate adjustment to cover statistical and model uncertainty. The calibration process for PD is a through-the-cycle approach. TD's 21-point BRR scale broadly aligns to external ratings as follows:\n\n| Description          | Rating Category           | Standard & Poor's                | Moody's Investor Services        |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Investment grade     | 0 to 1C 2A to 2C 3A to 3C | AAA to AA- A+ to A- BBB+ to BBB- | Aaa to Aa3 A1 to A3 Baa1 to Baa3 |\n| Non-investment grade | 4A to 4C 5A to 5C         | BB+ to BB- B+ to B-              | Ba1 to Ba3 B1 to B3              |\n| Watch and classified | 6 to 8                    | CCC+ to CC and below             | Caa1 to Ca and below             |\n| Impaired/default     | 9A to 9B                  | Default                          | Default                          |\n\n## Facility Risk Rating and LGD\n\nThe FRR maps to LGD and takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, and loan structure.\n\nDifferent FRR models are used based on industry and obligor size. Data considered in the calibration of the LGD model includes variables such as collateral coverage, debt structure, and borrower enterprise value. Average LGD and the statistical uncertainty of LGD are estimated for each FRR grade. In some FRR models, lack of historical data requires the model to output a rank-ordering which is then mapped through expert judgment to/uni00A0the quantitative LGD scale.\n\nThe AIRB Approach stipulates the use of downturn LGD, where the downturn period, as determined by internal and/or external experience, suggests higher than average loss rates or lower than average recovery. To reflect this, calibrated LGDs take into account both the statistical estimation uncertainty and the higher than average LGDs experienced during downturn periods.\n\n## Exposure at Default\n\nThe Bank calculates non-retail EAD by first measuring the drawn amount of a facility and then adding a potential increased utilization at default from the undrawn portion, if any. Usage Given Default (UGD) is measured as the percentage of Committed Undrawn exposure that would be expected to be drawn by a borrower defaulting in the next year, in addition to the amount that already has been drawn by the borrower. In/uni00A0the absence of credit mitigation effects or other details, the EAD is set at the drawn amount plus (UGD x Committed Undrawn), where UGD is a/uni00A0percentage between 0% and 100%.\n\nBRR and drawn ratio up to one-year prior to default are predictors for UGD. Consequently, the UGD estimates are calibrated by BRR and drawn ratio, the latter representing the ratio of the drawn to authorized amounts.\n\nHistorical UGD experience is studied for any downturn impacts, similar to the LGD downturn analysis. The Bank has not found downturn UGD to be significantly different from average UGD, therefore the UGDs are set at the average calibrated level, by drawn ratio and/or BRR, plus an appropriate adjustment for statistical and model uncertainty.\n\n## Credit Risk Exposures Subject to the Standardized Approach (SA)\n\nCurrently SA to credit risk is used on exempted portfolios which are either immaterial or expected to wind down. Under SA, the assets are multiplied by risk weights prescribed by OSFI to determine RWA. These risk weights are assigned according to certain factors including counterparty type, product type, and the nature/extent of credit risk mitigation. The Bank uses external credit ratings, including Moody's and S&P to determine the appropriate risk weight for its exposures to sovereigns (governments, central banks, and certain public sector entities) and banks (regulated deposit-taking institutions, securities firms, and certain public sector/uni00A0entities).",

        "page_content": "The Bank applies the following risk weights to on-balance sheet exposures under SA:\n\n| Sovereign   | 0% 1   |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Bank        | 20% 1  |\n| Corporate   | 100%   |\n\nLower risk weights apply where approved credit risk mitigants exist. Nonretail loans that are more than 90 days past due receive a risk weight of 150%. For off-balance sheet exposures, specified credit conversion factors are used to convert the notional amount of the exposure into a credit equivalent amount.\n\n## Derivative Exposures\n\nCredit risk on derivative financial instruments, also known as counterparty credit risk, is the risk of a financial loss occurring as a result of the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation to the/uni00A0Bank. Derivativerelated credit risks are subject to the same credit approval standards that the/uni00A0Bank uses for assessing loans. These standards include evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties, measuring and monitoring exposures, including wrong-way risk exposures, and managing the size, diversification, and maturity structure of the portfolios.\n\nThe Bank uses various qualitative and quantitative methods to measure and manage counterparty credit risk. These include statistical methods to measure the current and future potential risk, as well as ongoing stress testing to identify and quantify exposure under a range of adverse scenarios. The Bank establishes various limits to manage business volumes and concentrations. Risk Management independently measures and monitors counterparty credit risk relative to established credit policies and limits. As part of the credit risk monitoring process, management periodically reviews all exposures, including exposures resulting from derivative financial instruments to higher risk counterparties, and to assess the valuation of underlying financial instruments and the impact evolving market conditions may have on the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nTo reduce credit risk exposure, the/uni00A0Bank employs mitigation strategies that include master netting agreements, collateral pledging, central clearing houses and other credit risk mitigation techniques. Master netting agreements allow the/uni00A0Bank to offset and arrive at a net obligation amount, whereas collateral agreements allow the/uni00A0Bank to secure the/uni00A0Bank's exposure. By taking the opposite position to each trade, central clearing houses also reduce bilateral credit risk.\n\nThere are two types of wrong-way risk exposures, namely general and specific. General wrong-way risk arises when the PD of the counterparties moves in the same direction as a given market risk factor. Specific wrongway risk arises when the exposure to a particular counterparty moves in the same direction as the PD of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions entered into with that counterparty. These exposures require specific approval within the credit approval process. The Bank measures and manages specific wrong-way risk exposures in the same manner as direct loan obligations and controls them by way of approved credit facility limits.\n\nThe Bank uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk to/uni00A0calculate the EAD amount, which is defined by OSFI as a multiple of the/uni00A0summation of replacement cost and potential future exposure, to estimate the risk and determine regulatory capital requirements for derivative exposures.\n\n## Validation of the Credit Risk Rating System\n\nCredit risk rating systems and methodologies are independently validated on a regular basis to verify that they remain accurate predictors of risk. The/uni00A0validation process includes the following considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk parameter estimates - PDs, LGDs, and EADs are reviewed and updated against actual loss experience to verify that estimates continue to be reasonable predictors of potential loss.\n- \u00b7 Model performance - Estimates continue to be discriminatory, stable, and predictive.\n- \u00b7 Data quality - Data used in the risk rating system is accurate, appropriate, and sufficient.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions - Key assumptions underlying the development of the model remain valid for the current portfolio and environment.\n\nRisk Management verifies that the credit risk rating system complies with the/uni00A0Bank's Model Risk Policy. At least annually, the Risk Committee is informed of the performance of the credit risk rating system. The Risk Committee must approve any material changes to the/uni00A0Bank's credit risk rating system.\n\n## Credit Risk Mitigation\n\nThe techniques the/uni00A0Bank uses to reduce or mitigate credit risk include written policies and procedures to value and manage financial and non-financial security (collateral) and to review and negotiate netting agreements. The amount and type of collateral, and other credit risk mitigation techniques required, are based on the/uni00A0Bank's own assessment of the borrower's or counterparty's credit quality and capacity to pay.\n\nIn the Retail and Commercial banking businesses, security for loans is primarily non-financial and includes residential real estate, real estate under development, commercial real estate, automobiles, and other business assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. In the Wholesale Banking business, a large portion of loans are to investment grade borrowers where no security is pledged. Non-investment grade borrowers typically pledge business assets in the same manner as commercial borrowers. Common standards across the/uni00A0Bank are used to value collateral, determine frequency of recalculation, and to document, register, perfect, and monitor collateral.\n\nThe Bank also uses collateral, master netting agreements and central clearing houses to mitigate derivative counterparty exposure. Security for derivative exposures is primarily financial and includes cash and negotiable securities issued by highly rated governments and investment grade issuers. This approach includes pre-defined discounts and procedures for/uni00A0the receipt, safekeeping, and release of pledged securities.\n\nIn all but exceptional situations, the/uni00A0Bank secures collateral by taking possession and controlling it in a jurisdiction where it can legally enforce its collateral rights. In exceptional situations and when demanded by the/uni00A0Bank's counterparty, the/uni00A0Bank holds or pledges collateral with an acceptable third-party custodian. The Bank documents all such third-party arrangements with industry standard agreements.\n\nOccasionally, the/uni00A0Bank may take guarantees to reduce the risk in credit exposures. For credit risk exposures subject to the AIRB approach, the/uni00A0Bank only recognizes irrevocable guarantees for Commercial Banking and Wholesale Banking credit exposures that are provided by entities with a better risk rating than that of the borrower or counterparty to the/uni00A0transaction.\n\nThe Bank makes use of credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk. The credit, legal, and other risks associated with these transactions are controlled through well-established procedures. The Bank's policy is to enter into these transactions with investment grade financial institutions and transact on a collateralized basis. Credit risk to these counterparties is managed through the same approval, limit, and monitoring processes the/uni00A0Bank uses for all counterparties for which it has credit exposure.\n\nThe Bank uses appraisals and automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values when adjudicating loans collateralized by residential real property. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate or validate the market value of residential real property using market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of these tools is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. The Bank has specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when they may be used, and processes to periodically validate AVMs including obtaining third-party appraisals.",

Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance\n\nsheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, nontrading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions.

Under the simple risk weight method, a 300% risk weight is applied to equity holdings that are publicly traded and a 400% risk weight is applied to all other equity holdings. Equity exposures to sovereigns and holdings made under legislated programs continue to follow the appropriate OSFI prescribed risk weights of 0%, 20% or 100%.\n\n## Securitization Exposures\n\nEffective November 1, 2018, the/uni00A0Bank applies risk weights to all securitization exposures under the revised securitization framework published by OSFI. The revised securitization framework includes a hierarchy of approaches to determine capital treatment, and transactions that meet the simple, transparent, and comparable requirements that are/uni00A0eligible for preferential capital treatment.\n\nThe Bank uses Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) for qualified exposures. Under SEC-IRBA, risk weights are determined using a loss coverage model that quantifies and monitors the level of risk. The SECIRBA also considers credit enhancements available for loss protection.\n\nFor externally rated exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA, the/uni00A0Bank uses an External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA). Risk weights are assigned to exposures using external ratings by external rating agencies, including Moody's and S&P. The SEC-ERBA also takes into account additional factors, including the type of the rating (long-term or short-term), maturity, and the seniority of the position.\n\nFor exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA or SEC-ERBA, and are held by an ABCP issuing conduit, the/uni00A0Bank uses the Internal Assessment Approach (IAA).\n\nUnder the IAA, the/uni00A0Bank considers all relevant risk factors in assessing the credit quality of these exposures, including those published by the Moody's and S&P rating agencies. The Bank also uses loss coverage models and policies to quantify and monitor the level of risk, and facilitate its management. The Bank's IAA process includes an assessment of the extent by which the enhancement available for loss protection provides coverage of expected losses. The levels of stressed coverage the/uni00A0Bank requires for each internal risk rating are consistent with the rating agencies' published stressed factor requirements for their equivalent external ratings by asset class. Under the IAA, exposures are multiplied by OSFI prescribed risk weights to calculate RWA for capital purposes.\n\nFor exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA or the IAA, the/uni00A0Bank uses the SA (SEC-SA). Under SEC-SA, the primary factors that determine the risk weights include the asset class of the underlying loans, the seniority of the position, the level of credit enhancements, and historical delinquency rates.\n\nIrrespective of the approach being used to determine the risk weights, all exposures are assigned an internal risk rating based on the/uni00A0Bank's assessment, which must be reviewed at least annually. The ratings scale/uni00A0TD/uni00A0uses corresponds to the long-term ratings scales used by the rating agencies.\n\nThe Bank's internal rating process is subject to all of the key elements and principles of the/uni00A0Bank's risk governance structure, and is managed in/uni00A0the same way as outlined in this 'Credit Risk' section.\n\nThe Bank uses the results of the internal rating in all aspects of its credit risk management, including performance tracking, control mechanisms, and management reporting.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nTrading Market Risk is the risk of loss in financial instruments held in trading positions due to adverse movements in market factors. These market factors include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and their respective volatilities.\n\nNon-Trading Market Risk is the risk of loss on the balance sheet or volatility in earnings from non-trading activities such as asset-liability management or investments, due to adverse movements in market factors. These market factors are predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and equity prices.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk in its trading and investment portfolios, as well as through its non-trading activities. The Bank is an/uni00A0active participant in the market through its trading and investment portfolios, seeking to realize returns for the/uni00A0Bank through careful management of its positions and inventories. In the/uni00A0Bank's non-trading activities, it is exposed to market risk through the everyday banking transactions that the/uni00A0Bank executes with its customers.\n\nThe Bank complied with the Basel III market risk requirements as at/uni00A0October/uni00A031, 2022, using the Internal Models Approach.",

        "page_content": "## MARKET RISK IN TRADING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe overall objective of the/uni00A0Bank's trading businesses is to provide wholesale banking services, including facilitation and liquidity, to clients of the/uni00A0Bank. The Bank must take on risk in order to provide effective service in markets where its clients trade. In particular, the/uni00A0Bank needs to hold inventory, act as principal to facilitate client transactions, and underwrite new issues. The Bank also trades in order to have in-depth knowledge of market conditions to provide the most efficient and effective pricing and service to clients, while balancing the risks inherent in its dealing activities.\n\n## WHO MANAGES MARKET RISK IN TRADING ACTIVITIES\n\nPrimary responsibility for managing market risk in trading activities lies with Wholesale Banking, with oversight from Market Risk Control within Risk Management. The Market Risk Control Committee meets regularly to/uni00A0conduct a review of the market risk profile, trading results of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's trading businesses as well as changes to market risk policies. The committee is chaired by the Vice President, Head of Market/uni00A0Risk, and includes Wholesale Banking senior management.\n\nThere were no significant reclassifications between trading and nontrading books during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES MARKET RISK IN TRADING ACTIVITIES\n\nMarket risk plays a key part in the assessment of any trading business strategy. The Bank launches new trading initiatives or expands existing ones only if the risk has been thoroughly assessed, and is judged to be within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite and business expertise, and if the appropriate infrastructure is in place to monitor, control, and manage the risk. The Trading Market Risk Framework outlines the management of trading market risk and incorporates risk appetite, risk governance structure, risk identification, measurement, and control. The Trading Market Risk Framework is maintained by Risk Management and supports alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite for trading market risk.\n\n## Trading Limits\n\nThe Bank sets trading limits that are consistent with the approved business strategy for each business and its tolerance for the associated market risk, aligned to its market risk appetite. In setting limits, the/uni00A0Bank takes into account market volatility, market liquidity, organizational experience, and business strategy. Limits are prescribed at the Wholesale Banking level in aggregate, as well as at more granular levels.\n\nThe core market risk limits are based on the key risk drivers in the business and includes notional, credit spread, yield curve shift, price, and volatility limits.\n\nAnother primary measure of trading limits is VaR, which the/uni00A0Bank uses to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time.\n\nAt the end of each day, risk positions are compared with risk limits, and any excesses are reported in accordance with established market risk policies and procedures.\n\n## Calculating VaR\n\nThe Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the/uni00A0Bank's trading positions.\n\nGMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes.\n\nIDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period.\n\nThe following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the/uni00A0Bank's market risk capital trading books. For the year ending October 31, 2022, there were 37 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 86% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the year did not exceed VaR on any trading day.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "VaR is a valuable risk measure but it should be used in the context of its limitations, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 VaR uses historical data to estimate future events, which limits its forecasting abilities;\n- \u00b7 it does not provide information on losses beyond the selected confidence level; and\n- \u00b7 it assumes that all positions can be liquidated during the holding period used for VaR calculation.\n\nThe Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. In 2022, the/uni00A0Bank implemented infrastructure enhancements to adapt to the market wide Benchmark Rate Reforms.\n\nTo mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the/uni00A0Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), Stress Testing, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors.\n\n## Calculating Stressed VaR (SVaR)\n\nIn addition to VaR, the/uni00A0Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices\n\n## T A B L E 4 5 | PORTFOLIO MARKET RISK MEASURES\n\ncould have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the/uni00A0Bank uses a selected year of stressed market conditions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. The appropriate historical one-year period to use for Stressed VaR is determined on a quarterly basis. Stressed VaR is a part of/uni00A0regulatory capital requirements.\n\n## Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge\n\nThe IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the/uni00A0Bank's exposures. The Bank applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is/uni00A0based on a 'constant level of risk' assumption, which requires banks to/uni00A0assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe following table presents the end of year, average, high, and low usage of TD's portfolio metrics.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)             | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                            | As at       | Average     | High        | Low         | As at       | Average     | High        | Low         |\n| Interest rate risk                         | $  15.3     | $  21.2     | $  41.1     | $  9.8      | $  11.9     | $  15.7     | $  33.5     | $  6.8      |\n| Credit spread risk                         | 35.6        | 23.0        | 41.0        | 8.0         | 9.0         | 14.7        | 37.2        | 5.4         |\n| Equity risk                                | 10.6        | 12.8        | 24.3        | 7.8         | 9.2         | 9.5         | 14.1        | 6.0         |\n| Foreign exchange risk                      | 4.8         | 2.4         | 7.5         | 0.6         | 1.8         | 1.9         | 5.3         | 0.4         |\n| Commodity risk                             | 12.1        | 5.8         | 13.4        | 2.9         | 4.7         | 4.7         | 9.4         | 1.9         |\n| Idiosyncratic debt specific risk           | 60.0        | 36.8        | 60.9        | 17.8        | 19.4        | 26.2        | 41.9        | 16.5        |\n| Diversification effect 1                   | (69.4)      | (56.8)      | n/m 2       | n/m         | (32.9)      | (42.8)      | n/m         | n/m         |\n| Total Value-at-Risk (one-day)              | 69.0        | 45.2        | 76.0        | 21.8        | 23.1        | 29.9        | 44.7        | 20.6        |\n| Stressed Value-at-Risk (one-day)           | 74.0        | 77.5        | 100.0       | 55.7        | 63.9        | 39.5        | 63.9        | 28.5        |\n| Incremental Risk Capital Charge (one-year) | 176.4       | 260.3       | 418.8       | 149.4       | 338.3       | 349.5       | 424.3       | 265.1       |\n\n- 1 The aggregate VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the different risk types due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.\n- 2 Not meaningful. It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types.\n\nMarkets experienced volatility across all asset classes in 2022 due to concerns surrounding ongoing geopolitical tensions, elevated inflationary pressure and interest rate hikes. Key factors impacting VaR models during the period were credit spread widening and new scenario shocks incorporating market volatility rolling into the most recent 259-day trading window. As a result of these factors, VaR has been elevated throughout 2022.\n\nThe Bank has effectively managed market risk by maintaining stable risk exposures, with daily VaR remaining within approved limits during the year.\n\nAverage VaR increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to widening of credit spreads which are reflected in updated VaR scenarios. Average Stressed VaR increased year-over-year driven by widening of credit spreads as well as changes in interest rate positions. Average Stressed VaR decreased quarter-over-quarter due to changes in bond positions.\n\nAverage IRC decreased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to changes in bond positions.\n\n## Validation of VaR Model\n\nThe Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to verify that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data.\n\n## Stress Testing\n\nThe Bank's trading business is subject to an overall global stress test limit. In addition, global businesses have stress test limits, and each broad risk class has an overall stress test threshold. Stress scenarios are designed to model extreme economic events, replicate worst-case historical experiences, or introduce severe, but plausible, hypothetical changes in key market risk factors. The stress testing program includes scenarios developed using actual historical market data during periods of market disruption, in addition to hypothetical scenarios developed by Risk Management. The events the/uni00A0Bank has modelled include the 1987 equity market crash, the 1998 Russian debt default crisis, the aftermath of/uni00A0September/uni00A011, 2001, the 2007 ABCP crisis, the credit crisis of Fall 2008, the Brexit referendum of June 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.\n\nStress tests are produced and reviewed regularly with the Market Risk Control Committee.\n\n## MARKET RISK IN OTHER WHOLESALE BANKING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Bank is also exposed to market risk arising from its investment portfolio and other non-trading portfolios. Risk Management reviews and approves policies and procedures, which are established to monitor, measure, and mitigate these risks.",

        "page_content": "## Structural (Non-Trading) Market Risk\n\nStructural (Non-Trading) Market Risk deals with managing the market risks of TD's traditional banking activities. This generally reflects the market risks arising from personal and commercial banking products (loans and deposits) as well as related funding, investments and HQLA. It does not include exposures from TD's Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. Structural market risks primarily include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\n## WHO MANAGES STRUCTURAL (NON-TRADING) MARKET RISK\n\nThe TBSM group measures and manages the market risks of the/uni00A0Bank's non-trading banking activities outside of TD's Wholesale Banking and Insurance businesses, with oversight from the ALCO. The Market Risk Control function provides independent oversight, governance, and control over these market risks. The Risk Committee reviews and approves key non-trading market risk policies, and monitors the/uni00A0Bank's positions and compliance with these policies through regular reporting and updates from senior management.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES STRUCTURAL (NON-TRADING) MARKET/uni00A0RISK\n\nNon-trading interest rate risk is viewed as a non-productive risk as it has the potential to increase earnings volatility and generate losses without providing long run expected value. As a result, TBSM's mandate is to structure the asset and liability positions of the balance sheet in order to/uni00A0achieve a target profile that controls the impact of changes in interest rates on the/uni00A0Bank's net interest income and economic value to be consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## Managing Structural Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the impact that changes in interest rates could have on the/uni00A0Bank's margins, earnings, and economic value. Interest rate risk management is designed to generate stable and predictable earnings over time. The Bank has adopted a disciplined hedging approach to manage the net interest income from its asset and liability positions. Key aspects of/uni00A0this approach are:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and managing the impact of rising or falling interest rates on net interest income and economic value, and developing strategies to manage overall sensitivity to rates across varying interest rate scenarios;\n- \u00b7 Modelling the expected impact of customer behaviour on TD's products (e.g., how actively customers exercise embedded options, such as prepaying a loan or redeeming a deposit before its maturity date);\n- \u00b7 Assigning target-modelled maturity profiles for non-maturity assets, liabilities, and equity;\n- \u00b7 Measuring the margins of TD's banking products on a fully-hedged basis, including the impact of financial options that are granted to customers; and\n- \u00b7 Developing and implementing strategies to stabilize net interest income from all retail and commercial banking products.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to interest rate risk from 'mismatched positions' when asset and liability principal and interest cash flows have different interest payment, repricing or maturity dates. The Bank measures this risk based on an assessment of: contractual cash flows, product embedded optionality, customer behaviour expectations and the modelled maturity profiles for non-maturity products. To manage this risk, the/uni00A0Bank primarily uses financial derivatives, wholesale investments, funding instruments, and other capital market alternatives.\n\nThe Bank also measures its exposure to non-maturity liabilities, such as core deposits, by assessing interest rate elasticity and balance permanence using historical data and business judgment. Fluctuations of non-maturity deposits can occur because of factors such as interest rate movements, equity market movements, and changes to customer liquidity preferences.\n\nBanking product optionality, whether from freestanding options such as mortgage rate commitments or options embedded within loans and deposits, expose the/uni00A0Bank to a significant financial risk. To manage these exposures, the/uni00A0Bank purchases options or uses a dynamic hedging process designed to replicate the payoff of a purchased option.\n\n- \u00b7 Rate Commitments: The Bank measures its exposure from freestanding mortgage rate commitment options using an expected funding profile based on historical experience. Customers' propensity to fund, and their preference for fixed or floating rate mortgage products, is influenced by factors such as market mortgage rates, house prices, and seasonality.\n- \u00b7 Asset Prepayment and other Embedded Options: The Bank models its exposure to written options embedded in some of its products, based on analyses of customer behaviour. Examples of this are the right to prepay residential mortgage loans, and the right to early redeem some term deposit products. For mortgages, econometric models are used to model prepayments and the effects of prepayment behaviour to the/uni00A0Bank. In general, mortgage prepayments are also affected by factors such as mortgage age, house prices, and GDP growth. The combined impacts from these parameters are also assessed to determine a core liquidation speed which is independent of market incentives. A similar analysis is undertaken for other products with embedded optionality.\n\n## Structural Interest Rate Risk Measures\n\nThe primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders' Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS).\n\nThe EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the net present value of the/uni00A0Bank's banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders' equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the/uni00A0Bank's own equity and excludes product margins.\n\nThe NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period.\n\nThe Bank's Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits for the/uni00A0Bank's management of non-trading interest rate risk are set by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the ALCO and the Risk Committee.",

An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the/uni00A0Bank's EVE of $1,102/uni00A0million, an increase of $764/uni00A0million from last year, and a negative impact to the/uni00A0Bank's NII of $1,381/uni00A0million, an increase of $280/uni00A0million from last year. The year-over-year increase in up shock EVE Sensitivity is primarily due to increased sensitivity of net assets funded by equity, while the year-over-year increase in down shock EVE Sensitivity is primarily due to decreased sensitivity from loan optionality in the U.S. region. The year-over-year increase in down shock NIIS is primarily due to an increase in the effective shock given the increased level of interest rates and the measurement using a -25 bps floor, partially offset by rising deposit betas, changes in deposit composition, and Treasury hedging activity. The yearover-year decrease in up shock NIIS is also primarily due to rising deposit betas, changes in deposit composition, and Treasury hedging activity. As at October 31, 2022, reported EVE and NII Sensitivities remain within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite and established Board limits.\n\n## Managing Non-trading Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to losses that could result from changes in foreign-currency exchange rates. Assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies create foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to non-trading foreign exchange risk primarily from its investments in foreign operations. When the/uni00A0Bank's foreign currency assets are greater or less than its liabilities in that currency, they create a foreign currency open position. An adverse change in foreign exchange rates can impact the/uni00A0Bank's reported net income and shareholders' equity, and also its capital ratios.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of an adverse foreign exchange rate change on certain capital ratios, the/uni00A0Bank's net investments in foreign operations are hedged so certain capital ratios change by no more than an acceptable amount for a given change in foreign exchange rates. The Bank does not generally hedge the earnings of foreign subsidiaries which results in changes to the/uni00A0Bank's consolidated earnings when relevant foreign exchange rates change. As at October/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, the/uni00A0Bank has executed foreign exchange hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange volatility to closing capital of the First Horizon acquisition.\n\n## Other Non-trading Market Risks\n\nOther structural market risks monitored on a regular basis include:\n\n- \u00b7 Basis Risk The Bank is exposed to risks related to the difference in various market indices.\n- \u00b7 Equity Risk The Bank is exposed to equity risk through its equitylinked guaranteed investment certificate product offering. The exposure is managed by purchasing options to replicate the equity payoff. The Bank is also exposed to non-trading equity price risk primarily from its share-based compensation plans where certain employees are awarded share units equivalent to the/uni00A0Bank's common shares as compensation\n\ncapital of the First Horizon acquisition. Since these swaps were pre-existing hedges which economically hedge the/uni00A0Bank's non-trading market risk, their continued inclusion has no impact on the year-over-year results.\n\nfor services provided to the/uni00A0Bank. These share units are recorded as a liability over the vesting period and revalued at each reporting period until settled in cash. Changes in the/uni00A0Bank's share price can impact noninterest expenses. The Bank uses derivative instruments to manage its non-trading equity price risk. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to equity risk from investment securities designated at FVOCI.\n\n## Managing Investment Portfolios\n\nThe Bank manages a securities portfolio that is integrated into the overall asset and liability management process. The securities portfolio is comprised of high-quality, low-risk securities and managed in a manner appropriate to the attainment of the following goals: (1) to generate a targeted credit of funds to deposit balances that are in excess of loan balances; (2)/uni00A0to provide a sufficient pool of liquid assets to meet deposit and loan fluctuations and overall liquidity management objectives; (3)/uni00A0to/uni00A0provide eligible securities to meet collateral and cash management requirements; and (4) to manage the target interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet. The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Enterprise Investment Policy that sets out limits for the/uni00A0Bank's investment portfolio. In addition, the Wholesale Banking and Insurance businesses also hold investments that are managed separately.\n\n## WHY NET INTEREST MARGIN FLUCTUATES OVER TIME\n\nAs previously noted, the/uni00A0Bank's approach to structural (non-trading) market risk is designed to generate stable and predictable earnings over time, regardless of cash flow mismatches and the exercise of options granted to customers. This approach also creates margin certainty on loan and deposit profitability as they are booked. Despite this approach however, the/uni00A0Bank's NIM is subject to change over time for the following reasons (among others):\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in margins earned on new and renewing products relative to the margin previously earned on matured products;\n- \u00b7 The weighted-average margin will shift as the mix of business changes;\n- \u00b7 Changes in the basis between various benchmark rates (e.g. Prime, CDOR, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or LIBOR);\n- \u00b7 The lag in changing product prices in response to changes in wholesale interest rates;\n- \u00b7 Changes from the repricing of hedging strategies to manage the investment profile of the/uni00A0Bank's non-rate sensitive deposits; and\n- \u00b7 Margin changes from the portion of the/uni00A0Bank's deposits that are non-rate sensitive but not expected to be longer term in nature, resulting in a shorter term investment profile and higher sensitivity to/uni00A0short-term rates.\n\nThe general level of interest rates will affect the return the/uni00A0Bank generates on its modelled maturity profile for core non-rate sensitive deposits and the investment profile for its net equity position as it evolves over time. The general level of interest rates is also a key driver of some modelled option exposures, and will affect the cost of hedging such exposures. The Bank's approach to managing these factors tends to moderate their impact over time, resulting in a more stable and predictable earnings stream.\n\nrates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.",

This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in all of the/uni00A0Bank's business activities, including the practices and controls used to manage other risks such as credit, market, and liquidity risk. Failure to manage operational risk can result in financial loss (direct or indirect), reputational harm, or regulatory censure and penalties.\n\nThe Bank seeks to actively mitigate and manage operational risk in order to create and sustain shareholder value, successfully execute the/uni00A0Bank's business strategies, operate efficiently, and provide reliable, secure, and convenient access to financial services. The Bank maintains a formal enterprise-wide operational risk management framework that emphasizes a strong risk management and internal control culture throughout TD.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, operational risk losses remained within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite./uni00A0Refer to Note 27 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on material legal or regulatory actions.\n\n## WHO MANAGES OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nOperational Risk Management is an independent function that owns and maintains the/uni00A0Bank's Operational Risk Management Framework. This framework sets out the enterprise-wide governance processes, policies, and practices to identify, assess, measure, control, monitor, escalate, report, and communicate on operational risk. Operational Risk Management is designed to provide appropriate monitoring and reporting of the/uni00A0Bank's operational risk profile and exposures to senior management through the OROC, the ERMC, and the Risk Committee.\n\nIn addition to the framework, Operational Risk Management owns and maintains, or has oversight of, the/uni00A0Bank's operational risk policies including those that govern business continuity and crisis management, third-party risk management, data risk management, financial crime and fraud risk management, project risk management, and technology and cyber security risk management.\n\nThe senior management of individual business units and corporate areas is/uni00A0responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk following the/uni00A0Bank's established operational risk management framework, policies and the three lines of defence model. An independent risk management oversight function supports each business segment and corporate area, and monitors and challenges the implementation and use of the operational risk management framework programs according to the nature and scope of the operational risks inherent in the area. The senior executives in each business unit and corporate area participate in a Risk Management Committee that oversees operational risk management issues and initiatives.\n\nUltimately, every employee has a role to play in managing operational risk. In addition to policies and procedures guiding employee activities, training is available to all staff regarding specific types of operational risks and their role in helping to protect the interests and assets of the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework outlines the internal risk and control structure to manage operational risk and includes the operational risk appetite, governance processes, and policies. The Operational Risk Management Framework supports alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's ERF and risk appetite. The framework incorporates sound industry practices and meets regulatory requirements. Key components of/uni00A0the framework include:\n\n## Governance and Policy\n\nManagement reporting and organizational structures emphasize accountability, ownership, and effective oversight of each business unit and each corporate area's operational risk exposures. In addition, the expectations of the Risk Committee and senior management for managing operational risk are set out by enterprise-wide policies and practices.\n\n## Risk and Control Self-Assessment\n\nInternal controls are one of the primary methods of safeguarding the/uni00A0Bank's employees, customers, assets, and information, and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud. Management undertakes comprehensive assessments of key risk exposures and the internal controls/uni00A0in place to reduce or offset these risks. Senior management reviews the results of these evaluations to determine that risk management and internal controls are effective, appropriate, and compliant with the/uni00A0Bank's/uni00A0policies.\n\n## Operational Risk Event Monitoring\n\nTo reduce the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to future loss, it is critical that the/uni00A0Bank remains aware of and responds to its own and industry operational risks. The Bank's policies and processes require that operational risk events be identified, tracked, and reported to the appropriate level of management to facilitate the/uni00A0Bank's analysis and management of its risks and inform the assessment of suitable corrective and preventative action. The Bank also reviews, analyzes, and benchmarks itself against operational risk losses that have occurred at other financial institutions using information acquired through recognized industry data providers.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario Analysis is a systematic and repeatable process of obtaining expert business and risk opinion to derive assessments of the likelihood and potential loss estimates of high impact operational events that are unexpected and outside the normal course of business. The Bank applies this practice to meet risk measurement and risk management objectives. The process includes the use of relevant external operational loss event data that is assessed considering the/uni00A0Bank's operational risk profile and control structure. The program raises awareness and educates business and corporate segments regarding existing and emerging risks, which may/uni00A0result in the identification and implementation of new scenarios and risk mitigation action plans to minimize tail risk.\n\n## Risk Reporting\n\nRisk Management regularly monitors risk-related measures and the risk profile throughout the/uni00A0Bank to report to senior management and the Risk Committee. Operational risk measures are systematically tracked, assessed, and reported to promote management accountability and direct the appropriate level of attention to current and emerging issues.\n\n## Insurance\n\nTD's Corporate Insurance team, with oversight from TD Risk Management, utilizes insurance and other risk transfer arrangements to mitigate and reduce potential future losses related to operational risk. Risk Management includes oversight of the effective use of insurance aligned with the/uni00A0Bank's risk management strategy and risk appetite. Insurance terms and provisions, including types and amounts of coverage, are regularly assessed so that the/uni00A0Bank's tolerance for risk and, where applicable, statutory requirements are satisfied. The management process includes conducting regular in-depth risk and financial analysis and identifying opportunities to transfer elements of the/uni00A0Bank's risk to third parties where appropriate. The Bank transacts with external insurers that satisfy its minimum financial rating requirements.\n\n## Technology and Cyber Security\n\nVirtually all aspects of the/uni00A0Bank's business and operations use technology and information to create and support new markets, competitive products, delivery channels, as well as other business operations and opportunities.\n\nThe Bank manages these risks to support adequate and proper day-today operations; and protect against unauthorized access of the/uni00A0Bank's technology, infrastructure, systems, information, or data. To enable this, the/uni00A0Bank actively monitors, manages, and continues to enhance its ability to mitigate these technology and cyber security risks through enterprisewide programs and industry-accepted cyber threat management practices to enable rapid detection and response.\n\nThe Bank's Cybersecurity Subcommittee provides dedicated senior executive oversight, direction and guidance regarding management of/uni00A0risks relating to cybersecurity, including cyber terrorism and activism, cyber fraud, cyber espionage, ransomware extortion, identity theft and",

        "page_content": "data theft. The Cybersecurity Subcommittee endorses actions and makes recommendations to the CEO and the ERMC as appropriate, including in some instances, supporting onward recommendations to the Risk Committee. Together with the/uni00A0Bank's Operational Risk Management Framework, technology and cyber security programs also include enhanced resiliency planning and testing, as well as disciplined change management practices.\n\n## Data Management\n\nThe Bank's data assets are governed and managed to preserve value and support business objectives. Inconsistent or inadequate data governance and management practices may compromise the/uni00A0Bank's data and information assets which could result in financial and reputational impacts. The Bank's Enterprise Data Governance Office, Corporate and Technology partners develop and implement enterprise-wide standards and practices that describe how data and information assets are created, used, or maintained on behalf of the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n## Business Continuity and Crisis Management\n\nThe Bank maintains an enterprise-wide business continuity and crisis management program that supports management's ability to operate the/uni00A0Bank's businesses and operations (including providing customers access to products and services) in the event of a business disruption incident. All areas of the/uni00A0Bank are required to maintain and regularly test business continuity plans to maintain resilience and facilitate the continuity and recovery of business operations. This program is supported by formal crisis management measures so that the appropriate level of leadership, oversight and management is applied to incidents affecting the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n## Third-Party Management\n\nA third-party supplier/vendor is an entity that supplies products, services or other business activities, functions or processes to or on behalf of the/uni00A0Bank. While these relationships bring benefits to the/uni00A0Bank's businesses and customers, the/uni00A0Bank also needs to manage and minimize any risks related to the activity. The Bank does this through an enterprise third-party risk management program that is designed to manage third-party activities throughout the life cycle of an arrangement and provide a level of risk management and senior management oversight which is appropriate to the size, risk, and criticality of the third-party arrangement.\n\n## Change Delivery/Project Management\n\nThe Bank has established a disciplined approach to delivering change across the enterprise coordinated by the Enterprise Project Delivery Excellence group. This approach involves senior management governance and oversight of the/uni00A0Bank's change portfolio and leverages leading industry practices to guide the/uni00A0Bank's use of a standardized delivery methodology, defined accountabilities and capabilities, and portfolio reporting and management tools to support successful delivery.\n\n## Fraud Management\n\nThe Bank develops and implements enterprise-wide fraud management strategies, policies, and practices that are designed to minimize the number, size and scope of fraudulent activities perpetrated against it. The Bank employs prevention, detection and monitoring capabilities across the enterprise that are designed to help protect customers, shareholders, and employees from increasingly sophisticated fraud risk. Fraud risk is managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies, procedures, employee education in fraud risks, and monitoring activity to help maintain adherence to the Fraud Risk Management Framework. The Fraud Risk Management Framework describes the governance, policies, and processes that the/uni00A0Bank's businesses employ to proactively manage and govern fraud risk within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite which is embedded in the/uni00A0Bank's day to day operations and culture. The Bank has also established a dedicated fraud risk measure within its operational risk appetite to better monitor and assess fraud impacts across the enterprise.\n\n## Operational Risk Capital Measurement\n\nThe Bank's operational risk capital is determined using the Basel II Standardized Approach (TSA). Under this approach, the/uni00A0Bank applies prescribed factors to a three-year average of annual gross income for each of eight different business lines representing the different activities of the institution such as Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset/uni00A0Management.\n\n## Model Risk\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences arising from decisions based on incorrect or misused models and other estimation approaches and their outputs. It can lead to financial loss, reputational risk, or incorrect business and strategic decisions.\n\n## WHO MANAGES MODEL RISK\n\nPrimary accountability for the management of model risk resides with the senior management of individual businesses with respect to the models they use. The Model Risk Governance Committee provides oversight of governance, risk, and control matters, by providing a platform to guide, challenge, and advise decision makers and model owners in model risk related matters. Model Risk Management monitors and reports on existing and emerging model risks, and provides periodic assessments to senior management, Risk Management, the Risk Committee, and regulators on the state of model risk at TD and alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's Model Risk Appetite. The Risk Committee approves the/uni00A0Bank's Model Risk Management Framework and Model Risk Policy.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES MODEL RISK\n\nThe Bank manages model risk in accordance with management approved model risk policies and supervisory guidance which encompass the life cycle of a model, including proof of concept, development, validation, implementation, usage, and ongoing model monitoring. The Bank's Model Risk Management Framework also captures key processes that may be partially or wholly qualitative, or based on expert judgment.\n\nSegments identify the need for a new model and are responsible for model development and documentation according to the/uni00A0Bank's policies and standards. During model development, controls with respect to code generation, acceptance testing, and usage are established and documented to a level of detail and comprehensiveness matching their model risk rating. Once models are implemented, model owners are responsible for ongoing monitoring and usage in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's Model Risk Policy. In cases where a model is deemed obsolete or unsuitable for its originally intended purposes, it is decommissioned in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's policies.\n\nModel Risk Management provides oversight, maintains a centralized inventory of all models as defined in the/uni00A0Bank's Model Risk Policy, validates and approves new and existing models on a pre-determined schedule depending on the model risk rating, sets model monitoring standards, and provides training to all stakeholders. The validation process varies in rigour, depending on the model risk rating, but at a minimum contains a detailed determination of:\n\n- \u00b7 the conceptual soundness of model methodologies and underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions;\n- \u00b7 the risk associated with a model based on intrinsic risk, materiality and criticality;\n- \u00b7 the sensitivity of model-to-model assumptions and changes in data inputs including stress testing; and\n- \u00b7 the limitations of a model and the compensating risk mitigation mechanisms in place to address the limitations.\n\nWhen appropriate, validation includes a benchmarking exercise which may include the building of an independent model based on an alternative modelling approach. The results of the benchmark model are compared to/uni00A0the model being assessed to validate the appropriateness of the model's methodology and its use. As with traditional model approaches, machinelearning models are also subject to the same rigorous standards and risk management practices.\n\nAt the conclusion of the validation process, a model will either be approved for use or will be rejected and require redevelopment or other courses of action. Models identified as obsolete or no longer appropriate for use, due to changes in industry practice, the business environment or/uni00A0Bank strategies, are subject to decommissioning.\n\nThe Bank has policies and procedures in place designed to properly discern models from non-models, and the level of independent challenge and oversight corresponds to the materiality and complexity of models.",

        "page_content": "## Insurance Risk\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of financial loss due to actual experience emerging differently from expectations in insurance product pricing and/or design, underwriting, reinsurance protection and, claims or reserving either at the inception of an insurance or reinsurance contract, during the lifecycle of the claim or at the valuation date. Unfavourable experience could emerge due to adverse fluctuations in timing, actual size, frequency of claims (for example, driven by non-life premium risk, non-life reserving risk, catastrophic risk, mortality risk, morbidity risk, and longevity risk), or/uni00A0policyholder behaviour.\n\nInsurance contracts provide financial protection by transferring insured risks to the issuer in exchange for premiums. The Bank is engaged in insurance businesses relating to property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance, and reinsurance, through various subsidiaries; it is/uni00A0through these businesses that the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to insurance risk.\n\n## WHO MANAGES INSURANCE RISK\n\nSenior management within the insurance business units has primary responsibility for managing insurance risk with oversight by the CRO for Insurance, who reports into Risk Management. The Audit Committee acts as the Audit and Conduct Review Committee for the Canadian insurance company subsidiaries. The insurance company subsidiaries also have their own boards of directors who provide additional risk management oversight.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES INSURANCE RISK\n\nThe Bank's risk governance practices are designed to support independent oversight and control of risk within the insurance business. The TD/uni00A0Insurance Risk Committee and its subcommittees provide critical oversight of the risk management activities within the insurance business and monitor compliance with insurance risk policies. The Bank's Insurance Risk Management Framework and Insurance Risk Policy collectively outline the internal risk and control structure to manage insurance risk and include risk appetite, policies, processes, as well as limits and governance. These documents are maintained by Risk Management and support alignment with the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite for insurance risk.\n\nThe assessment of policy (premium and claims) liabilities is central to the insurance operation. The Bank establishes reserves to cover estimated future payments (including loss adjustment expenses) on all claims or terminations/surrenders of premium arising from insurance contracts underwritten. The reserves cannot be established with complete certainty, and represent management's best estimate for future payments. As such, the/uni00A0Bank regularly monitors estimates against actual and emerging experience and adjusts reserves as appropriate if experience emerges differently than anticipated. Claim and premium liabilities are governed by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's general insurance and life and health reserving policies.\n\nSound product design is an essential element of managing risk. The/uni00A0Bank's exposure to insurance risk is mostly short-term in nature as the principal underwriting risk relates to automobile and home insurance for individuals.\n\nInsurance market cycles, as well as changes in insurance legislation, the regulatory environment, judicial environment, trends in court awards, climate patterns, pandemics or other applicable public health emergencies, and the economic environment may impact the performance of the insurance business. Consistent pricing policies and underwriting standards are maintained.\n\nThere is also exposure to concentration risk associated with general insurance and life and health coverage. Exposure to insurance risk concentration is managed through established underwriting guidelines, limits, and authorization levels that govern the acceptance of risk. Concentration of insurance risk is also mitigated through the purchase of reinsurance. The insurance business' reinsurance programs are governed by catastrophe and reinsurance risk management policies.\n\nStrategies are in place to manage the risk to the/uni00A0Bank's reinsurance business. Underwriting risk on business assumed is managed through a policy that limits exposure to certain types of business and countries. The vast majority of reinsurance treaties are annually renewable, which minimizes long-term risk. Pandemic exposure is reviewed and estimated annually within the reinsurance business to manage concentration risk.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nThe risk of having insufficient cash or collateral to meet financial obligations and an inability to, in a timely manner, raise funding or monetize assets at a non-distressed price. Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support or the need to pledge additional collateral.\n\n## TD'S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE\n\nThe Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by the OSFI LAR guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank's funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding, and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank's strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe Bank's ALCO oversees the/uni00A0Bank's liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The GLF Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the/uni00A0Bank's liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the/uni00A0Bank's liquidity position and approves the/uni00A0Bank's Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually.\n\nThe Bank has established TDGUS as TD's U.S. IHC, as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD's U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the/uni00A0Bank's liquidity management framework.\n\nThe following areas are responsible for measuring, monitoring, and managing liquidity risks for major business segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Enterprise Liquidity Risk in Risk Management is responsible for maintaining liquidity risk management and asset pledging policies, along with associated limits, standards, and processes which are established to ensure that consistent and efficient liquidity management approaches are applied across all of the/uni00A0Bank's operations. Risk Management jointly owns the Liquidity Risk Management Framework along with the SET member responsible for Treasury. Enterprise Liquidity Risk provides oversight of liquidity risk across the enterprise and provides independent risk assessment and effective challenge of liquidity risk management. Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for independent liquidity risk metric reporting;\n- \u00b7 Treasury Liquidity Management manages the liquidity position of the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance, Corporate, Wholesale Banking, and U.S./uni00A0Retail segments, as/uni00A0well as the liquidity position of CUSO; and\n- \u00b7 Other regional operations, including those within TD's insurance business, foreign branches, and/or subsidiaries are responsible for managing their liquidity risk in compliance with their own policies, and/uni00A0local regulatory requirements, while maintaining alignment with the enterprise framework.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nThe Bank manages the liquidity profile of its businesses to be within the defined liquidity risk appetite, and maintains target requirements for liquidity survivability using a combination of internal and regulatory measures. The Bank's overall liquidity requirement is defined as the amount of liquid assets the/uni00A0Bank needs to hold to be able to cover expected future cash flow requirements, plus a prudent reserve against potential cash outflows in the event of a capital markets disruption or other events that could affect the/uni00A0Bank's access to funding or destabilize its deposit base.\n\nThe Bank maintains an internal view for measuring and managing liquidity that uses an assumed Severe Combined Stress Scenario (SCSS). The SCSS considers potential liquidity requirements during a crisis resulting from a loss of confidence in the/uni00A0Bank's ability to meet obligations as they come due. In addition to this bank-specific event, the SCSS also incorporates the impact of a stressed market-wide liquidity event that results in a significant reduction in the availability of funding for all institutions and a decrease in the marketability of assets. The Bank's liquidity risk management policies stipulate that the/uni00A0Bank must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to support business growth, and to cover identified stressed liquidity requirements under the SCSS, for a period of up to 90 days. The Bank calculates stressed liquidity requirements for the SCSS related to the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 wholesale funding maturing in the next 90 days (assumes maturing debt will be repaid instead of rolled over);\n- \u00b7 accelerated attrition or 'run-off' of deposit balances;\n- \u00b7 increased utilization of available credit and liquidity facilities; and\n- \u00b7 increased collateral requirements associated with downgrades in the/uni00A0Bank's credit ratings and adverse movement in reference rates for derivative and securities financing transactions.\n\nThe Bank also manages its liquidity to comply with the regulatory liquidity requirements in the OSFI LAR (the LCR, the NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) monitoring tool). The LCR requires that banks maintain a minimum liquidity coverage of 100% over a 30-day stress period, the NSFR requires that banks maintain available stable funding (ASF) in excess of required stable funding (RSF) for periods up to one year (a minimum NSFR of 100%), and the NCCF monitors the/uni00A0Bank's detailed cash flow gaps for various time bands. As a result, the/uni00A0Bank's liquidity is managed to/uni00A0the higher of its internal liquidity requirements and target buffers over the regulatory minimums.\n\nThe Bank considers potential regulatory restrictions on liquidity transferability in the calculation of enterprise liquidity positions. Accordingly, surplus liquidity domiciled in regulated subsidiaries may be/uni00A0excluded from consolidated liquidity positions as appropriate.\n\nThe Bank's Funds Transfer Pricing process considers liquidity risk as a key determinant of the cost or credit of funds to the retail and wholesale banking businesses. Liquidity costs applied to loans and trading assets are determined based on the cash flow or stressed liquidity profile, while deposits are assessed based on the required liquidity reserves and balance stability. Liquidity costs are also applied to other contingent obligations like/uni00A0undrawn lines of credit provided to customers.\n\n## LIQUID ASSETS\n\nThe unencumbered liquid assets the/uni00A0Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the/uni00A0Bank believes can be/uni00A0monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the/uni00A0Bank expects any reduction in market value of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given its underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity.",

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both onbalance sheet and off-balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice.\n- 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity.\n- 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the/uni00A0Bank's day-today operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity.\n- 4 Assets supporting TD's long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance.\n- 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice.\n\n## LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING/uni00A0PLANS\n\nIn addition to the SCSS, the/uni00A0Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD-specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk/uni00A0factors material to the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also/uni00A0part of the/uni00A0Bank's EWST program.\n\nThe Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank's CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the/uni00A0Bank's overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation, and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the/uni00A0Bank's CFP are aligned with the/uni00A0Bank's Crisis Management Recovery Plan.\n\n- 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, CMHC insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA/uni00A0MBS).\n- 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC.\n- 8 Assets reported in the 'Bank-owned assets' column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the 'Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions' column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets.\n- 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the 'Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions' column to/uni00A0avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets.\n- 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories.\n\n## CREDIT RATINGS\n\nCredit ratings impact the/uni00A0Bank's borrowing costs and ability to raise funds./uni00A0Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the/uni00A0Bank's ability to enter into derivative transactions.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time to time, based on a number of/uni00A0factors including the/uni00A0Bank's financial strength, competitive position, and/uni00A0liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the/uni00A0Bank's control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.",

The Bank's funding activities are conducted in accordance with liquidity risk management policies that require assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile.\n\nThe Bank's primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the/uni00A0Bank's large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, 'P&C deposits') that make up over 70% of the/uni00A0Bank's total funding.\n\n| T A B L E   5 6                | SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING     | SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING   | SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (millions of Canadian dollars) | (millions of Canadian dollars) |                              | As at                        |\n|                                |                                | October 31   2022            | October 31  2021             |\n| P&C deposits - Canadian        | P&C deposits - Canadian        | $  525,294                   | $ 519,466                    |\n| P&C deposits - U.S. 1          | P&C deposits - U.S. 1          | 493,223                      | 472,742                      |\n| Total                          | Total                          | $ 1,018,517                  | $ 992,208                    |\n\n- 1 P&C deposits in U.S. are presented on a Canadian equivalent basis and therefore period-over-period movements reflect both underlying growth and changes in the foreign exchange rate.\n\nThe following table summarizes the registered term funding and capital/uni00A0programs by geography, with the related program size as at October 31, 2022.\n\n| Canada                                                                                                  | United States                                                       | Europe                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Capital Securities Program ($15 billion) Canadian Senior Medium-Term Linked Notes  Program ($5 billion) | U.S. SEC (F-3) Registered Capital and Debt  Program (US$75 billion) | United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA)  Registered Legislative Covered Bond Program  ($80 billion) |\n| HELOC ABS Program (Genesis Trust II)  ($7/uni00A0billion)                                               | U.S. SEC (F-3) Registered Capital and Debt  Program (US$75 billion) | UKLA Registered European Medium-Term  Note Program (US$20 billion)                                  |\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Bank's term debt by currency and funding type.

The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank's wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year and less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers' acceptances.",

and b) senior debt issued on or after September/uni00A023, 2018 which is excluded from the bank recapitalization 'bail-in' regime, including debt with an original term-to-maturity of less than 400 days.\n\nExcluding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the/uni00A0Bank's total 2022 mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors was $1.7/uni00A0billion (2021 - $1.8 billion), and other asset-backed securities issued was $0.3 billion (2021 - $0.7 billion). The Bank also issued $44.6 billion of unsecured medium-term notes (2021 - $20.5/uni00A0billion) and $17.5 billion covered bonds (2021 - nil), in various currencies and markets during the year ended October 31, 2022.\n\n## REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING LIQUIDITY AND/uni00A0FUNDING\n\nIn January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its LAR guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the LAR involve enhancements to the NCCF\n\n## MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS\n\nThe following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the/uni00A0Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the/uni00A0Bank's short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs.\n\n- 5 Comprised of senior debt subject to conversion under the bank recapitalization 'bail-in' regime. Excludes $2.3/uni00A0billion of structured notes subject to conversion under the 'bail-in' regime/uni00A0(October/uni00A031, 2021 - $1.4 billion).\n- 6 Subordinated notes and debentures are not considered wholesale funding as they may be raised primarily for capital management purposes.\n- 7 Includes fixed-term deposits from non-bank institutions (unsecured) of $21.3/uni00A0billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $14.6/uni00A0billion).\n\nsupervisory tool to improve the risk sensitivity of the metric. Other significant changes include the addition of contingencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The effective date of the changes will be April/uni00A02023.\n\nIn January 2022, OSFI published an updated Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline, which covers liquidity disclosures among other topics. The guideline provides OSFI's updated expectations for the domestic implementation of Basel's Pillar 3 Framework. The guideline will not materially impact the/uni00A0Bank's existing liquidity disclosures, but will contribute to improved consistency and comparability of disclosures across jurisdictions. The effective date of the changes will be in the second fiscal quarter of 2023.\n\nThe maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the/uni00A0Bank's maturity transformation or the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the/uni00A0Bank's non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the/uni00A0Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such nontrading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.",

        "page_content": "## Capital Adequacy Risk\n\nCapital adequacy risk is the risk of insufficient level and composition of/uni00A0capital being available in relation to the amount of capital required to/uni00A0carry out the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and/or satisfy regulatory and internal capital adequacy requirements under normal and stress conditions.\n\nCapital is held to protect the viability of the/uni00A0Bank in the event of unexpected financial losses. Capital represents the loss-absorbing funding required to provide a cushion to protect depositors and other creditors from unexpected losses.\n\nManaging capital levels requires that the/uni00A0Bank holds sufficient capital, in/uni00A0normal and stress environments, to avoid the risk of breaching minimum capital levels prescribed by regulators and internal Board limits.\n\n## WHO MANAGES CAPITAL ADEQUACY RISK\n\nThe Board oversees the/uni00A0Bank's capital adequacy and capital management by reviewing adherence to capital targets and approving the annual capital plan and the Global Capital Management Policy. The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Framework. The CRO and the SET member responsible for TBSM oversee that the/uni00A0Bank's ICAAP is effective in meeting capital adequacy requirements.\n\nThe ALCO recommends and maintains the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Framework and the Global Capital Management Policy in/uni00A0support of the effective and prudent management of the/uni00A0Bank's capital/uni00A0position and maintenance of adequate capital. It oversees the allocation of capital limits for business segments and reviews adherence to/uni00A0capital targets.\n\nTBSM is responsible for forecasting and monitoring compliance with capital targets, on a consolidated basis, with oversight provided by ALCO. TBSM updates the capital forecast, including appropriate changes to capital issuance, repurchase and redemption. The capital forecast is reviewed by ALCO. TBSM also leads the ICAAP and EWST processes. The Bank's business segments are responsible for managing to the allocated capital limits.\n\nAdditionally, regulated subsidiaries of the/uni00A0Bank, including certain insurance subsidiaries and subsidiaries in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, manage their capital adequacy risk in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Capital management policies and procedures of subsidiaries are also required to conform with those of the/uni00A0Bank. U.S./uni00A0regulated subsidiaries of the/uni00A0Bank are required to follow several regulatory guidelines, rules and expectations related to capital planning/uni00A0and stress testing including the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's Regulation/uni00A0YY establishing Enhanced Prudential Standards for Foreign Banking Organizations, applicable to U.S. Bank Holding Companies. Refer/uni00A0to the sections on 'Future Regulatory Capital Developments', 'Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing', and 'Risk Factors That May/uni00A0Affect Future Results' for further details.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES CAPITAL ADEQUACY RISK\n\nCapital resources are managed in a manner designed so that the/uni00A0Bank's capital position can support business strategies under both current and future business operating environments. The Bank manages its operations within the capital constraints defined by both internal and regulatory capital requirements, so that it meets the higher of these requirements.\n\nRegulatory capital requirements represent minimum capital levels. The Board approves capital targets that provide a sufficient buffer so that the/uni00A0Bank meets minimum capital requirements under stress conditions. The purpose of these capital targets is to reduce the risk of a breach of minimum capital requirements, due to an unexpected stress event, allowing management the opportunity to react to declining capital levels before minimum capital requirements are breached. Capital targets are defined in the Global Capital Management Policy.\n\nA periodic monitoring process is undertaken to plan and forecast capital requirements. As part of the annual planning process, business segments are allocated individual RWA and Leverage exposure limits. Capital generation and usage are monitored and reported to the ALCO.\n\nThe Bank assesses the sensitivity of its forecast capital requirements and new capital formations to various economic conditions through its EWST process. The results of the EWST are considered in the determination of capital targets and capital risk appetite limits.\n\nThe Bank also determines its internal capital requirements through the ICAAP process using models to measure the risk-based capital required based on its own tolerance for the risk of unexpected losses. This risk tolerance is calibrated to the required confidence level so that the/uni00A0Bank will be able to meet its obligations, even after absorbing severe unexpected losses over a one-year period.\n\nIn addition, the/uni00A0Bank has a Capital Contingency Plan that is designed to prepare management to maintain capital adequacy through periods of bank-specific or systemic market stress. The Capital Contingency Plan outlines the governance and procedures to be followed if the/uni00A0Bank's consolidated capital levels are forecast to fall below capital targets or when there are capital concerns from disruptive events or trends. It also outlines potential management actions that may be taken to prevent such a breach from occurring.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk\n\nLegal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct (LRCC) risk is the risk associated with the/uni00A0Bank's failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, contractual obligations, the/uni00A0Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics, or standards of fair business conduct or market conduct, which can lead to fines, sanctions, liabilities, or reputational harm that could be material to the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to LRCC risk in virtually all of its activities. Failure to mitigate LRCC risk and meet regulatory and legal requirements can impact the/uni00A0Bank's ability to meet strategic objectives, poses a risk of censure or penalty, may lead to litigation, and puts the/uni00A0Bank's reputation at risk. Financial penalties, reputational damage, and other costs associated with legal proceedings, and unfavourable judicial or regulatory determinations may also adversely affect the/uni00A0Bank's business, results of operations and financial condition. LRCC risk differs from other banking risks, such as credit risk or market risk, in that it is typically not a risk actively or deliberately assumed by management in expectation of a return and also because LRCC risk generally cannot be effectively mitigated by trying to limit its impact to any one business or jurisdiction, as realized LRCC risk may adversely impact unrelated businesses or jurisdictions. LRCC risk exposure is inherent in the normal course of operating the/uni00A0Bank's businesses. Known LRCC risks continue to rapidly evolve, as a result of new or emerging threats, including geopolitical and those associated with use of new, emerging and interrelated technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, models and decision-making tools.\n\n## WHO MANAGES LEGAL, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, AND CONDUCT RISK\n\nThe proactive and effective management of LRCC risk is complex given the breadth and pervasiveness of exposure. The LRCC Risk Management Framework applies enterprise-wide to the/uni00A0Bank and to all its corporate functions, business segments, its governance, risk, and oversight functions, and its subsidiaries, and is aligned with the/uni00A0Bank's ERF. All the/uni00A0Bank's businesses are accountable for operating their business in compliance with LRCC requirements applicable to their jurisdiction and specific businesses. Businesses are also accountable for the LRCC risk that they generate in their operations, including LRCC risks that may arise in their dealings with third-party vendors. These accountabilities involve assessing the risk, designing and implementing controls, and monitoring and reporting on their ongoing effectiveness to safeguard the businesses from operating outside of the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite. Independent oversight functions (the 'Oversight Functions') such as Compliance, GAML, Corporate Defence Group, and Regulatory Risk provide objective guidance, and oversight with respect to managing LRCC risk. Legal and Regulatory Risk provide advice with respect to managing LRCC risk. Representatives of these groups interact regularly with senior executives of the/uni00A0Bank's businesses. Also, the/uni00A0senior management of Legal, Compliance, and GAML have established regular meetings with and reporting to the Audit Committee, which oversees the establishment and maintenance of policies and programs reasonably designed to achieve and maintain the/uni00A0Bank's compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Senior management of Compliance Department and the Corporate Defence Group also report regularly to the Corporate Governance Committee, which oversees conduct risk",

In addition, senior management of Regulatory Risk has established periodic reporting to the Board and its committees.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES LEGAL, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND CONDUCT RISK\n\nEffective management of LRCC risk is a result of enterprise-wide collaboration and requires (a) independent and objective identification and assessment of LRCC risk, (b) objective guidance and advisory services and/or independent challenge and oversight to identify, assess, control, and monitor LRCC risk, and (c) an approved set of frameworks, policies, procedures, guidelines, and practices. While each business line is accountable for operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and for effectively managing LRCC risk, each of the Oversight Functions plays a critical role in the management of LRCC risk at the/uni00A0Bank. Depending on the circumstances, they play different roles at different times: 'trusted advisor', provider of objective guidance, independent challenge, and oversight and control (including 'gatekeeper' or approver).\n\nIn particular, Compliance performs the following functions: it acts as an independent Regulatory Compliance oversight function to establish enterprise standards for business and Oversight Functions in managing LRCC risk; it fosters a culture of integrity, ethics and compliance across the organization to manage and mitigate Regulatory Compliance Risks; it/uni00A0assesses the adequacy of, adherence to, and effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's day-to-day RCM controls; it proactively manages regulatory change and maintains a Framework for Oversight Functions to do the same; and it supports the Global Chief Compliance Officer in providing an opinion to the Audit Committee as to whether the RCM controls are sufficiently robust to achieve compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Corporate Defence Group is accountable for leading the Enterprise Conduct Risk Program. It acts as a Conduct Risk management oversight function that works with key enterprise and segment stakeholders to mitigate conduct risk across the organization. The Corporate Defence Group works in partnership with Human Resources and Operational Risk Management to provide oversight and challenge to the businesses in their management of conduct risk.\n\nGAML acts as an independent regulatory compliance and risk management oversight function and is responsible for regulatory compliance and the broader prudential risk management components of the AML, Anti-Terrorist Financing, Sanctions, and Anti-Bribery/AntiCorruption programs (collectively, the 'GAML Programs'), including their design, content, and enterprise-wide implementation; develops standards, monitors, evaluates, and reports on GAML program controls, design, and execution; and reports on the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the GAML Programs, including program design and operation. In addition, Compliance and GAML have developed methodologies and processes to measure and aggregate regulatory compliance risks, AML program and conduct risks on an ongoing basis as a baseline to assess whether the/uni00A0Bank's internal controls are effective in adequately mitigating such risks and determine whether individual or aggregate business activities are/uni00A0conducted within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite.\n\nLegal acts as an independent provider of legal services and advice and protects the/uni00A0Bank from unacceptable legal risk. Legal has also developed methodologies for measuring litigation risk for adherence to the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite.\n\nProcesses employed by Legal, Compliance, and GAML (including policies and frameworks, training and education, and the/uni00A0Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics) support the responsibility of each business to adhere to LRCC requirements.\n\nFinally, the/uni00A0Bank's Regulatory Risk and Government Affairs departments also create and facilitate communication with elected officials and regulators, monitor legislation and regulations, support business relationships with governments, coordinate regulatory examinations and regulatory findings remediation, support regulatory discussions on new or proposed products or business initiatives, and advance the public policy objectives of the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n## Reputational Risk\n\nReputational risk is the potential that stakeholder perceptions, whether true or not, regarding the/uni00A0Bank's business practices, actions or inactions, will or may cause a significant decline in the/uni00A0Bank's value, brand, liquidity or customer base, or require costly measures to address.\n\nA company's reputation is a valuable business asset that is essential to optimizing shareholder value and therefore, is constantly at risk. Reputational risk can arise as a consequence of negative perceptions about the/uni00A0Bank's business practices involving any aspect of the/uni00A0Bank's operations and usually involves concerns about business ethics and integrity, competence, or the quality or suitability of products and services. Since all risk categories can have an impact on a company's reputation, reputational risk is not managed in isolation from the/uni00A0Bank's other major risk categories and can ultimately impact its brand, earnings, and capital.\n\n## WHO MANAGES REPUTATIONAL RISK\n\nResponsibility for managing risks to the/uni00A0Bank's reputation ultimately lies with the SET and the executive committees that examine reputational risk as part of their regular mandate. The ERRC is the most senior executive committee for the review of reputational risk matters at TD. The mandate of the ERRC is to oversee the management of reputational risk within the/uni00A0Bank's risk appetite. Its main accountability is to review and assess business and corporate initiatives and activities where significant reputational risk profiles have been identified and escalated. The ERRC also provides a forum for discussion, review, and escalation for non-traditional risks.\n\nAt the same time, every employee and representative of the/uni00A0Bank has a responsibility to contribute in a positive way to the/uni00A0Bank's reputation and the management of reputational risk. This means that every Bank employee is responsible for following ethical practices at all times, complying with applicable policies, legislation, and regulations and are also supporting positive interactions with the/uni00A0Bank's stakeholders. Reputational risk is most effectively managed when everyone at the/uni00A0Bank works continuously to protect and enhance the/uni00A0Bank's reputation.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES REPUTATIONAL RISK\n\nThe Bank's approach to the management of reputational risk combines the experience and knowledge of individual business segments, corporate shared service areas and governance, risk and oversight functions. It is based on enabling the/uni00A0Bank's businesses to understand their risks and developing the policies, processes, and controls required to manage these risks appropriately and in line with the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and reputational risk appetite. The Bank's Reputational Risk Management Framework provides a comprehensive overview of its approach to the management of this risk. Amongst other significant policies, the/uni00A0Bank's Enterprise Reputational Risk Management Policy is approved by the Group Head and CRO and sets out the requirements under which business segments and corporate shared services are required to manage reputational risk. These requirements include implementing procedures and designating a business-level committee (where required by the Policy) to review and assess reputational risks and escalation to the ERRC as appropriate.\n\nThe Bank also has an enterprise-wide New Business and Product Approval (NBPA) Policy that is approved by the CRO and establishes standard practices to support consistent processes for approving new businesses, products, and services across the/uni00A0Bank. The policy is supported by business segment specific processes, which involve independent review from oversight functions, and consideration of all aspects of a new product, including reputational risk.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental and Social Risk\n\nEnvironmental and social (E&S) risk is the risk of financial loss, reputational damage or other harm resulting from the/uni00A0Bank's inability to manage and respond to changing environmental or social factors, including climate change, that impact or are associated with the/uni00A0Bank's operations, business activities, products, clients, or the communities the/uni00A0Bank operates in.\n\nManagement of E&S risk is an enterprise-wide priority. Drivers of E&S risk are often multi-faceted and can originate from the/uni00A0Bank, including from its operations and investments, business activities, E&S related commitments and products as well as from its clients, colleagues, suppliers, communities in which the/uni00A0Bank operates, or other stakeholders. These risks can also materialize because of society's transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## WHO MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK\n\nE&S risk and the/uni00A0Bank's ESG strategy is managed within a governance structure that balances broad engagement across the organization while also providing line-of-sight accountability. The Board and senior executives oversee E&S risk and assess and manage potential impacts on the/uni00A0Bank's business strategies and financial performance. The Board continues to oversee E&S risk as a top and emerging risk for the/uni00A0Bank and receives periodic updates on the/uni00A0Bank's progress on E&S matters.\n\nThe Bank's various business-specific and enterprise risk committees provide oversight of, and support management accountability for existing and emerging E&S risks relevant to the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe ESG Senior Executive Team Forum, composed of senior executives from TD's business and corporate segments, provides oversight of ESG and climate strategy development.\n\nThe Senior Vice President, Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship, leads the/uni00A0Bank's ESG and Corporate Citizenship strategy and holds senior executive accountability for the/uni00A0Bank's E&S strategy. The Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship team supports the development of the/uni00A0Bank's ESG strategy by engaging teams across the/uni00A0Bank to develop new products and services, and by setting and reporting performance, standards, and targets.\n\nThe Bank has established a dedicated ESG Risk Management team aligning the E&S Risk Management, ESG Credit Risk and ESG Central Office teams under the leadership of the newly created role of Senior Vice President, ESG Risk Management, who holds senior executive accountability for E&S risk management. The Bank's E&S Risk Management team has E&S risk oversight accountabilities, and establishes risk frameworks, policies, processes and governance structures to identify, assess, control, monitor and report on E&S risks, including climate risk. The ESG Credit Risk team is responsible for developing tools and controls to identify, monitor and manage E&S risk, including climate risk, within the/uni00A0Bank's lending activities, at both the borrower and portfolio levels, in alignment with the Enterprise E&S Risk Framework. The ESG Central Office team leads work to develop the/uni00A0Bank's Climate Target Operating Model and related implementation plan. The Bank has established frameworks, policies, and processes to embed evolving E&S risk management accountabilities into governance structures, business and corporate segments and to assess, report and, where necessary, escalate E&S risks.\n\nBusiness and Corporate Segments are responsible to identify, own and manage E&S risks within their respective areas. This includes incorporating E&S risk assessments into governance and business-as-usual processes, including in relation to new clients, transactions, and positions.\n\n## HOW TD MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK\n\nThe Bank manages E&S risk through the Enterprise E&S Risk Framework which provides a comprehensive overview of the/uni00A0Bank's approach to E&S risk management and defines key pillars of activities for managing E&S risk. This Framework is further supported by business segment level policies and procedures across the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe E&S Risk Policy for Non-Retail Credit Business Lines defines the requirements for identifying and assessing E&S risk within the/uni00A0Bank's non-retail direct lending portfolios. The Policy includes a set of due diligence tools that are applied, where material, to all non-retail direct lending activities, which include general-corporate-purpose, project, and fixed asset financing. This process includes assessment of the/uni00A0Bank's clients' policies, procedures, and performance on significant E&S issues, such as climate-related risks; air, land, and water risk; biodiversity; stakeholder engagement; and the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous Peoples. The Bank also assesses borrower activities against the/uni00A0Bank's Positions and List of Prohibited Transactions, both at the enterprise and business segment level. E&S risk management concepts and training are embedded in various learning modules or portals available across the/uni00A0Bank. Additionally, curated sessions have been provided to various executive-level risk committees and to the Board to bring greater awareness and understanding of E&S risks, and of the/uni00A0Bank's approach to managing these risks.\n\nThe Bank also continues to assess the impacts associated with material changes made to TD products, services, projects, and initiatives by incorporating E&S risks into the/uni00A0Bank's Change Risk Management Framework. Additionally, the/uni00A0Bank's enterprise-wide Business Continuity and Crisis Management Program continues to support management's ability to operate the/uni00A0Bank's businesses and operations in the event of a business disruption incident, including arising from a climate-related event.\n\nThe Bank's E&S metrics, targets and performance are publicly reported within its annual ESG Report and its annual report on Climate Action. Key performance measures are reported in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the FSB's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, with select metrics that are independently assured.\n\n## Climate Risk\n\nClimate risk is the risk of reputational damage and/or financial loss arising from materialized credit, market, operational or other risks resulting from the physical and transition risks of climate change to the/uni00A0Bank, its clients or the communities the/uni00A0Bank operates in. These include physical risks related to the chronic and acute physical impacts of climate change, as well as transition risks associated with the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Each of these risks can materialize in credit, market, operational or other risks. In its 2021 Climate Action Plan: Report on Progress and Update on TCFD, the/uni00A0Bank highlighted the progress on its Climate Action Plan (CAP), as well as its efforts toward implementing the FSB's TCFD recommendations, which provide guidance on using a more consistent approach to assessing and reporting climaterelated risks and opportunities. The Bank is working towards addressing the recommendations of the TCFD and intends to continue building its expertise and capabilities for managing climate-related risks and opportunities. In 2022, the/uni00A0Bank joined the Risk Management Association (RMA) Climate Risk Consortium, which focuses on bringing financial institutions together to create guidelines for embedding climate-related risk management practices throughout the three lines of defence and preparing the financial industry to help economies transition to a lowcarbon future.\n\nThe Bank contributes to public consultations on emerging climate issues, including disclosure frameworks proposed by regulators and industry groups. The Bank also actively engages with environmental and community NGOs, industry associations, rating agencies and responsible investment organizations.",

        "page_content": "TD also participates in various North American working groups, and as a member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), helps to develop and refine calculation methodologies for emerging climate metrics. In 2020, the/uni00A0Bank announced a target to achieve netzero GHG emissions associated with the/uni00A0Bank's operations and financing activities by 2050, in alignment with the associated principles of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, the/uni00A0Bank joined the United Nations Environment Program Finance's Initiative Net-Zero Banking Alliance (UNEP/uni00A0FI's NZBA), a/uni00A0global, industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change and help facilitate the transition to a lowcarbon economy. Subsequently, the/uni00A0Bank announced an interim target to achieve an/uni00A0absolute reduction in GHG emissions from the/uni00A0Bank's operations (Scope/uni00A01 and 2 GHG emissions) by 25% by 2025, relative to a 2019 baseline. In March 2022, the/uni00A0Bank disclosed emissions associated with/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's financed portfolio for two carbon-intensive sectors (Energy/uni00A0and Power Generation) and also set NZBA-aligned interim (2030) Scope 3 financed emissions targets for these sectors.\n\nThe Bank monitors and assesses legal, policy, regulatory, economic, technological and stakeholder developments regarding E&S matters, including the transition to net zero, and how those developments may affect its E&S metrics and targets. Accordingly, the/uni00A0Bank may adjust its E&S metrics or targets to reflect these developments. In addition, there could be changes to the E&S methodologies or standards used by regulators, the financial sector, industry groups or associations that the/uni00A0Bank participates in or belongs to, or that the/uni00A0Bank or its clients use to measure and report on their GHG emissions. Any such changes could result in TD amending or restating its GHG emissions baselines, calculated GHG emissions or GHG emission targets, and may result in the/uni00A0Bank withdrawing from or modifying its membership in certain groups or associations. The Bank assesses, and will continue to assess, the potential impacts of climate change and related risks on its operations, lending portfolios, investments, and businesses.\n\nThe Bank is developing methodologies and approaches, including building related tools and capabilities for quantitative measurement for climate scenario analysis, through participation in industry-wide working groups. The Bank is a member of the UNEP FI and, in 2021, participated in the UNEP-FI Lending Pilot (Phase III) working group and the joint Bank of Canada/OSFI Climate Scenario Analysis Pilot. The Bank also conducted a pilot study with Moody's Analytics to help develop harmonized industry-wide methodologies and approaches for climate scenario analysis in bank lending, investments, and insurance portfolios. Through the/uni00A0Bank's participation in scenario analysis pilots, it continues to build its understanding of the transition and physical risks of climate change as well as its internal capabilities regarding climate data and climate-related risk modelling. These studies, and the/uni00A0Bank's participation in industry pilot programs, are steps that help build internal knowledge, tools, and capabilities in future risk identification, and will help inform the/uni00A0Bank's approach as it works to further integrate and manage climate-related risks across the enterprise.\n\nIn 2021, the/uni00A0Bank developed a climate-related risk inventory, including risk definitions, to identify the impacts that climate change may have on the/uni00A0Bank and its assets, clients, and communities in which it operates. The Bank also developed an initial heatmapping framework, supported by an Industry Risk Review process, to support physical and transition climate risk identification and assessment. In 2022, the/uni00A0Bank published its Thermal Coal Position, which outlines the/uni00A0Bank's approach to managing climaterelated risks associated with thermal coal mining and unabated thermal coal power generation.\n\nSince 2008, TDAM has been a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). Under the UN/uni00A0PRI, investors commit to incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making. TDAM has a dedicated ESG Research and Engagement team that supports its Chief Investment Officer and investment function on its Sustainable Investing approach, ESG engagements, stewardship, and proxy voting.\n\nIn 2020, TD Securities (TDS) created a dedicated ESG Solutions group (formerly the Sustainable Finance and Corporate Transitions group), which focuses on the delivery of integrated ESG and climate solutions, including activities such as arranging sustainability-linked loans; underwriting green, social, sustainability, and sustainability linked (GSSS) bonds; and providing ESG advisory, merger and acquisition, and financing services to companies involved in the transition to the low-carbon economy. In 2021, TDS focused on key milestones to support the/uni00A0Bank's CAP and net-zero target, as well as established sustainable financial initiatives that further embed ESG in its business strategies.\n\nSince 2015, TD Insurance (TDI) has been a signatory to the UNEP FI Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), which serve as the global framework for insurance companies to develop an understanding of the opportunities to address E&S risks, including climate risk. To further the integration of ESG into its decision-making, TDI established the TDI Executive Sustainability Governance Committee, comprised of leaders from across TDI who work to embed the PSI and ESG considerations into its operational framework. In 2019, TDI established its Advisory Board on Climate Change, comprised of experts from Engineers Canada and six top Canadian universities with expertise in fields related to climate change, severe weather and its impact on people and the planet. The Advisory Board, together with TDI executives, is focusing its efforts on two/uni00A0activities: addressing flood risk, and resilience and homeowner education. Climate risk considerations are embedded within TDI's General Insurance Catastrophe and Reinsurance Policy and TDI's Risk Appetite Statement. TDI also evaluates potential impacts and recommends mitigation with respect to climate-related insurance losses through a newly established TDI/uni00A0Climate Risk Appetite Task Force.\n\n## Codes of Conduct and Human Rights\n\nThe Bank has several policies, including the/uni00A0Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics that reflect the/uni00A0Bank's commitment to manage its business responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws. For additional information on the Code of Conduct and Ethics, refer to the 'Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk' section above. The Bank first released a Statement on Human Rights in 2020, which reflects the corporate responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). The Statement is updated, as necessary, to demonstrate progress on the/uni00A0Bank's commitment. The Bank also has policies, due diligence processes, and training practices in place to manage the risks of slavery and human trafficking in its business activities. The Bank publicly reports under the United Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015 through the/uni00A0Bank's annual Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, and Toronto Dominion (Southeast Asia) Limited publicly reports under Australia's Modern Slavery Act 2018 .\n\nThe Bank's Supplier Code of Conduct also reflects its commitment to respect human rights. When registering suppliers, the/uni00A0Bank requires that suppliers confirm that they operate in accordance with the expectations described in the/uni00A0Bank's Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes the protection of human rights. The Bank may apply enhanced due diligence on parts of its supply chain that are most relevant for ESG issues. The Bank's North American Supplier Diversity Program seeks to promote a level playing field and encourage the inclusion of women; Black, Indigenous, and other minority groups; the 2SLGBTQ+ community; people with disabilities; veterans; and other diverse groups in its procurement process. To reflect this goal, in 2021, the/uni00A0Bank's Chief Procurement Officer released a Statement on Supplier Diversity, recognizing diversity and inclusion as both a core value and a business imperative.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe Bank is devoted to advancing its diversity and inclusion strategy to build a more inclusive and diverse culture at the/uni00A0Bank. In 2022, the/uni00A0Bank announced that it would engage a third-party law firm to conduct a racial equity assessment of the/uni00A0Bank's Canadian and U.S. employment policies. This work will be overseen by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POLICIES\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe Bank's accounting policies and estimates are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. A summary of the/uni00A0Bank's significant accounting policies and estimates are presented in the Notes of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank's critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. Critical accounting policies that require management's judgment and estimates include the classification and measurement of financial assets, accounting for impairments of financial assets, accounting for leases, the determination of fair value of financial instruments, accounting for derecognition, the valuation of goodwill and other intangibles, accounting for employee benefits, accounting for income taxes, accounting for provisions, accounting for insurance, the consolidation of structured entities, and accounting for revenue from contract with customers.\n\nThe Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared/uni00A0in accordance with IFRS. For details of the/uni00A0Bank's accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe estimates used in the/uni00A0Bank's accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the/uni00A0Bank's policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner.\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Business Model Assessment\n\nThe Bank determines its business models based on the objective under which its portfolios of financial assets are managed. Refer to Note 2 of the/uni00A0Bank's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the/uni00A0Bank's business models. In determining its business models, the/uni00A0Bank considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management's intent and strategic objectives and the operation of the stated policies in practice;\n- \u00b7 The primary risks that affect the performance of the portfolio of assets and how these risks are managed;\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to management; and\n- \u00b7 The frequency and significance of financial asset sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and the expected future sales activities.\n\nSales in themselves do not determine the business model and are not considered in isolation. Instead, sales provide evidence about how cash flows are realized. A held-to-collect business model will be reassessed by the/uni00A0Bank to determine whether any sales are consistent with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows if the sales are more than insignificant in value or more than infrequent.\n\n## Solely Payments of Principal and Interest Test\n\nIn assessing whether contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), the/uni00A0Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that they would not be consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In making the assessment, the/uni00A0Bank considers the primary terms as follows and assesses if the contractual cash flows of the instrument continue to meet the SPPI test:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance-linked features;\n- \u00b7 Terms that limit the/uni00A0Bank's claim to cash flows from specified assets (non-recourse terms);\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms;\n- \u00b7 Leverage features; and\n- \u00b7 Features that modify elements of the time value of money.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nFor retail exposures, criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate product or portfolio level and vary based on the exposure's credit risk at origination. The criteria include relative changes in PD, absolute PD backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met.\n\nFor non-retail exposures, BRR is determined on an individual borrower basis using industry and sector specific credit risk models that are based on historical data. Current and forward-looking information that is specific to the borrower, industry, and sector is considered based on expert credit judgment. Criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate segmentation level and vary based on the BRR of the exposure at origination. Criteria include relative changes in BRR, absolute BRR backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met.\n\n## Measurement of Expected Credit Loss\n\nECLs are recognized on the initial recognition of financial assets. Allowance for credit losses represents management's unbiased estimate of the risk of default and ECLs on the financial assets, including any offbalance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date.\n\nFor retail exposures, ECLs are calculated as the product of PD, LGD, and EAD at each time step over the remaining expected life of the financial asset and discounted to the reporting date based on the EIR. PD estimates represent the forward-looking PD, updated quarterly based on the/uni00A0Bank's historical experience, current conditions, and relevant forward-looking expectations over the expected life of the exposure to determine the lifetime PD curve. LGD estimates are determined based on historical charge-off events and recovery payments, current information about attributes specific to the borrower, and direct costs. Expected cash flows from collateral, guarantees, and other credit enhancements are incorporated in LGD if integral to the contractual terms. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected LGD. EAD represents the expected balance at default across the remaining expected life of the exposure. EAD incorporates forward-looking expectations about repayments of drawn balances and future draws where applicable.",

        "page_content": "For non-retail exposures, ECLs are calculated based on the present value of cash shortfalls determined as the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. Lifetime PD is determined by mapping the exposure's BRR to forward-looking PD over the expected life. LGD estimates are determined by mapping the exposure's FRR to expected LGD which takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, and loan structure. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected PD and LGD. Expected cash flows are determined by applying the expected LGD to the contractual cash flows to calculate cash shortfalls over the expected life of the exposure.\n\n## Forward-Looking Information\n\nIn calculating ECLs, the/uni00A0Bank employs internally developed models that utilize parameters for PD, LGD, and EAD. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors including at the regional level are incorporated in the risk parameters as relevant. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are generated by TD Economics as part of the ECL process: A base economic forecast is accompanied with upside and downside estimates of realistically possible economic conditions by considering the sources of uncertainty around the base forecast. All macroeconomic forecasts are updated quarterly for each variable on a regional basis where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the quarterly modelling of base, upside and downside risk parameters used in the calculation of ECL scenarios and probability weighted ECLs. TD/uni00A0Economics will apply judgment to recommend probability weights to each forecast on a quarterly basis. The proposed macroeconomic forecasts and probability weightings are subject to robust management review and challenge process by a cross-functional committee that includes representation from TD/uni00A0Economics, Risk, Finance, and Business. ECLs calculated under each of the three forecasts are applied against the respective probability-weightings to determine the probabilityweighted ECLs. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the macroeconomic variables and ECL sensitivity.\n\n## Expert Credit Judgment\n\nManagement's expert credit judgment is used to determine the best estimate for the qualitative component contributing to ECLs, based on an assessment of business and economic conditions, historical loss experience, loan portfolio composition, and other relevant indicators and forward-looking information that are not fully incorporated into the model calculation.\n\nThere remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied.\n\n## LEASES\n\nThe Bank applies judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. All facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not to exercise a termination option including investments in major leaseholds, branch performance and past business practice are considered. The periods covered by renewal or termination options are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the/uni00A0Bank will exercise the options; management considers 'reasonably certain' to be a high threshold. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the industry may impact the/uni00A0Bank's assessment of lease term, and any changes in the/uni00A0Bank's estimate of lease terms may have a material impact on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nIn determining the carrying amount of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, the/uni00A0Bank is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The Bank determines the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset or portfolio of leased\n\nassets by incorporating the/uni00A0Bank's creditworthiness, the security, term, and value of the ROU asset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental borrowing rates are subject to change mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is based on their quoted market prices. For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions involving the same or similar instruments, without modification or repackaging, or is based on a valuation technique which maximizes the use of observable market inputs. Observable market inputs may include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and option volatilities. Valuation techniques include comparisons with similar instruments where observable market prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.\n\nFor certain complex or illiquid financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques in which current market transactions or observable market inputs are not available. Judgment is/uni00A0used when determining which valuation techniques to apply, liquidity considerations, and model inputs such as volatilities, correlations, spreads, discount rates, pre-payment rates, and prices of underlying instruments. Any imprecision in these estimates can affect the resulting fair value.\n\nJudgment is also used in recording valuation adjustments to model fair values to account for system limitations or measurement uncertainty, such as when valuing complex and less actively traded financial instruments. If the market for a complex financial instrument develops, the pricing for this instrument may become more transparent, resulting in refinement of valuation models. For example, IBOR reform may also have an impact on the fair value of products that reference or use valuation models with IBOR inputs.\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nCertain financial assets transferred may qualify for derecognition from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. To qualify for derecognition, certain key determinations must be made, including whether the/uni00A0Bank's rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have been retained or transferred and the extent to which the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets have been retained or transferred. If the/uni00A0Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, a decision must be made as to whether the/uni00A0Bank has retained control of the financial assets.\n\nUpon derecognition, the/uni00A0Bank will record a gain or loss on sale of those assets which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, including any financial assets received or financial liabilities assumed, and any cumulative gains or losses allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. In determining the fair value of any financial assets received, the/uni00A0Bank estimates future cash flows by relying on estimates of the amount of interest that will be collected on the securitized assets, the yield to be paid to investors, the portion of the securitized assets that will be prepaid before their scheduled maturity, ECLs, the cost of servicing the assets, and the rate at which to discount these expected future cash flows. Actual cash flows may differ significantly from those estimated by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nRetained interests are financial interests in transferred assets retained by the/uni00A0Bank. They are classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at relative fair value on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the/uni00A0Bank's estimated future cash flows are recognized in trading income (loss). These assumptions are subject to periodic reviews and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment.",

    {
        "page_content": "## GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\n\nThe recoverable amount of the/uni00A0Bank's cash-generating units (CGUs) is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as forecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compared to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the/uni00A0Bank's CGUs are determined by management using riskbased capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). Any capital not directly attributable to the CGUs is held within the Corporate segment. The Bank's capital oversight committees provide oversight to the/uni00A0Bank's capital allocation methodologies.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nThe projected benefit obligation and expense related to the/uni00A0Bank's pension and post-retirement defined benefit plans are determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts. Actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates are management's best estimates and are reviewed annually with the/uni00A0Bank's actuaries. The Bank develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the/uni00A0Bank in conjunction with market-related data and considers if the marketrelated data indicates there is any prolonged or significant impact on the assumptions. The discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans' specific cash flows. The other assumptions are also long-term estimates. All assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Differences between actual experiences and the assumptions, as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations, result in remeasurement gains and losses which are recognized in other comprehensive income during the year and also impact expenses in future periods.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nThe Bank is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations in the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute, or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. These provisions are made using the/uni00A0Bank's best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date, changes in these liabilities could result from audits by the relevant taxing authorities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. The amount of the deferred tax asset recognized and considered realizable could, however, be reduced if projected income is not achieved due to various factors, such as unfavourable business conditions. If projected income is not expected to be achieved, the/uni00A0Bank would decrease its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes can be realized. The magnitude of the decrease is significantly influenced by the/uni00A0Bank's forecast of future profit generation, which determines the extent to which it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets.\n\n## PROVISIONS\n\nProvisions arise when there is some uncertainty in the timing or amount of a loss in the future. Provisions are based on the/uni00A0Bank's best estimate of all expenditures required to settle its present obligations, considering all relevant risks and uncertainties, as well as, when material, the effect of the time value of money.\n\nMany of the/uni00A0Bank's provisions relate to various legal actions that the/uni00A0Bank is involved in during the ordinary course of business. Legal provisions require the involvement of both the/uni00A0Bank's management and legal counsel when assessing the probability of a loss and estimating any monetary impact. Throughout the life of a provision, the/uni00A0Bank's management or legal counsel may learn of additional information that may impact its assessments about the probability of loss or about the estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts recognized. The Bank reviews its legal provisions on a caseby-case basis after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the/uni00A0Bank's experience, the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\n\nCertain of the/uni00A0Bank's provisions relate to restructuring initiatives initiated by the/uni00A0Bank. Restructuring provisions require management's best estimate, including forecasts of economic conditions. Throughout the life of a provision, the/uni00A0Bank may become aware of additional information that may impact the assessment of amounts to be incurred. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\nThe assumptions used in establishing the/uni00A0Bank's insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes.\n\nFor property and casualty insurance, the ultimate cost of claims liabilities is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved.\n\nFor life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION OF STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nManagement judgment is required when assessing whether the/uni00A0Bank should consolidate an entity. For instance, it may not be feasible to determine if the/uni00A0Bank controls an entity solely through an assessment of voting rights for certain structured entities. In these cases, judgment is required to establish whether the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power over the key relevant activities of the entity and whether the/uni00A0Bank has the ability to use that power to absorb significant variable returns from the entity. If it is determined that the/uni00A0Bank has both decision-making power and significant variable returns from the entity, judgment is also used to determine whether any such power is exercised by the/uni00A0Bank as principal, on its own behalf, or as agent, on behalf of another counterparty.\n\nAssessing whether the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power includes understanding the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine its key economic activities. In this context, an entity's key economic activities are those which predominantly impact the economic performance of the entity. When the/uni00A0Bank has the current ability to direct the entity's key economic activities, it is considered to have decisionmaking power over the entity.",

As part of this evaluation, the/uni00A0Bank considers the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine whether it absorbs variable returns from the structured entity through its contractual holdings, which may take the form of securities issued by the entity, derivatives with the entity, or other arrangements such as guarantees, liquidity facilities, or lending commitments.\n\nIf the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power over the entity and absorbs significant variable returns from the entity, it then determines if it is acting as principal or agent when exercising its decision-making power. Key factors considered include the scope of its decision-making power; the rights of other parties involved with the entity, including any rights to remove the/uni00A0Bank as decision-maker or rights to participate in key decisions; whether the rights of other parties are exercisable in practice; and the variable returns absorbed by the/uni00A0Bank and by other parties involved with the entity. When assessing consolidation, a presumption exists that the/uni00A0Bank exercises decision-making power as principal if it is also exposed to significant variable returns, unless an analysis of the factors above indicates otherwise.\n\nThe decisions above are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances relevant for the structured entity and related transaction(s) under consideration.\n\n## REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nThe Bank applies judgment to determine the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations which affects the timing of revenue recognition, by evaluating the pattern in which the/uni00A0Bank transfers control of services promised to the customer. A performance obligation is satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the/uni00A0Bank performs the service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is generally recognized using the time-elapsed method which is based on time elapsed in proportion to the period over which the service is provided, for example, personal deposit account bundle fees. The time-elapsed method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of control for these services as control is transferred evenly to the customer when the/uni00A0Bank provides a stand-ready service or effort is expended evenly by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank to provide a service over the contract period. In contracts where the/uni00A0Bank has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the/uni00A0Bank's performance completed to date, the/uni00A0Bank recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice.\n\nThe Bank satisfies a performance obligation at a point in time if the customer obtains control of the promised services at that date. Determining when control is transferred requires the use of judgment. For transaction-based services, the/uni00A0Bank determines that control is transferred to the customer at a point in time when the customer obtains substantially all of the benefits from the service rendered and the/uni00A0Bank has a present right to payment, which generally coincides with the moment the transaction is executed.\n\nThe Bank exercises judgment in determining whether costs incurred in connection with acquiring new revenue contracts would meet the requirement to be capitalized as incremental costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with customers.\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM PHASE 2\n\nEffective November 1, 2020, the/uni00A0Bank early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 and no transitional adjustment was required.\n\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 addresses issues affecting financial reporting when changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial instruments or hedging relationships as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments permit modification to financial assets, financial liabilities and lessee lease liabilities required as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the EIR prospectively. If the modification does not meet the practical expedient requirements, existing IFRS requirements are applied. Relief is also provided for an entity's hedge accounting relationships in circumstances where changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments enable entities to amend\n\nthe formal designation and documentation of a hedging relationship to reflect these changes without discontinuing the hedging relationship or designating a new hedging relationship. Permitted changes include redefining the hedged risk to reference an ARR (contractually or noncontractually specified), amending the description of the hedged item and hedging instrument to reflect the ARR, and amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Hedging relationships within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 are the same as those within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 also amended IFRS 7, introducing expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the risks arising from IBOR reform, how an entity is managing those risks, its progress in completing the transition to ARRs, and how it is managing the transition.\n\nThe global benchmark rate reform initiative to transition from IBOR benchmarks (such as London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) to ARRs may result in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the/uni00A0Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry. Market risks arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the existing benchmark rates which could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require alternative hedging strategies, or affect the/uni00A0Bank's capital and liquidity planning and management. In order to manage these risks, the/uni00A0Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks.\n\nEffective December 31, 2021, the publication of LIBOR settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro settings as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings. The Bank is progressing on its transition plan for the remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, onemonth, three-month, six-month and twelve-month), which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023, and continues to monitor developments while incorporating global working group and regulator best practice guidance on transition activities. Global regulators have issued guidance and policy statements to supervised institutions restricting the use of USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts written after December 31, 2021, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs across the industry, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee's formal recommendation of the CME Group's forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Term Rates. To help support the transition of legacy derivative contracts, the/uni00A0Bank's registered swap dealer and four additional Bank affiliates have adhered to the 2020 International Swaps and Derivatives Association IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (ISDA Protocol). The ISDA Protocol, which took effect on January 25, 2021, provides an efficient transition mechanism for mutually adhering counterparties to incorporate prescribed fallback rates into legacy derivative contracts.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, the administrator of CDOR, announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. CDOR is currently the primary interest rate benchmark in Canada and is widely used in Canadian dollar financial instruments including derivatives, loans, floating rate notes, and as a daily benchmark reference rate for Canadian Bankers' Acceptance (BA) borrowings. The Bank has incorporated this development into its benchmark rate reform plan to ensure an orderly transition and to manage the impact through appropriate mitigating actions. These actions include incorporating appropriate fallback language in contracts, making available new products referencing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or other ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy CDOR-based contracts, and preparing for overall operational readiness.",

Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POLICIES\n\n## Controls and Procedures\n\n## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the/uni00A0Bank's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the rules of the SEC and Canadian Securities Administrators, as of October/uni00A031, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the/uni00A0Bank's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the/uni00A0Bank's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the/uni00A0Bank. The Bank's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the/uni00A0Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of the/uni00A0Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the/uni00A0Bank's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the/uni00A0Bank's assets that could/uni00A0have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nThe standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the/uni00A0Bank. OSFI's related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the/uni00A0Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe Bank is proceeding with implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and other implementation efforts accordingly.\n\nThe Bank's management has used the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as at October/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the applicable criteria. The effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting has been audited by the independent auditors, Ernst/uni00A0&/uni00A0Young/uni00A0LLP, a registered public accounting firm that has also audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the/uni00A0Bank as of, and for/uni00A0the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022. Their Report on Internal Controls under Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of October/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nDuring the year and quarter ended October/uni00A031, 2022, there have been no changes in the/uni00A0Bank's policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting.",

        "page_content": "## GLOSSARY\n\n## Financial and Banking Terms\n\nAdjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank's businesses and to measure the Bank's overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for 'items of note', from reported results. The/uni00A0items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and offbalance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange.\n\nAmortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment.\n\nAssets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as/uni00A0the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of/uni00A0the/uni00A0clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank's Consolidated Balance/uni00A0Sheet.\n\nAssets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are/uni00A0included in assets under administration.\n\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) : A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains.\n\nAsset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments/uni00A0are/uni00A0derived from and collateralized (or 'backed') by a specified pool/uni00A0of/uni00A0underlying assets.\n\nAverage Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank's methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III.\n\nAverage Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank's financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year.\n\nBasic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income.\n\nBasis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to/uni00A0100 basis points.\n\nBook Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders' equity by number of common shares at the end of the period.\n\nCarrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs.\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances.\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA.\n\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period.\n\nCredit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios.\n\nDiluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income.\n\nDividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank's earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income.\n\nDividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year.\n\nEffective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results.\n\nEffective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts.\n\nEffective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument's book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument.\n\nEfficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A/uni00A0lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue.\n\nEnhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF): Established by the Financial Stability Board in May 2012, comprised of banks, analysts, investors, and auditors, with the goal of enhancing the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions.\n\nExpected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank's credit risk assessment.\n\nFair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions.",

        "page_content": "Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it/uni00A0is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at/uni00A0FVOCI.\n\nFair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss.\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor's accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks).\n\nForward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date.\n\nFutures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date.\n\nHedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions.\n\nImpaired Loans: Loans where, in management's opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest.\n\nLoss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of/uni00A0exposure at default.\n\nMark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value.\n\nMaster Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract.\n\nNet Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment.\n\nNet Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance.

Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income.\n\nNon-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares/uni00A0or/uni00A0fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is/uni00A0no/uni00A0longer viable.\n\nNotional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based.\n\n## Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI):\n\nThe/uni00A0regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans.\n\nOptions: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by/uni00A0a specified future date.\n\nPrice-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS/uni00A0based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS.\n\nProbability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio.\n\nReturn on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders' equity, utilized in assessing the Bank's use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income.\n\nReturn on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets.\n\nReturn on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank's use of equity.\n\nRisk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory riskweight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a/uni00A0comparable risk level.\n\nSecuritization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans.\n\nSolely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost:\n\n- \u00b7 The entity's business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its/uni00A0contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 An asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nSwaps: Contracts that involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payment obligations and currencies on a notional principal for a specified period of time.\n\nTangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders' equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank's use of equity.\n\nTaxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax-exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.\n\nTier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders' equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA.\n\nTotal Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR): The total return earned on an investment in TD's common shares. The return measures the change in shareholder value, assuming dividends paid are reinvested in additional shares.\n\nTrading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment is also a/uni00A0non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance.\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time.",

International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as well as the requirements of the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada), and related regulations have been applied and management has exercised its judgment and made best estimates where appropriate.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's accounting system and related internal controls are designed, and supporting procedures maintained, to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are complete and accurate, and that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. These supporting procedures include the careful selection and training of qualified staff, the establishment of organizational structures providing a well-defined division of responsibilities and accountability for performance, and the communication of policies and guidelines of business conduct throughout the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting as at October/uni00A031, 2022, using the framework found in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework. Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that as at October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, oversees management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews the Consolidated Financial Statements and recommends them to the Board for approval. Other responsibilities of the Audit Committee include monitoring the/uni00A0Bank's system of internal control over the financial reporting process and making recommendations to the Board and shareholders regarding the appointment of the external auditor.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's Chief Auditor, who has full and free access to the Audit Committee, conducts an extensive program of audits. This program supports the system of internal control and is carried out by a professional staff of auditors.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, makes such examination and enquiry into the affairs of the/uni00A0Bank as deemed necessary to ensure that the provisions of the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada), having reference to the safety of the depositors, are being duly observed and that the/uni00A0Bank is in sound financial condition.\n\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent auditors appointed by the shareholders of the/uni00A0Bank, have audited the effectiveness of the/uni00A0Bank's internal control over financial reporting as at October/uni00A031, 2022, in addition to auditing the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements as of the same date. Their reports, which expressed an unqualified opinion, can be found on the following pages of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ernst & Young LLP have full and free access to, and meet periodically with, the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and matters arising therefrom, such as, comments they may have on the fairness of financial reporting and the adequacy of internal controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bharat B.

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\n## To the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of The TorontoDominion Bank and its subsidiaries (TD) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021, and the Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements').\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TD as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of TD in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial state ments in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nKey audit matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the allowance for credit losses in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements, TD recognized $7,366/uni00A0million in allowances for credit losses on its consolidated balance sheet using an expected credit loss model (ECL). The ECL is an unbiased and probabilityweighted estimate of credit losses expected to occur in the future, which is based on the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) or the expected cash shortfall relating to the underlying financial asset. The ECL is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes incorporating the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and future economic forecasts. ECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\nAuditing the allowance for credit losses was complex and required the application of significant judgment and involvement of specialists because of the sophistication of the models, the forward-looking nature of the key assumptions, and the inherent interrelationship of the critical variables used in measuring the ECL. Key areas of judgment include evaluating: (i) the models and methodologies used for measuring both the 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses; (ii) the assumptions used in the ECL scenarios including forward-looking information (FLI) and assigning probability weighting; (iii) the determination of SICR; and (iv) the assessment of the qualitative component applied to the modelled ECL based on management's expert credit judgment.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the allowance for credit losses. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the development and validation of models and selection of appropriate inputs including economic forecasting, determination of non-retail borrower risk ratings, the integrity of the data used including the associated controls over relevant information technology (IT) systems, and the governance and oversight over the modelled results and the use of expert credit judgment.\n\nTo test the allowance for credit losses, our audit procedures included, amongst others, involving our credit risk specialists to assess whether the methodology and assumptions, including management's SICR triggers, used in significant models that estimate the ECL across various portfolios are consistent with the requirements of IFRS. This included reperforming the model validation procedures for a sample of models to evaluate whether management's conclusions were appropriate. With the assistance of our economic specialists, we evaluated the models, methodology and process used by management to develop the FLI variable forecasts for each scenario and the scenario probability weights. For a sample of FLI variables, we compared management's FLI to independently derived forecasts and publicly available information. On a sample basis, we recalculated the ECL to test the mathematical accuracy of management's models. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used in measuring the ECL by agreeing to source documents and systems and evaluated a sample of management's non-retail borrower risk ratings against TD's risk rating policy. With the assistance of our credit risk specialists, we also evaluated management's methodology and governance over the application of expert credit judgment by evaluating that the amounts recorded were reflective of underlying credit quality and macroeconomic trends. We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Fair value measurement of derivatives\n\nKey audit matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the fair value measurement of derivatives in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A05 of the consolidated financial statements, TD has derivative assets of $103,873/uni00A0million and derivative liabilities of $91,133/uni00A0million recorded at fair value. Certain of these derivatives are complex and illiquid and require valuation techniques that may include complex models and nonobservable inputs, requiring management's estimation and judgment.\n\nAuditing the valuation of certain derivatives required the application of significant auditor judgment and involvement of valuation specialists in assessing the complex models and non-observable inputs used, including any significant valuation adjustments applied. Certain valuation inputs used to determine fair value that may be non-observable include volatilities, correlations, and credit spreads. The valuation of certain derivatives is sensitive to these inputs as they are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls, including the associated controls over relevant IT systems, over the valuation of TD's derivative portfolio. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the suitability and mechanical accuracy of models used in the valuation of derivatives, controls over management's",

        "page_content": "independent assessment of fair values, including the integrity of data used in the valuation such as the significant inputs noted above, and controls over the review of significant valuation adjustments applied.\n\nTo test the valuation of these derivatives, our audit procedures included, amongst others, an evaluation of the methodologies and significant inputs used by TD. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we performed an independent valuation for a sample of derivatives to assess the modelling assumptions and significant inputs used to estimate the fair value, which involved obtaining significant inputs from independent external sources. For a sample of valuation adjustments, we utilized the assistance of our valuation specialists to evaluate the methodology applied and performed a recalculation of these adjustments. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the fair value measurement of derivatives.\n\n## Valuation of provision for unpaid claims\n\nKey audit matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the valuation of provisions for unpaid claims in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A022 to the consolidated financial statements, TD has recognized $7,468/uni00A0million in insurance-related liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. The insurance-related liabilities include a provision for unpaid claims, which is determined in accordance with accepted actuarial practices.\n\nAuditing the provision for unpaid claims required the application of significant judgement and involved the use of specialists due to the complex nature of the models, methodologies and assumptions applied in the determination of the provision. Claims liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. The main assumption underlying the estimate of the claims liability is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and therefore ultimate claim costs. Actuarial methods are applied to extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, frequency and severity of claims based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Additional qualitative judgement is applied to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims costs that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the valuation of the provision for unpaid claims including the associated controls over relevant IT systems. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls related to TD's claims and actuarial processes including over the completeness and accuracy of data flow through the claims administration systems, and the overall review of the provision for unpaid claims by management.\n\nWe evaluated the objectivity, independence and expertise of the actuarial valuator appointed by management. To test the valuation for unpaid claims, our audit procedures included, amongst others, involving our actuarial specialists to independently calculate the provision for unpaid claims on a sample basis. This included assessing the accuracy of TD's data by agreeing to source systems on a sample basis and benchmarking the assumptions against industry trends. With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we assessed TD's actuary's methodologies and significant assumptions, including comparing the rationale for the judgments applied against generally accepted actuarial practices. We also performed data integrity testing of incurred claims, paid claims, and earned premiums used in the estimation of the provision for unpaid claims.\n\n## Measurement of provision for uncertain tax positions\n\nKey audit matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to income taxes in Note/uni00A03 and Note/uni00A025 of the consolidated financial statements. As a financial institution operating in multiple jurisdictions, TD is subject to complex and constantly evolving tax legislation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. TD uses significant judgment in i) determining whether it is probable that TD will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon\n\ntheir examination of certain uncertain tax positions and ii) measuring the amount of the liability.\n\nAuditing TD's provision for uncertain tax positions involved the application of judgment and is based on interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over TD's provision for uncertain tax positions. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management's process to measure the provision for uncertain tax positions.\n\nWith the assistance of our tax professionals, we assessed the technical merits and the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, using our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate TD's interpretations and assessment of tax laws with respect to uncertain tax positions. We assessed the implications of correspondence received by TD from the relevant tax authorities and evaluated income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Management's Discussion and Analysis; and\n- \u00b7 The information, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe obtained Management's Discussion and Analysis and the 2022 Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor's report. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor's report. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing TD's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate TD or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing TD's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of TD's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on TD's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause TD to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) as of October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity, and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TD as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021, its financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), TD's internal control over financial reporting as of October/uni00A031, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November/uni00A030, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of TD's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on TD's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within TD to express an/uni00A0opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Helen Mitchell.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants\n\nToronto, Canada November/uni00A030,/uni00A02022\n\nindependent with respect to TD in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.",

        "page_content": "## Allowance for credit losses\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the allowance for credit losses in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A08 to the consolidated financial statements, TD recognized $7,366/uni00A0million in allowances for credit losses on its consolidated balance sheet using an expected credit loss model (ECL). The ECL is an unbiased and probabilityweighted estimate of credit losses expected to occur in the future, which is based on the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) or the expected cash shortfall relating to the underlying financial asset. The ECL is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes incorporating the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and future economic forecasts. ECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\nAuditing the allowance for credit losses was complex and required the application of significant judgment and involvement of specialists because of the sophistication of the models, the forward-looking nature of the key assumptions, and the inherent interrelationship of the critical variables used in measuring the ECL. Key areas of judgment include evaluating: (i) the models and methodologies used for measuring both the 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses; (ii) the assumptions used in the ECL scenarios including forward-looking information (FLI) and assigning probability weighting; (iii) the determination of SICR; and (iv) the assessment of the qualitative component applied to the modelled ECL based on management's expert credit judgment.\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the allowance for credit losses. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the development and validation of models and selection of appropriate inputs including economic forecasting, determination of non-retail borrower risk ratings, the integrity of the data used including the associated controls over relevant information technology (IT) systems, and the governance and oversight over the modelled results and the use of expert credit judgment.\n\nTo test the allowance for credit losses, our audit procedures included, amongst others, involving our credit risk specialists to assess whether the methodology and assumptions, including management's SICR triggers, used in significant models that estimate the ECL across various portfolios are consistent with the requirements of IFRS. This included reperforming the model validation procedures for a sample of models to evaluate whether management's conclusions were appropriate. With the assistance of our economic specialists, we evaluated the models, methodology and process used by management to develop the FLI variable forecasts for each scenario and the scenario probability weights. For a sample of FLI variables, we compared management's FLI to independently derived forecasts and publicly available information. On a sample basis, we recalculated the ECL to test the mathematical accuracy of management's models. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used in measuring the ECL by agreeing to source documents and systems and evaluated a sample of management's non-retail borrower risk ratings against TD's risk rating policy. With the assistance of our credit risk specialists, we also evaluated management's methodology and governance over the application of expert credit judgment by evaluating that the amounts recorded were reflective of underlying credit quality and macroeconomic trends. We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Fair value measurement of derivatives\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the fair value measurement of derivatives in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A05 of the consolidated financial statements, TD has derivative assets of\n\n$103,873/uni00A0million and derivative liabilities of $91,133/uni00A0million recorded at fair value. Certain of these derivatives are complex and illiquid and require valuation techniques that may include complex models and nonobservable inputs, requiring management's estimation and judgment.\n\nAuditing the valuation of certain derivatives required the application of significant auditor judgment and involvement of valuation specialists in assessing the complex models and non-observable inputs used, including any significant valuation adjustments applied. Certain valuation inputs used to determine fair value that may be non-observable include volatilities, correlations, and credit spreads. The valuation of certain derivatives is sensitive to these inputs as they are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls, including the associated controls over relevant IT systems, over the valuation of TD's derivative portfolio. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the suitability and mechanical accuracy of models used in the valuation of derivatives, controls over management's independent assessment of fair values, including the integrity of data used in the valuation such as the significant inputs noted above, and controls over the review of significant valuation adjustments applied.\n\nTo test the valuation of these derivatives, our audit procedures included, amongst others, an evaluation of the methodologies and significant inputs used by TD. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we performed an independent valuation for a sample of derivatives to assess the modelling assumptions and significant inputs used to estimate the fair value, which involved obtaining significant inputs from independent external sources. For a sample of valuation adjustments, we utilized the assistance of our valuation specialists to evaluate the methodology applied and performed a recalculation of these adjustments. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the fair value measurement of derivatives.\n\n## Valuation of provision for unpaid claims\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the valuation of provisions for unpaid claims in Note/uni00A03 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note/uni00A022 to the consolidated financial statements, TD has recognized $7,468/uni00A0million in insurance-related liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. The insurance-related liabilities include a provision for unpaid claims, which is determined in accordance with accepted actuarial practices.\n\nAuditing the provision for unpaid claims required the application of significant judgement and involved the use of specialists due to the complex nature of the models, methodologies and assumptions applied in the determination of the provision. Claims liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. The main assumption underlying the estimate of the claims liability is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and therefore ultimate claim costs. Actuarial methods are applied to extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, frequency and severity of claims based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Additional qualitative judgement is applied to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims costs that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved.\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the valuation of the provision for unpaid claims including the associated controls over relevant IT systems. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls related to TD's claims and actuarial processes including over the completeness and accuracy of data flow through the claims administration systems, and the overall review of the provision for unpaid claims by management.",

To test the valuation for unpaid claims, our audit procedures included, amongst others, involving our actuarial specialists to independently calculate the provision for unpaid claims on a sample basis. This included assessing the accuracy of TD's data by agreeing to source systems on a sample basis and benchmarking the assumptions against industry trends. With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we assessed TD's actuary's methodologies and significant assumptions, including comparing the rationale for the judgments applied against generally accepted actuarial practices. We also performed data integrity testing of incurred claims, paid claims, and earned premiums used in the estimation of the provision for unpaid claims.\n\n## Measurement of provision for uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter\n\nTD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to income taxes in Note/uni00A03 and Note/uni00A025 of the consolidated financial statements. As a financial institution operating in multiple jurisdictions, TD is subject to complex and constantly evolving tax legislation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. TD uses significant judgment in i) determining whether it is probable that TD will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of certain uncertain tax positions and ii) measuring the amount of the liability.\n\nAuditing TD's provision for uncertain tax positions involved the application of judgment and is based on interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence.\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n## To the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank\n\n## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited The Toronto-Dominion Bank's (TD) internal control over financial reporting as of October/uni00A031, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, TD maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October/uni00A031, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of TD as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes, and our report dated November/uni00A030, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nTD's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting contained in the accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on TD's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to TD in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over TD's provision for uncertain tax positions. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management's process to measure the provision for uncertain tax positions.\n\nWith the assistance of our tax professionals, we assessed the technical merits and the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, using our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate TD's interpretations and assessment of tax laws with respect to uncertain tax positions. We assessed the implications of correspondence received by TD from the relevant tax authorities and evaluated income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants\n\nWe have served as TD's sole auditor since 2006.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants\n\nToronto, Canada November/uni00A030, 2022",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## N O T E 1 | NATURE OF OPERATIONS\n\n## CORPORATE INFORMATION\n\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the /uni00A0Bank Act (Canada) . The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) . The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group ('TD' or the 'Bank'). The/uni00A0Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The/uni00A0Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The/uni00A0Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking.\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the/uni00A0Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions\n\n## N O T E 2 | SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of the/uni00A0Bank and its subsidiaries including certain structured entities which it controls.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are corporations or other legal entities controlled by the/uni00A0Bank, generally through directly holding more than half of the voting power of the entity. Control of subsidiaries is determined based on the power exercisable through ownership of voting rights and is generally aligned with the risks and/or returns (collectively referred to as 'variable returns') absorbed from subsidiaries through those voting rights. As a result, the/uni00A0Bank controls and consolidates subsidiaries when it holds the majority of the voting rights of the subsidiary, unless there is evidence that another investor has control over the subsidiary. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the/uni00A0Bank controls an entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the/uni00A0Bank obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when control ceases to exist.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank may consolidate certain subsidiaries where it owns 50% or less of the voting rights. Most of those subsidiaries are structured entities as described in the following section.\n\n## Structured Entities\n\nStructured entities are entities created to accomplish a narrow and welldefined objective. Structured entities may take the form of a corporation, trust, partnership, or unincorporated entity. They are often created with legal arrangements that impose limits on the decision-making powers of their governing board, trustee, or management. Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the/uni00A0Bank and the structured entity indicates that the/uni00A0Bank controls the entity. When assessing whether the/uni00A0Bank has to consolidate a structured entity, the/uni00A0Bank evaluates three primary criteria in order to conclude whether, in substance:\n\nCanada (OSFI). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared using the accounting policies as described in Note/uni00A02. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note/uni00A03. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur.\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the/uni00A0Bank were approved and authorized for issue by the/uni00A0Bank's Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on November/uni00A030, 2022.\n\nThe risk management policies and procedures of the/uni00A0Bank are provided in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The shaded sections of the 'Managing Risk' section of the 2022 MD&A, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted by IFRS.\n\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Bank has the power to direct the activities of the structured entity that have the most significant impact on the entity's variable returns;\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Bank is exposed to significant variable returns arising from the entity; and\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Bank has the ability to use its power to affect the variable returns to which it is exposed.\n\nConsolidation conclusions are reassessed at the end of each financial reporting period. The/uni00A0Bank's policy is to consider the impact on consolidation of all significant changes in circumstances, focusing on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Substantive changes in ownership, such as the purchase or disposal of more than an insignificant interest in an entity;\n- \u00b7 Changes in contractual or governance arrangements of an entity;\n- \u00b7 Additional activities undertaken, such as providing a liquidity facility beyond the original terms or entering into a transaction not originally contemplated;\n- \u00b7 Changes in the financing structure of an entity; and\n- \u00b7 Changes in the rights to exercise power over an entity.\n\n## Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nEntities over which the/uni00A0Bank has significant influence are associates and entities over which the/uni00A0Bank has joint control are joint ventures. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an investee, but is not control or joint control over these entities. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the/uni00A0Bank holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of an entity. Significant influence may also exist where the/uni00A0Bank holds less than 20% of the voting rights and has influence over financial and operating policy-making processes, through board representation and significant commercial arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet initially at cost and increased or decreased to recognize the/uni00A0Bank's share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture, capital transactions, including the receipt of any dividends, and write-downs to reflect any impairment in the value of such entities. These increases or decreases, together with any gains and losses realized on disposition, are reported on the Consolidated Statement",

        "page_content": "of Income. The carrying amount of the investments also includes the/uni00A0Bank's share of the investee's other comprehensive income or loss, which is reported in the relevant section of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the/uni00A0Bank assesses whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired. The/uni00A0Bank calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the higher of fair value or value-in-use and its carrying value.\n\n## CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS\n\nCash and due from banks consist of cash and amounts due from banks which are issued by investment grade financial institutions. These amounts are due on demand or have an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration the/uni00A0Bank expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The/uni00A0Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a good or a service to a customer at a point in time or over time. The determination of when performance obligations are satisfied requires the use of judgment. Refer to Note/uni00A03 for further details.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank identifies contracts with customers subject to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which create enforceable rights and obligations. The/uni00A0Bank determines the performance obligations based on distinct services promised to the customers in the contracts. The/uni00A0Bank's contracts generally have a term of one year or less, consist of a single performance obligation, and the performance obligations generally reflect services.\n\nFor each contract, the/uni00A0Bank determines the transaction price, which includes estimating variable consideration and assessing whether the price is constrained. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the amount will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As such, the estimate of the variable consideration is constrained until the end of the invoicing period. The uncertainty is generally resolved at the end of the reporting period and as such, no significant judgment is required when recognizing variable consideration in revenues.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's receipt of payment from customers generally occurs subsequent to the satisfaction of performance obligations or a short time thereafter. As such, the/uni00A0Bank has not recognized any material contract assets (unbilled receivables) or contract liabilities (deferred revenues) and there is no significant financing component associated with the consideration due to the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nWhen another party is involved in the transfer of services to a customer, an assessment is made to evaluate whether the/uni00A0Bank is the principal such that revenues are reported on a gross basis or the agent such that revenues are reported on a net basis. The/uni00A0Bank is the principal when it controls the services in the contract promised to the customer before they are transferred. Control is demonstrated by the/uni00A0Bank being primarily responsible for fulfilling the transfer of the services to the customer, having discretion in establishing pricing of the services, or both.\n\n## Investment and securities services\n\nInvestment and securities services income includes asset management fees, administration and commission fees, and investment banking fees. The/uni00A0Bank recognizes asset management and administration fees based on time elapsed, which depicts the rendering of investment management and related services over time. The fees are primarily calculated based on average daily or point in time assets under management (AUM) or assets under administration (AUA) depending on the investment mandate.\n\nCommission fees include sales, trailer and brokerage commissions. Sales and brokerage commissions are generally recognized at a point in time when the transaction is executed. Trailer commissions are recognized over time and are generally calculated based on the average daily net asset value of the fund during the period.\n\nInvestment banking fees include advisory fees and underwriting fees and are generally recognized at a point in time upon successful completion of the engagement.\n\n## Credit fees\n\nCredit fees include liquidity fees, restructuring fees, letter of credit fees, and loan syndication fees. Liquidity, restructuring, and letter of credit fees are recognized in income over the period in which the service is provided. Loan syndication fees are generally recognized at a point in time upon completion of the financing placement.\n\n## Service charges\n\nService charges income is earned on personal and commercial deposit accounts and consists of account fees and transaction-based service charges. Account fees relate to account maintenance activities and are recognized in income over the period in which the service is provided. Transaction-based service charges are recognized as earned at a point in time when the transaction is complete.\n\n## Card services\n\nCard services income includes interchange income as well as card fees such as annual and transactional fees. Interchange income is recognized at a point in time when the transaction is authorized and funded. Card fees are recognized as earned at the transaction date with the exception of annual fees, which are recognized over a twelve-month period.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank adopted Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, Amendments to IFRS/uni00A09, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase/uni00A01), including the applicable amendments to IFRS 7 relating to hedge accounting, in the fourth quarter of 2019. Under these amendments, it is assumed that the hedged interest rate benchmark is not altered and thus hedge accounting continues through to the date of replacement of the existing interest rate benchmark with its alternative reference rate (ARR). The/uni00A0Bank is not required to discontinue hedge accounting if the actual results of the hedge do not meet the effectiveness requirements as a result of interbank offered rate (IBOR) reform. Refer to Note/uni00A011 for disclosures related to the/uni00A0Bank's hedge accounting relationships impacted by IBOR reform.\n\nRefer to Note/uni00A03 for details of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase/uni00A02, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2), issued on August 27, 2020 and early adopted by the/uni00A0Bank on November/uni00A01, 2020.\n\n## Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank classifies its financial assets into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);\n- \u00b7 Held-for-trading;\n- \u00b7 Non-trading fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and\n- \u00b7 Designated as measured at FVTPL.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank recognizes financial assets on a settlement date basis, except for derivatives and securities, which are recognized on a trade date basis.\n\n## Debt Instruments\n\nThe classification and measurement for debt instruments is based on the/uni00A0Bank's business models for managing its financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Refer to Note/uni00A03 for judgment with respect to the determination of the/uni00A0Bank's business models and whether contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank has determined its business models as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Held-to-collect: the objective is to collect contractual cash flows;\n- \u00b7 Held-to-collect-and-sell: the objective is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 Held-for-sale and other business models: the objective is neither of the above.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank performs the SPPI test for financial assets held within the heldto-collect and held-to-collect-and-sell business models. If these financial assets have contractual cash flows which are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement that do not pass the SPPI test, they are classified as non-trading financial assets measured at FVTPL. In a basic lending arrangement, interest includes only consideration for time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks, and a reasonable profit margin.",

        "page_content": "Debt Securities and Loans Measured at Amortized Cost Debt securities and loans held within a held-to-collect business model where their contractual cash flows pass the SPPI test are measured at amortized cost. The carrying amount of these financial assets is adjusted by an allowance for credit losses recognized and measured as described in the Impairment - Expected Credit Loss Model section of this Note, as well as any write-offs and unearned income which includes prepaid interest, loan origination fees and costs, commitment fees, loan syndication fees, and unamortized discounts or premiums. Interest income is recognized using EIRM. The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and costs are considered to be adjustments to the loan yield and are recognized in interest income over the term of the loan. Commitment fees are recognized in credit fees over the commitment period when it is unlikely that the commitment will be called upon; otherwise, they are recognized in interest income over the term of the resulting loan. Loan syndication fees are recognized in credit fees upon completion of the financing placement unless the yield on any loan retained by the/uni00A0Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing syndicate. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fee is recognized as a yield adjustment in interest income over the term of the loan.\n\n## Debt Securities and Loans Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nDebt securities and loans held within a held-to-collect-and-sell business model where their contractual cash flows pass the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI. Fair value changes are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortized cost, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income is recognized using EIRM. The expected credit loss (ECL) allowance is recognized and measured as described in the Impairment/uni00A0-/uni00A0Expected Credit Loss Model section of this Note. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to income and recognized in other income (loss).\n\n## Financial Assets Held-for-Trading\n\nThe held-for-sale business model includes financial assets held within a trading portfolio, which have been originated, acquired, or incurred principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, or if they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit-taking. Financial assets held within this business model consist of trading securities, trading loans, as well as certain securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nTrading portfolio assets are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in trading income (loss). Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Dividends are recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest is recognized on an accrual basis. Both dividends and interest are included in interest income.\n\n## Non-Trading Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss\n\nNon-trading financial assets measured at FVTPL include financial assets held within the held-for-sale and other business models, for example debt securities and loans managed on a fair value basis. Financial assets held within the held-to-collect or held-to-collect-and-sell business models that do not pass the SPPI test are also classified as non-trading financial assets measured at FVTPL. Changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal are recognized in other income (loss). Interest income from debt instruments is included in interest income on an accrual basis.\n\nFinancial Assets Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Debt instruments in a held-to-collect or held-to-collect-and-sell business model can be designated at initial recognition as measured at FVTPL, provided the designation can eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring these financial assets on a different basis. The FVTPL designation is available\n\nonly for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Once financial assets are designated at FVTPL, the designation is irrevocable. Changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal are recognized in other income (loss). Interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income on an accrual basis.\n\n## Customers' Liability under Acceptances\n\nAcceptances represent a form of negotiable short-term debt issued by customers, which the/uni00A0Bank guarantees for a fee. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis. The potential obligation of the/uni00A0Bank is reported as a liability under Acceptances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The/uni00A0Bank's recourse against the customer in the event of a call on any of these commitments is reported as an asset of the same amount.\n\n## Equity Instruments\n\nEquity investments are required to be measured at FVTPL, except where the/uni00A0Bank has elected at initial recognition to irrevocably designate an equity investment, held for purposes other than trading, at FVOCI. If such an election is made, the fair value changes, including any associated foreign exchange gains or losses, are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not subsequently reclassified to net income, including upon disposal. Realized gains and losses are transferred directly to retained earnings upon disposal. Consequently, there is no review required for impairment. Dividends will normally be recognized in interest income unless the dividends represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Gains and losses on trading and non-trading equity investments measured at FVTPL are included in trading income (loss) and other income (loss), respectively.\n\n## Classification and Measurement for Financial Liabilities\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Held-for-trading;\n- \u00b7 Designated at FVTPL; and\n- \u00b7 Other liabilities.\n\n## Financial Liabilities Held-for-Trading\n\nFinancial liabilities are held within a trading portfolio if they have been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Financial liabilities held-for-trading are primarily trading deposits, securitization liabilities at fair value, obligations related to securities sold short and certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements.\n\nTrading portfolio liabilities are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal recognized in trading income (loss). Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis in interest expense.\n\n## Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss\n\nCertain financial liabilities may be designated at FVTPL at initial recognition. To be designated at FVTPL, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; (2) the financial liabilities or a group of financial assets and financial liabilities are managed, and its performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (3) the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or b) it is clear with little or no analysis that separation of the embedded derivative from the financial instrument is prohibited. In addition, the FVTPL designation is available only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Once financial liabilities are designated at FVTPL, the designation is irrevocable.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at FVTPL are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal recognized in other income (loss), except for the amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in the/uni00A0Bank's own credit risk, which is presented in other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are not subsequently",

        "page_content": "reclassified to net income upon derecognition of the financial liability; instead, they are transferred directly to retained earnings.\n\nChanges in fair value attributable to changes in the/uni00A0Bank's own credit risk are measured as the difference between: (i) the period-over-period change in the present value of the expected cash flows using an all-in discount curve reflecting both the interest rate benchmark curve and the/uni00A0Bank's own credit curve; and (ii) the period-over-period change in the present value of the same expected cash flows using a discount curve based solely on the interest rate benchmark curve.\n\nFor loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are designated at FVTPL, the full change in fair value of the liability is recognized in other income (loss).\n\nInterest is recognized on an accrual basis in interest expense.\n\n## Other Financial Liabilities\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits, other than deposits included in a trading portfolio and deposits designated at FVTPL, are accounted for at amortized cost. Accrued interest on deposits is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest, including capitalized transaction costs, is recognized on an accrual basis using EIRM as Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Subordinated Notes and Debentures\n\nSubordinated notes and debentures are accounted for at amortized cost. Accrued interest on subordinated notes and debentures is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest, including capitalized transaction costs, is recognized on an accrual basis using EIRM as Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Reclassification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except for financial assets for which the/uni00A0Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. Such reclassifications of financial assets are expected to be rare in practice.\n\n## Impairment - Expected Credit Loss Model\n\nThe ECL model applies to financial assets, including loans and debt securities measured at amortized cost, loans and debt securities measured at FVOCI, loan commitments, and financial guarantees that are not measured at FVTPL.\n\nThe ECL model consists of three stages: Stage 1 - Twelve-month ECLs for performing financial assets, Stage 2 - Lifetime ECLs for financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, and Stage 3 - Lifetime ECLs for financial assets that are credit-impaired. ECLs are the difference between all the contractual cash flows that are due to the/uni00A0Bank in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the/uni00A0Bank expects to receive, discounted at the original EIR. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition, impairment is measured as lifetime ECLs. Otherwise, impairment is measured as twelve-month ECLs which represent the portion of lifetime ECLs that are expected to occur based on default events that are possible within twelve months after the reporting date. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer considered significant, the loss allowance reverts to being measured based on twelve-month ECLs.\n\n## Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nFor retail exposures, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on changes in the twelve-month probability of default (PD) since initial recognition, using a combination of individual and collective information that incorporates borrower and account specific attributes and relevant forward-looking macroeconomic variables.\n\nFor non-retail exposures, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on changes in the internal risk rating (borrower risk ratings (BRR)) since initial recognition. Refer to the shaded areas of the 'Managing Risk' section of the 2022 MD&A for further details on the/uni00A0Bank's 21-point BRR scale to risk levels.\n\nFor both retail and non-retail exposures, delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due is also used in assessing significant increase in credit risk.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank defines default as delinquency of 90 days or more for most retail products and BRR of 9 for non-retail exposures. Exposures are\n\nconsidered credit-impaired and migrate to Stage 3 when the definition of default is met or when there is objective evidence that there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent the/uni00A0Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest.\n\nWhen assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition of a financial asset, the/uni00A0Bank considers all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort about past events, current conditions, and forecast of future economic conditions. Refer to Note/uni00A03 for additional details.\n\n## Measurement of Expected Credit Losses\n\nECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and consider reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the/uni00A0Bank's credit risk assessment. Expected life is the maximum contractual period the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to credit risk, including extension options for which the borrower has unilateral right to exercise. For certain financial instruments that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment, and the/uni00A0Bank's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, ECLs are measured over the period the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to credit risk. For example, ECLs for credit cards are measured over the borrowers' expected behavioural life, incorporating survivorship assumptions and borrower-specific attributes.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank leverages its Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB) models used for regulatory capital purposes and incorporates adjustments where appropriate to calculate ECLs.\n\n## Forward-Looking Information and Expert Credit Judgment\n\nForward-looking information is considered when determining significant increase in credit risk and measuring ECLs. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors are incorporated in the risk parameters as relevant.\n\nQualitative factors that are not already considered in the quantitative models are incorporated by applying expert credit judgment in determining the final ECLs. Refer to Note/uni00A03 for additional details.\n\n## Modified Loans\n\nIn cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties, the/uni00A0Bank may grant certain modifications to the terms and conditions of a loan. Modifications may include payment deferrals, extension of amortization periods, rate reductions, principal forgiveness, debt consolidation, forbearance and other modifications intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. The/uni00A0Bank has policies in place to determine the appropriate remediation strategy based on the individual borrower.\n\nIf the/uni00A0Bank determines that a modification results in expiry of cash flows, the original asset is derecognized and a new asset is recognized based on the new contractual terms. Significant increase in credit risk is assessed relative to the risk of default on the date of modification.\n\nIf the/uni00A0Bank determines that a modification does not result in derecognition, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on the risk of default at initial recognition of the original asset. Expected cash flows arising from the modified contractual terms are considered when calculating ECLs for the modified asset. For loans that were modified while having lifetime ECLs, the loans can revert to having twelve-month ECLs after a period of performance and improvement in the borrower's financial condition.\n\n## Allowance for Loan Losses, Excluding Acquired Credit-Impaired Loans\n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's calculation of probability-weighted ECLs in the lending portfolios, including any offbalance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses for lending portfolios reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which includes credit-related allowances for residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal, credit card, business and government loans, and customers' liability under acceptances, is deducted from Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The allowance for loan losses for loans measured at FVOCI is presented on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The allowance for loan losses for offbalance sheet instruments, which relates to certain guarantees, letters",

        "page_content": "of credit, and undrawn lines of credit, is recognized in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Allowances for lending portfolios reported on the balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures are calculated using the same methodology. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses and decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals. Each quarter, allowances are reassessed and adjusted based on any changes in management's estimate of ECLs. Loan losses on impaired loans in Stage 3 continue to be recognized by means of an allowance for loan losses until a loan is written off.\n\nA loan is written off against the related allowance for loan losses when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Non-retail loans are generally written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted, such as when a loan is sold, when all security has been realized, or when all security has been resolved with the receiver or bankruptcy court. Non-real estate retail loans are generally written off when contractual payments are 180 days past due, or when a loan is sold. Real-estate secured retail loans are generally written off when the security is realized. The time period over which the/uni00A0Bank performs collection activities on the contractual amount outstanding of financial assets that are written off varies from one jurisdiction to another and generally spans between less than one year to five years.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on debt securities represents management's calculation of probability-weighted ECLs. Debt securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The allowance for credit losses on debt securities measured at FVOCI are presented on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses and decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals.\n\n## Acquired Performing Loans\n\nAcquired performing loans are initially measured at fair value, which considers incurred and expected future credit losses estimated at the acquisition date and also reflects adjustments based on the acquired loan's interest rate in comparison to current market rates. On acquisition, twelve-month ECLs are recognized on the acquired performing loans, resulting in the carrying amount being lower than fair value. Acquired performing loans are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on their contractual cash flows and any acquisition related discount or premium, including credit-related discounts, is considered to be an adjustment to the loan yield and is recognized in interest income using EIRM over the term of the loan, or the expected life of the loan for acquired performing loans with revolving terms.\n\n## Acquired Credit-Impaired Loans\n\nWhen loans are acquired with evidence of incurred credit loss where it is probable at the purchase date that the/uni00A0Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, they are generally considered to be acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans, with no ECLs recognized on acquisition. ACI loans are identified as impaired at acquisition based on specific risk characteristics of the loans, including past due status, performance history, and recent borrower credit scores. ACI loans are accounted for based on the present value of expected cash flows as opposed to their contractual cash flows. The/uni00A0Bank determines the fair value of these loans at the acquisition date by discounting expected cash flows at a discount rate that reflects factors a market participant would use when determining fair value, including management assumptions relating to default rates, loss severities, the amount and timing of prepayments, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. With respect to certain individually significant ACI loans, accounting is applied individually at the loan level. The remaining ACI loans are aggregated provided they are acquired in the same fiscal quarter and have common risk characteristics. Aggregated loans are accounted for as a single asset with aggregated cash flows and a single composite interest rate. Subsequent to acquisition, the/uni00A0Bank regularly reassesses and updates its cash flow estimates for changes to assumptions relating to default rates, loss severities, the amount and timing of prepayments, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows trigger the recognition of additional impairment, which is measured based on the\n\npresent value of the revised expected cash flows discounted at the loan's EIR as compared to the carrying value of the loan. The ECL in excess of the initial credit-related discount is recorded through the provision for credit losses. Interest income on ACI loans is calculated by applying the creditadjusted EIR to the amortized cost of ACI loans.\n\n## SHARE CAPITAL AND OTHER EQUITY INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank classifies financial instruments that it issues as either financial liabilities, equity instruments, or compound instruments.\n\nIssued instruments that are mandatorily redeemable or convertible into a variable number of the/uni00A0Bank's common shares at the holder's option are classified as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Dividend or interest payments on these instruments are recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nIssued instruments are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets to redeem or convert these instruments. Such instruments, if not mandatorily redeemable or convertible into a variable number of the/uni00A0Bank's common shares at the holder's option, are classified as equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are included in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. Dividends and distributions on these instruments are recognized as a reduction in equity.\n\nCompound instruments are comprised of both liability and equity components in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. The liability component is initially measured at fair value with any residual amount assigned to the equity component. Issuance costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.\n\nCommon shares, preferred shares, and other equity instruments issued and held by the/uni00A0Bank are classified as treasury instruments in equity, and the cost of these instruments is recorded as a reduction in equity. Upon the sale of treasury instruments, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost of the instruments is recorded in or against contributed surplus.\n\n## GUARANTEES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank issues guarantee contracts that require payments to be made to guaranteed parties based on: (1) changes in the underlying economic characteristics relating to an asset or liability of the guaranteed party; (2) failure of another party to perform under an obligating agreement; or (3) failure of another third party to pay its indebtedness when due. Guarantees are initially measured and recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a guarantee liability at initial recognition is normally equal to the present value of the guarantee fees received over the life of the contract. The/uni00A0Bank's release from risk is recognized over the term of the guarantee using a systematic and rational amortization method.\n\nIf a guarantee meets the definition of a derivative, it is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reported as a derivative asset or derivative liability at fair value. Guarantees that are considered derivatives are over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivative contracts designed to transfer the credit risk in an underlying financial instrument from one counterparty to another.\n\n## DERIVATIVES\n\nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from changes in underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodity prices, equities, or other financial or non-financial measures. Such instruments include interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and credit derivative contracts. The/uni00A0Bank uses these instruments for trading and non-trading purposes. Derivatives are carried at their fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Derivatives Held for Trading Purposes\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank enters into trading derivative contracts to meet the needs of its customers, to provide liquidity and market-making related activities, and in certain cases, to manage risks related to its trading portfolios. The realized and unrealized gains or losses on trading derivatives are recognized in trading income (loss).\n\n## Derivatives Held for Non-trading Purposes\n\nNon-trading derivatives are primarily used to manage interest rate, foreign exchange, and other market risks of the/uni00A0Bank's traditional banking activities. When derivatives are held for non-trading purposes and when the transactions meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS/uni00A039,",

        "page_content": "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS/uni00A039), they are presented as non-trading derivatives and receive hedge accounting treatment, as appropriate. Certain derivative instruments that are held for economic hedging purposes, and do not meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39, are also presented as non-trading derivatives with the change in fair value of these derivatives recognized in noninterest income.\n\n## Hedging Relationships\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank has an accounting policy choice to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) or IAS/uni00A039. The/uni00A0Bank has made the decision to continue applying the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements and complies with the revised annual hedge accounting disclosures as required by the related amendments to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7).\n\nAt the inception of a hedging relationship, the/uni00A0Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objective, and its strategy for undertaking the hedge. The/uni00A0Bank also requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether or not the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to the hedged risks in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. In order to be considered highly effective, the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly and inversely correlated such that the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will substantially offset the effects of the hedged exposure throughout the term of the hedging relationship. If a hedging relationship becomes ineffective, it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and any subsequent change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nChanges in fair value relating to the derivative component excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nWhen derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships, the/uni00A0Bank classifies them either as: (1) hedges of the changes in fair value of recognized assets, liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); (2) hedges of the variability in highly probable future cash flows attributable to recognized assets, liabilities or forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges).\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nA hedging relationship is affected by IBOR reform if the reform gives rise to uncertainties about (a) the interest rate benchmark (contractually or non-contractually specified) designated as a hedged risk; and/or (b) the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument.\n\nFor such hedging relationships, the following temporary exceptions apply during the period of uncertainty:\n\n- \u00b7 When assessing whether a forecast transaction is highly probable or expected to occur, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform;\n- \u00b7 When assessing whether a hedge is expected to be highly effective, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of IBOR reform;\n- \u00b7 A hedge is not required to be discontinued if the actual results of the hedge are outside of a range of 80-125 per cent as a result of IBOR reform; and\n- \u00b7 For a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, the requirement that the risk component is separately identifiable need only be met at the inception of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.\n\nThe change in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, as well as the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in net interest income to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective. Any change in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is recognized immediately in non-interest income.\n\nThe cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item (the basis adjustment) is amortized to Net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income based on a recalculated EIR over the remaining expected life of the hedged item, with amortization beginning no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Where the hedged item has been derecognized, the basis adjustment is immediately released to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is exposed to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and equity price risks. The amounts and timing of future cash flows are projected for each hedged exposure on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults.\n\nThe effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of the derivative relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in non-interest income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are reclassified to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period during which the hedged item affects income.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in AOCI at that time remains in AOCI until the forecast transaction impacts the Consolidated Statement of Income. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in AOCI is immediately reclassified to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similar to cash flow hedges. The change in fair value on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion is recognized in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in non-interest income. Gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income upon the disposal or partial disposal of the investment in the foreign operation. The/uni00A0Bank designates derivatives and non-derivatives (such as foreign currency deposit liabilities) as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives\n\nDerivatives may be embedded in financial liabilities or other host contracts. Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host instrument, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income, such as held-for-trading or designated at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from the host contract, are recognized as Derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

        "page_content": "## TRANSLATION AND PRESENTATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars. Items included in the financial statements of each of the/uni00A0Bank's entities are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that differs from an entity's functional currency are translated into the functional currency of the entity at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated into an entity's functional currency at average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are included in non-interest income except for equity investments designated at FVOCI where unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nForeign operations are those with a functional currency other than Canadian dollars. For the purpose of translation into the/uni00A0Bank's presentation currency, all assets and liabilities are first measured in the functional currency of the foreign operation and subsequently, translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations, net of gains or losses arising from net investment hedges and applicable income taxes, are included in other comprehensive income. Translation gains and losses in AOCI are recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income upon the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. The investment balance of foreign entities accounted for by the equity method, including the/uni00A0Bank's investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation, is translated into Canadian dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with exchange gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, only if the/uni00A0Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In all other situations, assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis.\n\n## DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, as evidenced by the fair value of the consideration given or received. The best evidence of fair value is quoted prices in active markets. When there is no active market for the instrument, the fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions involving the same or similar instruments, without modification or repackaging, or based on a valuation technique which maximizes the use of observable market inputs.\n\nWhen financial assets and liabilities have offsetting market risks or credit risks, the/uni00A0Bank applies a measurement exception, as described in Note/uni00A05 under Portfolio Exception. The value determined from application of the portfolio exception must be allocated to the individual financial instruments within the group to arrive at the fair value of an individual financial instrument. Balance sheet offsetting presentation requirements, as described above under the Offsetting of Financial Instruments section of this Note, are then applied, if applicable.\n\nValuation adjustments reflect the/uni00A0Bank's assessment of factors that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The/uni00A0Bank recognizes various types of valuation adjustments including, but not limited to, adjustments for bid-offer spreads, adjustments for the unobservability of inputs used in pricing models, and adjustments for assumptions about risk, such as the creditworthiness of either counterparty and market implied unsecured funding costs and benefits for OTC derivatives.\n\nIf there is a difference between the initial transaction price and the value based on a valuation technique, the difference is referred to as inception profit or loss. Inception profit or loss is recognized upon initial recognition of the instrument only if the fair value is based on observable inputs. When an instrument is measured using a valuation technique\n\nthat utilizes significant non-observable inputs, it is initially valued at the transaction price, which is considered the best estimate of fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, any difference between the transaction price and the value determined by the valuation technique at initial recognition is recognized as non-observable inputs become observable.\n\nIf the fair value of a financial asset measured at fair value becomes negative, it is recognized as a financial liability until either its fair value becomes positive, at which time it is recognized as a financial asset, or until it is extinguished.\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to that asset have expired. Derecognition may also be appropriate where the contractual right to receive future cash flows from the asset have been transferred, or where the/uni00A0Bank retains the rights to future cash flows from the asset, but assumes an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain criteria.\n\nWhen the/uni00A0Bank transfers a financial asset, it is necessary to assess the extent to which the/uni00A0Bank has retained the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been retained, the/uni00A0Bank continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a financial liability for the consideration received. Certain transaction costs incurred are also capitalized and amortized using EIRM. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred, the/uni00A0Bank will derecognize the financial asset and recognize separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. The/uni00A0Bank determines whether substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred by quantitatively comparing the variability in cash flows before and after the transfer. If the variability in cash flows does not change significantly as a result of the transfer, the/uni00A0Bank has retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nIf the/uni00A0Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the/uni00A0Bank derecognizes the financial asset where it has relinquished control of the financial asset. The/uni00A0Bank is considered to have relinquished control of the financial asset where the transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred financial asset. Where the/uni00A0Bank has retained control of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset. Under these circumstances, the/uni00A0Bank usually retains the rights to future cash flows relating to the asset through a residual interest and is exposed to some degree of risk associated with the financial asset.\n\nThe derecognition criteria are also applied to the transfer of part of an asset, rather than the asset as a whole, or to a group of similar financial assets in their entirety, when applicable. If transferring a part of an asset, it must be a specifically identified cash flow, a fully proportionate share of the asset, or a fully proportionate share of a specifically identified cash flow.\n\n## Securitization\n\nSecuritization is the process by which financial assets are transformed into securities. The/uni00A0Bank securitizes financial assets by transferring those financial assets to a third party and as part of the securitization, certain financial assets may be retained and may consist of an interest-only strip and, in some cases, a cash reserve account (collectively referred to as 'retained interests'). If the transfer qualifies for derecognition, a gain or loss on sale of the financial assets is recognized immediately in other income (loss) after considering the effect of hedge accounting on the assets sold, if applicable. The amount of the gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, the fair value of any financial asset received or financial liability assumed, and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. To determine the value of the retained interest initially recorded, the previous carrying value of the transferred asset is allocated between the amount derecognized from the balance sheet and the retained interest recorded, in proportion to their relative fair values on the date of transfer.

        "page_content": "to initial recognition, as market prices are generally not available for retained interests, fair value is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows using management's best estimates of key assumptions that market participants would use in determining such fair value. Refer to Note/uni00A03 for assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of retained interests. Retained interest is classified as trading securities with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in trading income (loss).\n\nWhere the/uni00A0Bank retains the servicing rights, the benefits of servicing are assessed against market expectations. When the benefits of servicing are more than adequate, a servicing asset is recognized. Similarly, when the benefits of servicing are less than adequate, a servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank derecognizes a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability from the same lender on substantially different terms or where the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, the original liability is derecognized and a new liability is recognized with the difference in the respective carrying amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements, and Securities Borrowing and Lending\n\nSecurities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements involve the purchase of securities by the/uni00A0Bank under agreements to resell the securities at a future date. These agreements are treated as collateralized lending transactions whereby the/uni00A0Bank takes possession of the purchased securities, but does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. The/uni00A0Bank monitors the market value of the purchased securities relative to the amounts due under the reverse repurchase agreements, and when necessary, requires transfer of additional collateral. In the event of counterparty default, the agreements provide the/uni00A0Bank with the right to liquidate the collateral held and offset the proceeds against the amount owing from the counterparty.\n\nObligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities by the/uni00A0Bank to counterparties under agreements to repurchase the securities at a future date. These agreements do not result in the risks and rewards of ownership being relinquished and are treated as collateralized borrowing transactions. The/uni00A0Bank monitors the market value of the securities sold relative to the amounts due under the repurchase agreements, and when necessary, transfers additional collateral or may require counterparties to return the collateral pledged. Certain transactions that do not meet derecognition criteria are also included in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements. Refer to Note/uni00A09 for further details.\n\nSecurities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements are initially recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the respective prices at which the securities were originally acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. Subsequently, the agreements are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus accrued interest, except when they are held-for-trading or are designated at FVTPL. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is determined using EIRM and is included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in fair value on reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements that are held-for-trading or are designated at FVTPL are included in Trading income (loss) or in Other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nIn securities lending transactions, the/uni00A0Bank lends securities to a counterparty and receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. If cash collateral is received, the/uni00A0Bank records the cash along with an obligation to return the cash as Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are received as collateral, the/uni00A0Bank does not record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn securities borrowing transactions, the/uni00A0Bank borrows securities from a counterparty and pledges either cash or securities as collateral. If cash is pledged as collateral, the/uni00A0Bank records the transaction as Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If securities are pledged as collateral, the securities remain on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhere securities are pledged or received as collateral, security borrowing fees and security lending income are recorded in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income over the term of the transaction. Where cash is pledged or received as collateral, interest received or incurred is included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nPhysical commodities purchased or sold with an agreement to sell or repurchase the physical commodities at a later date at a fixed price, are also included in securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, respectively, if the derecognition criteria are not met. These instruments are measured at fair value.\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is carried at its initial cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, regardless of whether any assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the CGU or group of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Each CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill is allocated, represents the lowest level within the/uni00A0Bank at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than an operating segment. If the composition of a CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated changes as a result of the sale of a business, restructuring or other changes, the goodwill is reallocated to the units affected using a relative value approach, unless the/uni00A0Bank can demonstrate that some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the units affected.\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs, which is the higher of its estimated fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use, is determined. If the carrying amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is higher than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss exists. The impairment loss is recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income and cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets represent identifiable non-monetary assets and are acquired either separately or through a business combination, or internally generated software. The/uni00A0Bank's intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles, credit card related intangibles, and software intangibles. Intangible assets are initially recognized at fair value and are amortized over their estimated useful lives (7 to 20 years) proportionate to their expected economic benefits, except for software which is amortized over its estimated useful life (3 to 7 years) on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank assesses its intangible assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis. When impairment indicators are present, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of its estimated fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use, is determined. If the carrying amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the/uni00A0Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the CGU is not impaired, the useful life of the intangible asset is assessed with any changes applied on a prospective basis. An impairment loss is recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses recognized previously are assessed and reversed if the circumstances leading to the impairment are",

Reversal of any impairment loss will not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior periods.\n\n## LAND, BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER DEPRECIABLE ASSETS\n\nLand is recognized at cost. Buildings, computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, other equipment, and leasehold improvements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if any. Gains or losses on disposal are included in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank records the obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated, and records a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the asset. The asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life while the liability is accreted to reflect the passage of time until the eventual settlement of the obligation.\n\nDepreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets estimated by asset category, as follows:\n\n| Asset                  | Useful Life                                                                    |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Buildings              | 15 to 40 years                                                                 |\n| Computer equipment     | 2 to 8 years                                                                   |\n| Furniture and fixtures | 3 to 15 years                                                                  |\n| Other equipment        | 5 to 15 years                                                                  |\n| Leasehold improvements | Lesser of the remaining lease term and the  remaining useful life of the asset |\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank assesses its depreciable assets for changes in useful life or impairment on a quarterly basis. Where an impairment indicator exists and the depreciable asset does not generate separate cash flows on a stand-alone basis, impairment is assessed based on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the depreciable asset belongs. If the CGU is not impaired, the useful life of the depreciable asset is assessed with any changes applied on a prospective basis. Any impairment loss is recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses previously recognized are assessed and reversed if the circumstances leading to their impairment are no longer present. Reversal of any impairment loss will not exceed the carrying amount of the depreciable asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior periods.\n\n## NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE\n\nIndividual non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as heldfor-sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups, and their sale must be highly probable to occur within one year. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and initiate an active program to market the sale of the non-current assets or disposal groups. Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Write-downs on premises related non-current assets and write-downs on equipment on initial classification as held-for-sale are included in the line items Occupancy, including depreciation and Equipment, including depreciation, respectively; both of which are included in Non-interest expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequently, a non-current asset or disposal group that is held-for-sale is no longer depreciated or amortized, and any subsequent write-downs in fair value less costs to sell or such increases not in excess of cumulative write-downs, are recognized in Other income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank grants share options to certain employees as compensation for services provided to the/uni00A0Bank. The/uni00A0Bank uses a binomial tree-based valuation option pricing model to estimate fair value for all share option compensation awards. The cost of the share options is based on the fair value estimated at the grant date and is recognized as compensation expense and contributed surplus over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the awards. This period is generally\n\nequal to the vesting period in addition to a period prior to the grant date. For the/uni00A0Bank's share options, this period is generally equal to five years. When options are exercised, the amount initially recognized in the contributed surplus balance is reduced, with a corresponding increase in common shares.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank has various other share-based compensation plans where certain employees are awarded share units equivalent to the/uni00A0Bank's common shares as compensation for services provided to the/uni00A0Bank. The obligation related to share units is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the share units at the grant date adjusted for changes in fair value between the grant date and the vesting date, net of hedging activities, over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the awards. This period is generally equal to the vesting period, in addition to a period prior to the grant date. For the/uni00A0Bank's share units, this period is generally equal to four years.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Defined Benefit Plans\n\nActuarial valuations are prepared at least every three years to determine the present value of the projected benefit obligation related to the/uni00A0Bank's defined benefit plans. In periods between actuarial valuations, an extrapolation is performed based on the most recent valuation completed. All remeasurement gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income, with cumulative gains and losses reclassified to retained earnings. Pension and post-retirement defined benefit plan expenses are determined based upon separate actuarial valuations using the projected benefit method pro-rated on service and management's best estimates of discount rate, compensation increases, health care cost trend rate, and mortality rates, which are reviewed annually with the/uni00A0Bank's actuaries. The discount rate used to value liabilities is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans' specific cash flows. The expense recognized includes the cost of benefits for employee service provided in the current year, net interest expense or income on the net defined benefit liability or asset, past service costs related to plan amendments, curtailments or settlements, and administrative costs. Plan amendment costs are recognized in the period of a plan amendment, irrespective of its vested status. Curtailments and settlements are recognized by the/uni00A0Bank when the curtailment or settlement occurs. A curtailment occurs when there is a significant reduction in the number of employees covered by the plan. A settlement occurs when the/uni00A0Bank enters into a transaction that eliminates all further legal or constructive obligation for part or all of the benefits provided under a defined benefit plan.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets and the present value of the projected benefit obligation are measured as at October/uni00A031. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the difference between the cumulative remeasurement gains and losses, expenses, and recognized contributions and is reported in other assets or other liabilities.\n\nNet defined benefit assets recognized by the/uni00A0Bank are subject to a ceiling which limits the asset recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to the amount that is recoverable through refunds of contributions or future contribution holidays. In addition, where a regulatory funding deficit exists related to a defined benefit plan, the/uni00A0Bank is required to record a liability equal to the present value of all future cash payments required to eliminate that deficit.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, annual pension expense is equal to the/uni00A0Bank's contributions to those plans.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\nPremiums for short-duration insurance contracts are deferred as unearned premiums and reported in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the underlying policies, usually twelve months. Such premiums are recognized net of amounts ceded for reinsurance and apply primarily to property and casualty contracts. Unearned premiums are reported in insurance-related liabilities, gross of premiums ceded to reinsurers which are recognized in other assets. Premiums from life and health insurance policies are recognized as income when earned in insurance revenue.",

        "page_content": "For property and casualty insurance, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims and estimates for future claims related to insurable events occurring at or before the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. These are determined by the appointed actuary in accordance with accepted actuarial practices and are reported as other liabilities. Expected claims and policy benefit liabilities are determined on a case-by-case basis and consider such variables as past loss experience, current claims trends and changes in the prevailing social, economic, and legal environment. These liabilities are continually reviewed, and as experience develops and new information becomes known, the liabilities are adjusted as necessary. In addition to reported claims information, the liabilities recognized by the/uni00A0Bank include a provision to account for the future development of insurance claims, including insurance claims incurred but not reported by policyholders (IBNR). IBNR liabilities are evaluated based on historical development trends and actuarial methodologies for groups of claims with similar attributes. For life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities represent the present values of future policy cash flows as determined using standard actuarial valuation practices. Actuarial liabilities are reported in insurance-related liabilities with changes reported in insurance claims and related expenses.\n\n## PROVISIONS\n\nProvisions are recognized when the/uni00A0Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, the amount of which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.\n\nProvisions are measured based on management's best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome tax is comprised of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Provision for (recovery of) income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates that are expected to apply when the assets or liabilities are\n\nreported for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, and associates, and interests in joint ventures if the/uni00A0Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank records a provision for uncertain tax positions if it is probable that the/uni00A0Bank will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of a tax position. This provision is measured at the/uni00A0Bank's best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Provisions are reversed in provision for (recovery of) income taxes in the period in which management determines they are no longer required or as determined by statute.\n\n## LEASES\n\nAn arrangement contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the/uni00A0Bank has a right to control that asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability is recognized for all leases except for short-term leases and low value leases, as described below. At the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the remaining lease term and is discounted using the/uni00A0Bank's incremental borrowing rate. The ROU asset is recognized at cost, comprising an amount equal to the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments. Subsequently, the ROU asset is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities, while the lease liability is accreted using the/uni00A0Bank's incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or changes in the/uni00A0Bank's assumptions or strategies relating to the exercise of purchase, extension, or termination options.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's leases consist primarily of real estate, equipment and other asset leases. ROU assets are recorded in Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Other depreciable assets, and lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest expense on lease liabilities is included in Net interest income and depreciation expense on the ROU assets is recognized in Non-interest expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nShort-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and leases of low-value assets are exempt, and their payments are recognized in Non-interest expenses on a straight-line basis within the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## N O T E 3 | SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe estimates used in the/uni00A0Bank's accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the/uni00A0Bank's policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements. The/uni00A0Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner.\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\n## Business Model Assessment\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank determines its business models based on the objective under which its portfolios of financial assets are managed. Refer to Note/uni00A02 for details on the/uni00A0Bank's business models. In determining its business models, the/uni00A0Bank considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management's intent and strategic objectives and the operation of the stated policies in practice;\n- \u00b7 The primary risks that affect the performance of the portfolio of assets and how these risks are managed;\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to management; and\n- \u00b7 The frequency and significance of financial asset sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and the expected future sales activities.\n\nSales in themselves do not determine the business model and are not considered in isolation. Instead, sales provide evidence about how cash flows are realized. A held-to-collect business model will be reassessed by the/uni00A0Bank to determine whether any sales are consistent with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows if the sales are more than insignificant in value or more than infrequent.\n\n## Solely Payments of Principal and Interest Test\n\nIn assessing whether contractual cash flows represent SPPI, the/uni00A0Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing",

        "page_content": "whether the financial asset contains contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that they would not be consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In making the assessment, the/uni00A0Bank considers the primary terms as follows and assesses if the contractual cash flows of the instrument continue to meet the SPPI test:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance-linked features;\n- \u00b7 Terms that limit the/uni00A0Bank's claim to cash flows from specified assets (non-recourse terms);\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms;\n- \u00b7 Leverage features; and\n- \u00b7 Features that modify elements of the time value of money.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nFor retail exposures, criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate product or portfolio level and vary based on the exposure's credit risk at origination. The criteria include relative changes in PD, absolute PD backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met.\n\nFor non-retail exposures, BRR is determined on an individual borrower basis using industry and sector specific credit risk models that are based on historical data. Current and forward-looking information that is specific to the borrower, industry, and sector is considered based on expert credit judgment. Criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate segmentation level and vary based on the BRR of the exposure at origination. Criteria include relative changes in BRR, absolute BRR backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met.\n\n## Measurement of Expected Credit Loss\n\nECLs are recognized on the initial recognition of financial assets. Allowance for credit losses represents management's unbiased estimate of the risk of default and ECLs on the financial assets, including any offbalance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date.\n\nFor retail exposures, ECLs are calculated as the product of PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) at each time step over the remaining expected life of the financial asset and discounted to the reporting date based on the EIR. PD estimates represent the forwardlooking PD, updated quarterly based on the/uni00A0Bank's historical experience, current conditions, and relevant forward-looking expectations over the expected life of the exposure to determine the lifetime PD curve. LGD estimates are determined based on historical charge-off events and recovery payments, current information about attributes specific to the borrower, and direct costs. Expected cash flows from collateral, guarantees, and other credit enhancements are incorporated in LGD if integral to the contractual terms. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected LGD. EAD represents the expected balance at default across the remaining expected life of the exposure. EAD incorporates forward-looking expectations about repayments of drawn balances and future draws where applicable.\n\nFor non-retail exposures, ECLs are calculated based on the present value of cash shortfalls determined as the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. Lifetime PD is determined by mapping the exposure's BRR to forward-looking PD over the expected life. LGD estimates are determined by mapping the exposure's facility risk rating (FRR) to expected LGD which takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, and loan structure. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected PD and LGD. Expected cash flows are determined by applying the expected LGD to the contractual cash flows to calculate cash shortfalls over the expected life of the exposure.\n\n## Forward-Looking Information\n\nIn calculating ECLs, the/uni00A0Bank employs internally developed models that utilize parameters for PD, LGD, and EAD. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors including at the regional level are incorporated in the risk parameters as relevant. Additional risk factors that are industry or\n\nsegment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are generated by TD Economics as part of the ECL process: A base economic forecast is accompanied with upside and downside estimates of realistically possible economic conditions by considering the sources of uncertainty around the base forecast. All macroeconomic forecasts are updated quarterly for each variable on a regional basis where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the quarterly modelling of base, upside and downside risk parameters used in the calculation of ECL scenarios and probability-weighted ECLs. TD/uni00A0Economics will apply judgment to recommend probability weights to each forecast on a quarterly basis. The proposed macroeconomic forecasts and probability weightings are subject to robust management review and challenge process by a cross-functional committee that includes representation from TD Economics, Risk, Finance, and Business. ECLs calculated under each of the three forecasts are applied against the respective probability weightings to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Refer to Note/uni00A08 for further details on the macroeconomic variables and ECL sensitivity.\n\n## Expert Credit Judgment\n\nManagement's expert credit judgment is used to determine the best estimate for the qualitative component contributing to ECLs, based on an assessment of business and economic conditions, historical loss experience, loan portfolio composition, and other relevant indicators and forward-looking information that are not fully incorporated into the model calculation.\n\nThere remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied.\n\n## LEASES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank applies judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. All facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not to exercise a termination option including investments in major leaseholds, branch performance and past business practice are considered. The periods covered by renewal or termination options are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the/uni00A0Bank will exercise the options; management considers 'reasonably certain' to be a high threshold. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the industry may impact the/uni00A0Bank's assessment of lease term, and any changes in the/uni00A0Bank's estimate of lease terms may have a material impact on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nIn determining the carrying amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities, the/uni00A0Bank is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The/uni00A0Bank determines the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets by incorporating the/uni00A0Bank's creditworthiness, the security, term, and value of the ROU asset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental borrowing rates are subject to change mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is based on their quoted market prices. For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions involving the same or similar instruments, without modification or repackaging, or is based on a valuation technique which maximizes the use of observable market inputs. Observable market inputs may include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and option volatilities. Valuation techniques include comparisons with similar instruments where observable market prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.\n\nFor certain complex or illiquid financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques in which current market",

        "page_content": "transactions or observable market inputs are not available. Judgment is used when determining which valuation techniques to apply, liquidity considerations, and model inputs such as volatilities, correlations, spreads, discount rates, pre-payment rates, and prices of underlying instruments. Any imprecision in these estimates can affect the resulting fair value.\n\nJudgment is also used in recording valuation adjustments to model fair values to account for system limitations or measurement uncertainty, such as when valuing complex and less actively traded financial instruments. If the market for a complex financial instrument develops, the pricing for this instrument may become more transparent, resulting in refinement of valuation models. For example, IBOR reform may also have an impact on the fair value of products that reference or use valuation models with IBOR inputs.\n\nAn analysis of the fair value of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note/uni00A05.\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nCertain financial assets transferred may qualify for derecognition from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. To qualify for derecognition, certain key determinations must be made, including whether the/uni00A0Bank's rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have been retained or transferred and the extent to which the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets have been retained or transferred. If the/uni00A0Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, a decision must be made as to whether the/uni00A0Bank has retained control of the financial asset.\n\nUpon derecognition, the/uni00A0Bank will record a gain or loss on sale of those assets which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, including any financial assets received or financial liabilities assumed, and any cumulative gains or losses allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. In determining the fair value of any financial assets received, the/uni00A0Bank estimates future cash flows by relying on estimates of the amount of interest that will be collected on the securitized assets, the yield to be paid to investors, the portion of the securitized assets that will be prepaid before their scheduled maturity, ECLs, the cost of servicing the assets, and the rate at which to discount these expected future cash flows. Actual cash flows may differ significantly from those estimated by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nRetained interests are financial interests in transferred assets retained by the/uni00A0Bank. They are classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at relative fair value on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the/uni00A0Bank's estimated future cash flows are recognized in trading income (loss). These assumptions are subject to periodic reviews and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment.\n\n## GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\n\nThe recoverable amount of the/uni00A0Bank's CGUs is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as forecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compared to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the/uni00A0Bank's CGUs are determined by management using risk-based capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). Any capital not directly attributable to the CGUs is held within the Corporate segment. The/uni00A0Bank's capital oversight committees provide oversight to the/uni00A0Bank's capital allocation methodologies.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nThe projected benefit obligation and expense related to the/uni00A0Bank's pension and post-retirement defined benefit plans are determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts. Actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates are management's best estimates and are reviewed annually with the/uni00A0Bank's actuaries. The/uni00A0Bank develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the/uni00A0Bank in conjunction with market-related data and considers if the marketrelated data indicates there is any prolonged or significant impact on the assumptions. The discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans' specific cash flows. The other assumptions are also long-term estimates. All assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Differences between actual experiences and the assumptions, as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations, result in remeasurement gains and losses which are recognized in other comprehensive income during the year and also impact expenses in future periods.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations in the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The/uni00A0Bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute, or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. These provisions are made using the/uni00A0Bank's best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date, changes in these liabilities could result from audits by the relevant taxing authorities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. The amount of the deferred tax asset recognized and considered realizable could, however, be reduced if projected income is not achieved due to various factors, such as unfavourable business conditions. If projected income is not expected to be achieved, the/uni00A0Bank would decrease its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes can be realized. The magnitude of the decrease is significantly influenced by the/uni00A0Bank's forecast of future profit generation, which determines the extent to which it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets.\n\n## PROVISIONS\n\nProvisions arise when there is some uncertainty in the timing or amount of a loss in the future. Provisions are based on the/uni00A0Bank's best estimate of all expenditures required to settle its present obligations, considering all relevant risks and uncertainties, as well as, when material, the effect of the time value of money.\n\nMany of the/uni00A0Bank's provisions relate to various legal actions that the/uni00A0Bank is involved in during the ordinary course of business. Legal provisions require the involvement of both the/uni00A0Bank's management and legal counsel when assessing the probability of a loss and estimating any monetary impact. Throughout the life of a provision, the/uni00A0Bank's management or legal counsel may learn of additional information that may impact its assessments about the probability of loss or about the estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts recognized. The/uni00A0Bank reviews its legal provisions on a caseby-case basis after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the/uni00A0Bank's experience, the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\n\nCertain of the/uni00A0Bank's provisions relate to restructuring initiatives initiated by the/uni00A0Bank. Restructuring provisions require management's best estimate, including forecasts of economic conditions. Throughout the life",

        "page_content": "of a provision, the/uni00A0Bank may become aware of additional information that may impact the assessment of amounts to be incurred. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\nThe assumptions used in establishing the/uni00A0Bank's insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes.\n\nFor property and casualty insurance, the ultimate cost of claims liabilities is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved.\n\nFor life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary.\n\nFurther information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note/uni00A022.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION OF STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nManagement judgment is required when assessing whether the/uni00A0Bank should consolidate an entity. For instance, it may not be feasible to determine if the/uni00A0Bank controls an entity solely through an assessment of voting rights for certain structured entities. In these cases, judgment is required to establish whether the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power over the key relevant activities of the entity and whether the/uni00A0Bank has the ability to use that power to absorb significant variable returns from the entity. If it is determined that the/uni00A0Bank has both decision-making power and significant variable returns from the entity, judgment is also used to determine whether any such power is exercised by the/uni00A0Bank as principal, on its own behalf, or as agent, on behalf of another counterparty.\n\nAssessing whether the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power includes understanding the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine its key economic activities. In this context, an entity's key economic activities are those which predominantly impact the economic performance of the entity. When the/uni00A0Bank has the current ability to direct the entity's key economic activities, it is considered to have decisionmaking power over the entity.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also evaluates its exposure to the variable returns of a structured entity in order to determine if it absorbs a significant proportion of the variable returns the entity is designed to create. As part of this evaluation, the/uni00A0Bank considers the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine whether it absorbs variable returns from the structured entity through its contractual holdings, which may take the form of securities issued by the entity, derivatives with the entity, or other arrangements such as guarantees, liquidity facilities, or lending commitments.\n\nIf the/uni00A0Bank has decision-making power over the entity and absorbs significant variable returns from the entity, it then determines if it is acting as principal or agent when exercising its decision-making power. Key factors considered include the scope of its decision-making power; the rights of other parties involved with the entity, including any rights to remove the/uni00A0Bank as decision-maker or rights to participate in key decisions; whether the rights of other parties are exercisable in practice; and the variable returns absorbed by the/uni00A0Bank and by other parties involved with the entity. When assessing consolidation, a presumption exists that the/uni00A0Bank exercises decision-making power as principal if it is also exposed to significant variable returns, unless an analysis of the factors above indicates otherwise.\n\nThe decisions above are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances relevant for the structured entity and related transaction(s) under consideration.\n\n## REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank applies judgment to determine the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations which affects the timing of revenue recognition, by evaluating the pattern in which the/uni00A0Bank transfers control of services promised to the customer. A performance obligation is satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the/uni00A0Bank performs the service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is generally recognized using the time-elapsed method which is based on time elapsed in proportion to the period over which the service is provided, for example, personal deposit account bundle fees. The time-elapsed method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of control for these services as control is transferred evenly to the customer when the/uni00A0Bank provides a stand-ready service or effort is expended evenly by the/uni00A0Bank to provide a service over the contract period. In contracts where the/uni00A0Bank has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the/uni00A0Bank's performance completed to date, the/uni00A0Bank recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank satisfies a performance obligation at a point in time if the customer obtains control of the promised services at that date. Determining when control is transferred requires the use of judgment. For transaction-based services, the/uni00A0Bank determines that control is transferred to the customer at a point in time when the customer obtains substantially all of the benefits from the service rendered and the/uni00A0Bank has a present right to payment, which generally coincides with the moment the transaction is executed.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank exercises judgment in determining whether costs incurred in connection with acquiring new revenue contracts would meet the requirement to be capitalized as incremental costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with customers.\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM PHASE 2\n\nEffective November/uni00A01, 2020, the/uni00A0Bank early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 and no transitional adjustment was required.\n\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 addresses issues affecting financial reporting when changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial instruments or hedging relationships as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments permit modification to financial assets, financial liabilities and lessee lease liabilities required as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the EIR prospectively. If the modification does not meet the practical expedient requirements, existing IFRS requirements are applied. Relief is also provided for an entity's hedge accounting relationships in circumstances where changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments enable entities to amend the formal designation and documentation of a hedging relationship to reflect these changes without discontinuing the hedging relationship or designating a new hedging relationship. Permitted changes include redefining the hedged risk to reference an ARR (contractually or noncontractually specified), amending the description of the hedged item and hedging instrument to reflect the ARR, and amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Hedging relationships within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 are the same as those within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase/uni00A01. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 also amended IFRS 7, introducing expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the risks arising from IBOR reform, how an entity is managing those risks, its progress in completing the transition to ARRs, and how it is managing the transition.\n\nThe global benchmark rate reform initiative to transition from IBOR benchmarks (such as London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) to ARRs may result in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the/uni00A0Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry. Market risks arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the existing benchmark rates which could result in different financial",

In order to manage these risks, the/uni00A0Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks.\n\nEffective December 31, 2021, the publication of LIBOR settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro settings as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings. The/uni00A0Bank is progressing on its transition plan for the remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month), which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023, and continues to monitor developments while incorporating global working group and regulator best practice guidance on transition activities. Global regulators have issued guidance and policy statements to supervised institutions restricting the use of USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts written after December 31, 2021, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs across the industry, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee's formal recommendation of the CME Group's forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Term Rates. To help support the transition of legacy derivative contracts, the/uni00A0Bank's registered swap dealer and four additional Bank affiliates have adhered to the 2020 International Swaps and Derivatives Association IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (ISDA Protocol). The ISDA Protocol, which took effect on January 25, 2021, provides an efficient transition mechanism for mutually adhering counterparties to incorporate prescribed fallback rates into legacy derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table discloses the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to significant interest rate benchmarks subject to IBOR reform that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 30, 2023 for USD LIBOR and after December/uni00A031, 2021 for other IBORs that were subject to transition, including certain demand loans that have no specific maturity. This also includes exposure to interest rate benchmarks subject to IBOR reform methodology enhancements that are not required to transition to an ARR.\n\n## Exposures to LIBOR and Other Rates Subject to Reform 1,2\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)       | As at                   | As at                   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                      | October/uni00A031  2022 | October/uni00A031  2021 |\n| Non-derivative financial assets 3    | $  88,988               | $  106,912              |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities | 604                     | 519                     |\n| Derivative notional amounts          | 4,386,899               | 4,380,555               |\n| Off-balance sheet commitments 4      | 70,772                  | 90,700                  |\n\nOn May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, the administrator of CDOR, announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. CDOR is currently the primary interest rate benchmark in Canada and is widely used in Canadian dollar financial instruments including derivatives, loans, floating rate notes, and as a daily benchmark reference rate for Canadian Bankers' Acceptance (BA) borrowings. The/uni00A0Bank has incorporated this development into its benchmark rate reform plan to ensure an orderly transition and to manage the impact through appropriate mitigating actions. These actions include incorporating appropriate fallback language in contracts, making available new products referencing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or other ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy CDOR-based contracts, and preparing for overall operational readiness.\n\nThe following table discloses the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to financial instruments referencing CDOR that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 28, 2024.\n\n## Exposures to CDOR Subject to Reform 1,2\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)         | As at                   | As at                |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                        | October/uni00A031  2022 | July/uni00A031  2022 |\n| Non-derivative financial assets 3      | $  10,742               | $  6,261             |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities 4 | 12,689                  | 12,965               |\n| Derivative notional amounts            | 3,066,690               | 2,693,607            |\n| Off-balance sheet commitments 5        | 42,022                  | 38,643               |",

Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous.\n\n## N O T E 5 | FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nCertain assets and liabilities, primarily financial instruments, are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value on a recurring basis. These financial instruments include trading loans and securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL, financial assets and liabilities designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, derivatives, certain securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, trading deposits, securitization liabilities at fair value, obligations related to securities sold short, and certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost.\n\n## (a) VALUATION GOVERNANCE\n\nValuation processes are guided by policies and procedures that are approved by senior management and subject matter experts. Senior Executive oversight over the valuation process is provided through various valuation committees. Further, the/uni00A0Bank has a number of additional controls in place, including an independent price verification process to ensure the accuracy of fair value measurements reported in the financial statements. The sources used for independent pricing comply with the standards set out in the approved valuation-related policies, which include consideration of the reliability, relevancy, and timeliness of data.\n\n## (b) METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank calculates fair value for measurement and disclosure purposes based on the following methods of valuation and assumptions:\n\n## Government and Government-Related Securities\n\nThe fair value of Canadian government debt securities is based on quoted prices in active markets, where available. Where quoted prices are not available, valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models may be used, which maximize the use of observable inputs such as government bond yield curves.\n\nThe fair value of U.S. government and agency debt securities is determined by reference to recent transaction prices, broker quotes, or third-party vendor prices. Brokers or third-party vendors may use a pool-specific valuation model to value these securities. Observable market inputs to the model include to-be-announced market prices, the applicable indices, and metrics such as the coupon, maturity, and weighted-average maturity of the pool. Market inputs used in the valuation model include, but are not limited to, indexed yield curves and trading spreads.\n\nThe fair value of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) government-guaranteed debt is based on broker quotes and third-party vendor prices, or where these quotes or prices are not readily available, other valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow models, may be used. Market inputs used in other valuation techniques or broker quotes and third-party vendor prices include government bond yield curves and trade execution data.\n\nThe standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November/uni00A01, 2023 for the/uni00A0Bank. OSFI's related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the/uni00A0Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is proceeding with implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and other implementation efforts accordingly.\n\nThe fair value of residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is based on broker quotes, third-party vendor prices, or other valuation techniques, such as the use of option-adjusted spread models which include inputs such as prepayment rate assumptions related to the underlying collateral. Observable inputs include, but are not limited to, indexed yield curves and bid-ask spreads. Other inputs may include volatility assumptions derived using Monte Carlo simulations and take into account factors such as counterparty credit quality and liquidity.\n\n## Other Debt Securities\n\nThe fair value of corporate and other debt securities is based on broker quotes, third-party vendor prices, or other valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow techniques. Market inputs used in the other valuation techniques or underlying third-party vendor prices or broker quotes include benchmark and government bond yield curves, credit spreads, and trade execution data.\n\nAsset-backed securities are primarily fair valued using third-party vendor prices. The third-party vendor employs a valuation model which maximizes the use of observable inputs such as benchmark yield curves and bid-ask spreads. The model also takes into account relevant data about the underlying collateral, such as weighted-average terms to maturity and prepayment rate assumptions.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is based on quoted prices in active markets, where available. Where quoted prices in active markets are not readily available, such as for private equity securities, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread, fair value is determined based on quoted market prices for similar securities or through valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, multiples of earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other relevant valuation techniques.\n\nIf there are trading restrictions on the equity security held, a valuation adjustment is recognized against available prices to reflect the nature of the restriction. However, restrictions that are not part of the security held and represent a separate contractual arrangement that has been entered into by the/uni00A0Bank and a third party do not impact the fair value of the original instrument.\n\n## Retained Interests\n\nRetained interests are classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at their relative fair market value. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests recognized by the/uni00A0Bank is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the/uni00A0Bank's estimate of future cash flows are recognized in income. These assumptions are subject to periodic review and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment.",

For fixed-rate performing loans, estimated fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows related to these loans at current market interest rates for loans with similar credit risks. For floating-rate performing loans, changes in interest rates have minimal impact on fair value since loans reprice to market frequently. On that basis, fair value is assumed to approximate carrying value. The fair value of loans is not adjusted for the value of any credit protection the/uni00A0Bank has purchased to mitigate credit risk.\n\nThe fair value of loans carried at FVTPL, which includes trading loans and non-trading loans at FVTPL, is determined using observable market prices, where available. Where the/uni00A0Bank is a market maker for loans traded in the secondary market, fair value is determined using executed prices, or prices for comparable trades. For those loans where the/uni00A0Bank is not a market maker, the/uni00A0Bank obtains broker quotes from other reputable dealers, or uses valuation techniques to determine fair value.\n\nThe fair value of loans carried at FVOCI is assumed to approximate amortized cost as they are generally floating rate performing loans that are short term in nature.\n\n## Commodities\n\nThe fair value of commodities is based on quoted prices in active markets, where available. The/uni00A0Bank also transacts commodity derivative contracts which can be traded on an exchange or in OTC markets.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivative financial instruments is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments is estimated using well established valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow techniques, the Black-Scholes model, and Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation models incorporate inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.\n\nPrices derived by using models are recognized net of valuation adjustments. The inputs used in the valuation models depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and are specific to the instrument being valued. Inputs can include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, dividend yield projections, commodity spot and forward prices, recovery rates, volatilities, spot prices, and correlation.\n\nA credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is recognized against the model value of OTC derivatives to account for the uncertainty that either counterparty in a derivative transaction may not be able to fulfil its obligations under the transaction. In determining CVA, the/uni00A0Bank takes into account master netting agreements and collateral, and considers the creditworthiness of the counterparty and of the/uni00A0Bank itself, using market observed or proxy credit spreads, in assessing potential future amounts owed to, or by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nThe fair value of a derivative is partly a function of collateralization. The/uni00A0Bank uses the relevant overnight index swap curve to discount the cash flows for collateralized derivatives as most collateral is posted in cash and can be funded at the overnight rate.\n\nA funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is recognized against the model value of OTC derivatives to recognize the market implied unsecured funding costs and benefits considered in the pricing and fair value determination. Some of the key drivers of FVA include the market implied funding spread and the expected average exposure by counterparty.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank will continue to monitor industry practice on valuation adjustments and may refine the methodology as market practices evolve.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe estimated fair value of term deposits is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using interest rates currently offered for deposits with similar terms.\n\nFor deposits with no defined maturities, the/uni00A0Bank considers fair value to equal carrying value, which is equivalent to the amount payable on the balance sheet date.\n\nFor trading deposits and deposits designated at FVTPL, which is included in financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market inputs such as benchmark yield curves and foreign exchange rates. The/uni00A0Bank considers the impact of its own creditworthiness in the valuation of these deposits by reference to observable market inputs.\n\n## Securitization Liabilities\n\nThe fair value of securitization liabilities is based on quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar financial instruments, where available. Where quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, which maximize the use of observable inputs, such as Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) curves and MBS curves.\n\n## Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short\n\nThe fair value of these obligations is based on the fair value of the underlying securities, which can include equity or debt securities. As these obligations are fully collateralized, the method used to determine fair value would be the same as that of the relevant underlying equity or debt securities.\n\n## Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Under Repurchase/uni00A0Agreements\n\nCommodities and certain bonds and equities purchased or sold with an agreement to sell or repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price are carried at fair value. The fair value of these agreements is based on valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models which maximize the use of observable market inputs such as interest rate swap curves and commodity forward prices.\n\n## Subordinated Notes and Debentures\n\nThe fair value of subordinated notes and debentures are based on quoted market prices for similar issuances or current rates offered to the/uni00A0Bank for debt of equivalent credit quality and remaining maturity.\n\n## Portfolio Exception\n\nIFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement provides a measurement exception that allows an entity to determine the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities with offsetting risks based on the sale or transfer of its net exposure to a particular risk or risks. The/uni00A0Bank manages certain financial assets and financial liabilities, such as derivative assets and derivative liabilities, on the basis of net exposure to a particular risk, or risks; and uses mid-market prices as a basis for establishing fair values for the offsetting risk positions and applies the most representative price within the bid-ask spread to the net open position, as appropriate. Refer to Note/uni00A02 for further details on the use of the portfolio exception to establish fair value.\n\n## (c) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nThe carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value are disclosed in the table below. For these instruments, fair values are calculated for disclosure purposes only, using the valuation techniques used by the/uni00A0Bank. In addition, the/uni00A0Bank has determined that the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value, which include: cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers' liability under acceptances, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, other assets, acceptances, amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients, and other liabilities. Substantially all securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements are measured at amortized cost where the carrying value approximates their fair value.",

The three levels are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 : Fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in an active exchange market or highly liquid and actively traded in OTC markets.\n\nLevel 2 : Fair value is based on observable inputs other than Level/uni00A01 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar (but not identical) assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts\n\nwhose value is determined using valuation techniques with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 : Fair value is based on non-observable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially recognized at their transaction price, which is considered the best estimate of fair value. After initial measurement, the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities is determined using valuation models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy for Assets and Liabilities not carried at Fair Value\n\nThe following table presents the levels within the fair value hierarchy for each of the financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021, but for which fair value is disclosed.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy for Assets and Liabilities not carried at Fair Value 1\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                |         |             |           |             |         |             |           | As at       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n|                                                                               | Level 1 | Level 2     | Level 3   | Total       | Level 1 | Level 2     | Level 3   | Total       |\n| ASSETS                                                                        |         |             |           |             |         |             |           |             |\n| Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance   for credit losses       |         |             |           |             |         |             |           |             |\n| Government and government-related securities                                  | $  -    | $  244,513  | $  10     | $  244,523  | $  20   | $  207,897  | $  10     | $  207,927  |\n| Other debt securities                                                         | -       | 81,912      | 1         | 81,913      | -       | 60,524      | 1         | 60,525      |\n| Total debt securities at amortized cost,   net of allowance for credit losses | -       | 326,425     | 11        | 326,436     | 20      | 268,421     | 11        | 268,452     |\n| Total loans, net of allowance for loan losses                                 | -       | 261,618     | 549,294   | 810,912     | -       | 251,034     | 474,143   | 725,177     |\n| Total assets with fair value disclosures                                      | $  -    | $  588,043  | $ 549,305 | $ 1,137,348 | $  20   | $  519,455  | $ 474,154 | $  993,629  |\n| LIABILITIES                                                                   |         |             |           |             |         |             |           |             |\n| Deposits                                                                      | $  -    | $ 1,218,552 | $  -      | $ 1,218,552 | $  -    | $ 1,124,762 | $  -      | $ 1,124,762 |\n| Securitization liabilities at amortized cost                                  | -       | 14,366      | -         | 14,366      | -       | 15,202      | -         | 15,202      |\n| Subordinated notes and debentures                                             | -       | 10,853      | -         | 10,853      | -       | 11,838      | -         | 11,838      |\n| Total liabilities with fair value disclosures                                 | $  -    | $ 1,243,771 | $  -      | $ 1,243,771 | $  -    | $ 1,151,802 | $  -      | $ 1,151,802 |",

Assets are transferred between Level/uni00A01 and Level/uni00A02 depending on whether there is sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank transferred $383/uni00A0million of FVOCI U.S. government debt from Level/uni00A01 to Level/uni00A02. During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2021, the/uni00A0Bank transferred $400/uni00A0million of FVOCI Canadian government debt from Level/uni00A02 to Level/uni00A01, which subsequently matured.\n\n## Movements of Level 3 instruments\n\nSignificant transfers into and out of Level 3 occur mainly due to the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 occur when techniques used for valuing the instrument incorporate significant observable market inputs or broker-dealer quotes which were previously not observable.\n- \u00b7 Transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 occur when an instrument's fair value, which was previously determined using valuation techniques with significant observable market inputs, is now determined using valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs.\n\nDue to the unobservable nature of the inputs used to value Level/uni00A03 financial instruments, there may be uncertainty about the valuation of these instruments. The fair value of Level 3 instruments may be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In determining the appropriate levels for these unobservable inputs, parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and management judgment.\n\nThere were no significant transfers between Level 2 and Level/uni00A03 during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022. During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2021, transfers were made from Level/uni00A03 to Level/uni00A02 for trading deposits and equity contracts due to changes in the degree of observability of certain inputs in the fair value measurement of these instruments.\n\nThere were no other significant changes to the unobservable inputs and sensitivities for assets and liabilities classified as Level/uni00A03 during the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## (f) RECONCILIATION OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL/uni00A03 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nThe following tables reconcile changes in fair value of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant Level/uni00A03 unobservable inputs for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.",

For debt securities, the price equivalent is expressed in 'points', and represents a percentage of the par amount. For equity securities, the price equivalent is based on a percentage of a proxy price. There may be wide ranges depending on the liquidity of the securities. New issuances of debt and equity securities are priced at 100% of the issue price.\n\n## Correlation\n\nThe movements of inputs are not necessarily independent from other inputs. Such relationships, where material to the fair value of a given instrument, are captured via correlation inputs into the pricing models. The/uni00A0Bank includes correlation between the asset class, as well as across asset classes. For example, price correlation is the relationship between prices of equity securities in equity basket derivatives, and quanto correlation is the relationship between instruments which settle in one currency and the underlying securities which are denominated in another currency.\n\n## Implied Volatility\n\nImplied volatility is the value of the volatility of the underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model, such as Black-Scholes, will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option. Implied volatility is a forward-looking and subjective measure, and differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security.\n\n## Funding ratio\n\nThe funding ratio is a significant unobservable input required to value loan commitments issued by the/uni00A0Bank. The funding ratio represents an estimate of the percentage of commitments that are ultimately funded by the/uni00A0Bank. The funding ratio is based on a number of factors such as observed\n\n- 6 Issuances and repurchases of trading deposits are reported on a gross basis.\n- 7 Consists of derivative assets of $50 million (October/uni00A031, 2021/November 1, 2021 $47 million; November 1, 2020 - $381 million) and derivative liabilities of/uni00A0$234/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021/November 1, 2021 - $179 million; November/uni00A01, 2020 - $1,200 million), which have been netted in this table for/uni00A0presentation purposes only.\n\nhistorical funding percentages within the various lending channels and the future economic outlook, considering factors including, but not limited to, competitive pricing and fixed/variable mortgage rate gap. An increase/ decrease in the funding ratio will increase/decrease loan commitment liability values in relationship to prevailing interest rates.\n\n## Earnings Multiple, Discount Rate, and Liquidity Discount\n\nEarnings multiple, discount rate, and liquidity discount are significant inputs used when valuing certain equity securities. Earnings multiples are selected based on comparable entities and a higher multiple will result in a higher fair value. Discount rates are applied to cash flow forecasts to reflect time value of money and the risks associated with the cash flows. A higher discount rate will result in a lower fair value. Liquidity discounts may be applied as a result of the difference in liquidity between the comparable entity and the equity securities being valued.\n\n## Dividend Yield\n\nDividend yield is a key input for valuing equity contracts and is generally expressed as a percentage of the current price of the stock. Dividend yields can be derived from the repo or forward price of the actual stock being fair valued. Spot dividend yields can also be obtained from pricing sources, if it can be demonstrated that spot yields are a good indication of future dividends.\n\n## Inflation Rate Swap Curve\n\nThe fair value of inflation rate swap contracts is a swap between the interest rate curve and the inflation index. The inflation rate swap spread is not observable and is determined using proxy inputs such as inflation index rates and Consumer Price Index (CPI) bond yields. Generally, swap curves are observable; however, there may be instances where certain specific swap curves are not observable.\n\n## Net Asset Value\n\nThe fair value of certain private funds is based on the net asset value determined by the fund managers based on valuation methodologies, as there are no observable prices for these instruments.",

For non-trading securities at FVTPL and equity securities at FVOCI, the sensitivity was calculated based on an upward and downward shock of the fair value reported. For trading deposits, the sensitivity was calculated by varying unobservable inputs which may include volatility,\n\ncredit spreads, and correlation. For interest rate derivatives, the/uni00A0Bank performed a sensitivity analysis on the unobservable implied volatility. For equity derivatives, the sensitivity was calculated by using reasonably possible alternative assumptions by shocking dividends, correlation, or the price and volatility of the underlying equity instrument. For financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, the sensitivity was calculated based on an upward and downward shock of the funding ratio.",

The actuarial valuation of the insurance reserve is measured using a discount factor which is based on the yield of the supporting invested assets, which includes the securities designated at FVTPL, with changes in the discount factor being recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The\n\nunrealized gains or losses on securities designated at FVTPL are recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period as gains or losses resulting from changes to the discount rate used to value the insurance liabilities.\n\nIn addition, certain debt securities have been designated at FVTPL as they are economically hedged with derivatives and the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\n## Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss\n\nCertain deposits have been designated at FVTPL to reduce an accounting mismatch from related economic hedges, and are included in Financial liabilities designated at FVTPL on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements have been designated at FVTPL as the instruments are part of a portfolio that is managed on a fair value basis and have been included in Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements designated at FVTPL was $5,014/uni00A0million as at October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 $1,491/uni00A0million).\n\nFor financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, the estimated amount that the/uni00A0Bank would be contractually required to pay at maturity, which is based on notional amounts, was $288/uni00A0million less than its fair value as at October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $9/uni00A0million).\n\n## N O T E 6 | OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank enters into netting agreements with counterparties (such as clearing houses) to manage the credit risks associated primarily with repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, securities borrowing and lending transactions, and OTC and exchange-traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally allow the counterparties to set-off liabilities against available assets received. The right to set-off is a legal right to settle or otherwise eliminate all or a portion of an amount due by applying against that amount an amount receivable from the other party. These agreements effectively reduce the/uni00A0Bank's credit exposure by what it would have been if those same counterparties were liable for the gross exposure on the same underlying contracts.\n\nNetting arrangements are typically constituted by a master netting agreement which specifies the general terms of the agreement between the counterparties, including information on the basis of the netting calculation, types of collateral, and the definition of default and other termination events for transactions executed under the agreement. The master netting agreements contain the terms and conditions by which all\n\n(or as many as possible) relevant transactions between the counterparties are governed. Multiple individual transactions are subsumed under this general master netting agreement, forming a single legal contract under which the counterparties conduct their relevant mutual business. In addition to the mitigation of credit risk, placing individual transactions under a single master netting agreement that provides for netting of transactions in scope also helps to mitigate settlement risks associated with transacting in multiple jurisdictions or across multiple contracts. These arrangements include clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the/uni00A0Bank enters into contracts to buy and sell goods and services from various suppliers. Some of these contracts may have netting provisions that allow for the offset of various trade payables and receivables in the event of default of one of the parties. While these are not disclosed in the following table, the gross amount of all payables and receivables to and from the/uni00A0Bank's vendors is disclosed in Note/uni00A016 in accounts receivable and other items, and in Note/uni00A018 in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other items.",

Some of these transactions may have netting provisions that allow for the offset of broker payables and broker receivables related to these purchases and sales. While these are not disclosed in the following table, the amount of receivables are disclosed in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and payables are disclosed in amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the financial assets and liabilities which are subject to enforceable master netting agreements and similar arrangements, including amounts not otherwise set-off on\n\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as financial collateral received to mitigate credit exposures for these financial assets and liabilities. The gross financial assets and liabilities are reconciled to net amounts and are presented within the associated line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, after transactions with the same counterparties have been offset. Related amounts and collateral received that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are otherwise subject to the same enforceable netting agreements and similar arrangements, are then presented to arrive at a net amount.\n\n## Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                       |

Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note/uni00A03 for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs.\n\n- 4 The allowance for loan losses for off-balance sheet instruments is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Macroeconomic Variables\n\nSelect macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the/uni00A0Bank's ECLs as at October/uni00A031, 2022. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Ongoing geopolitical tensions, and heightened inflationary pressures, which have led to a rapid tightening in monetary policy continue to contribute to elevated economic uncertainty, leading to deterioration in our economic forecasts.",

macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs.\n\nThe following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts.\n\n## Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars,   except as noted)   | As at            | As at            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                     | October 31, 2022 | October 31, 2021 |\n| Probability-weighted ECLs                           | $ 6,599          | $ 6,608          |\n| Base ECLs                                           | 6,095            | 6,412            |\n| Difference - in amount                              | $  504           | $  196           |\n| Difference - in percentage                          | 8.3%             | 3.1%             |\n\nECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve-month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant.",

The following table summarizes loans that are past due but not impaired. Loans less than 31 days contractually past due are excluded as they do not generally reflect a borrower's ability to meet their payment obligations.\n\n## Loans Past Due but not Impaired 1\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)         | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at            |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                        | October 31, 2022 | October 31, 2022 | October 31, 2022 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 |\n|                                        | 31-60 days       | 61-89 days       | Total            | 31-60 days       | 61-89 days       | Total            |\n| Residential mortgages                  | $  230           | $  69            | $  299           | $  229           | $  62            | $  291           |\n| Consumer instalment and other personal | 668              | 204              | 872              | 512              | 156              | 668              |\n| Credit card                            | 271              | 172              | 443              | 186              | 113              | 299              |\n| Business and government                | 654              | 162              | 816              | 785              | 139              | 924              |\n| Total                                  | $  1,823         | $  607           | $  2,430         | $  1,712         | $  470           | $  2,182         |\n\n## (j) MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe amortized cost of financial assets with lifetime allowance that were modified during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, was $296/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $489/uni00A0million) before modification, with insignificant modification gain or loss. The gross carrying amount of modified financial assets for which the loss allowance changed from lifetime to twelvemonth ECLs during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022 was $686/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $1.1 billion).\n\nN O T E 9\n\n|\n\n## TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\n## LOAN SECURITIZATIONS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank securitizes loans through structured entity or non-structured entity third parties. Most loan securitizations do not qualify for derecognition since in most circumstances, the/uni00A0Bank continues to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate, and/or credit risk associated with the securitized financial assets and has not transferred substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership of the securitized assets. Where loans do not qualify for derecognition, they are not derecognized from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet, retained interests are not recognized, and a securitization liability is recognized for the cash proceeds received. Certain transaction costs incurred are also capitalized and amortized using EIRM.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank securitizes insured residential mortgages under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The MBS that are created through the NHA MBS program are sold to the Canada Housing Trust (CHT) as part of the CMB program, sold to third-party investors, or are held by the/uni00A0Bank. The CHT issues CMB to third-party investors and uses resulting proceeds to purchase NHA MBS from\n\n## (k) COLLATERAL\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, the collateral held against total gross impaired loans represents 78% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 83%) of total gross impaired loans. The fair value of non-financial collateral is determined at the origination date of the loan. A revaluation of non-financial collateral is performed if there has been a significant change in the terms and conditions of the loan and/or the loan is considered impaired. Management considers the nature of the collateral, seniority ranking of the debt, and loan structure in assessing the value of collateral. These estimated cash flows are reviewed at least annually, or more frequently when new information indicates a change in the timing or amount expected to be received.\n\nthe/uni00A0Bank and other mortgage issuers in the Canadian market. Assets purchased by the CHT are comingled in a single trust from which CMB are issued. The/uni00A0Bank continues to be exposed to substantially all of the risks of the underlying mortgages, through the retention of a seller swap which transfers principal and interest payment risk on the NHA MBS back to the/uni00A0Bank in return for coupon paid on the CMB issuance and as such, the sales do not qualify for derecognition.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank securitizes U.S. originated residential mortgages with U.S. government agencies which qualify for derecognition from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. As part of the securitization, the/uni00A0Bank retains the right to service the transferred mortgage loans. The MBS that are created through the securitization are typically sold to third-party investors.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also securitizes business and government loans to entities which may be structured entities. These securitizations may give rise to derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction.\n\nIn addition, the/uni00A0Bank transfers credit card receivables to structured entities that the/uni00A0Bank consolidates.

These transferred assets are not derecognized and the transfers are accounted for as financing transactions. The most common transactions of this nature are repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements, in which the/uni00A0Bank retains substantially all of the associated credit, price, interest rate, and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets.\n\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount of financial assets and the associated transactions that did not qualify for derecognition, as well as their associated financial liabilities as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Other Financial Assets Not Qualifying for Derecognition\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)              | October 31 2022   | As at October 31 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Carrying amount of assets                   |                   |                         |\n| Nature of transaction                       |                   |                         |\n| Repurchase agreements 1,2                   | $ 26,104          | $ 20,849                |\n| Securities lending agreements               | 45,667            | 44,234                  |\n| Total                                       | 71,771            | 65,083                  |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities 2 | $ 26,609          | $ 20,871                |\n\n## TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS QUALIFYING FOR DERECOGNITION\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety where the/uni00A0Bank has a continuing involvement\n\nContinuing involvement may arise if the/uni00A0Bank retains any contractual rights or obligations subsequent to the transfer of financial assets. Certain business and government loans securitized by the/uni00A0Bank are derecognized from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In instances where the/uni00A0Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the/uni00A0Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through a retained interest.\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, the fair value of retained interests was $5/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $9/uni00A0million). A gain or loss on sale of the loans is recognized immediately in other income (loss) after considering the effect of hedge accounting on the assets sold, if applicable. The amount of the gain or loss recognized depends on the previous carrying values of the loans involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the trading income recognized on the retained interest was nil (October/uni00A031, 2021 - nil).\n\nCertain portfolios of U.S. residential mortgages originated by the/uni00A0Bank are sold and derecognized from the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain instances, the/uni00A0Bank has a continuing involvement to service those loans. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, the carrying value of these servicing rights was $103/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $87/uni00A0million) and the fair value was $155/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $93/uni00A0million). A gain or loss on sale of the loans is recognized immediately in other income (loss). The gain (loss) on sale of the loans for the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022 was ($68)/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $66/uni00A0million).\n\n## Canada Emergency Business Account Program\n\nUnder the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program, which was funded by the Government of Canada and Export Development Canada as the Government of Canada's agent, the/uni00A0Bank provided eligible business banking customers with an interest-free, partially forgivable loan of up to $60,000. On January 12, 2022, it was announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness was extended from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing. If the loan is not repaid by December/uni00A031, 2023, it will be extended for an additional 2-year term bearing an interest rate of 5% per annum. The application window for new CEBA loans and expansion requests closed on June 30, 2021. The funding provided to the/uni00A0Bank by the Government of Canada in respect of the CEBA Program represents an obligation to pass-through collections on the CEBA loans and is otherwise non-recourse to the/uni00A0Bank. Accordingly, the/uni00A0Bank is required to remit all collections of principal and interest on the CEBA loans to the Government of Canada but is not required to repay amounts that its customers fail to pay or that have been forgiven. The/uni00A0Bank receives an administration fee to recover the costs to administer the program for the Government of Canada. Loans issued under the program are not recognized on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the/uni00A0Bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards in respect of the loans to the Government of Canada.",

        "page_content": "|\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank uses structured entities for a variety of purposes including: (1) to facilitate the transfer of specified risks to clients; (2) as financing vehicles for itself or for clients; or (3) to segregate assets on behalf of investors. The/uni00A0Bank is typically restricted from accessing the assets of the structured entity under the relevant arrangements.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is involved with structured entities that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Factors assessed when determining if the/uni00A0Bank is the sponsor of a structured entity include whether the/uni00A0Bank is the predominant user of the entity; whether the entity's branding or marketing identity is linked with the/uni00A0Bank; and whether the/uni00A0Bank provides an implicit or explicit guarantee of the entity's performance to investors or other third parties. The/uni00A0Bank is not considered to be the sponsor of a structured entity if it only provides arm's-length services to the entity, for example, by acting as administrator, distributor, custodian, asset manager, or loan servicer. Sponsorship of a structured entity may indicate that the/uni00A0Bank had power over the entity at inception; however, this is not sufficient to determine if the/uni00A0Bank consolidates the entity. Regardless of whether or not the/uni00A0Bank sponsors an entity, consolidation is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## (a) SPONSORED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nThe following section outlines the/uni00A0Bank's involvement with key sponsored structured entities.\n\n## Securitizations\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank securitizes its own assets and facilitates the securitization of client assets through structured entities, such as conduits, which issue ABCP or other securitization entities which issue longer-dated term securities. Securitizations are an important source of liquidity for the/uni00A0Bank, allowing it to diversify its funding sources and to optimize its balance sheet management approach.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank sponsors both single-seller and multi-seller securitization conduits. Depending on the specifics of the entity, the variable returns absorbed through ABCP may be significantly mitigated by variable returns retained by the sellers. The/uni00A0Bank provides liquidity facilities to certain conduits for the benefit of ABCP investors which are structured as loan facilities between the/uni00A0Bank, as the sole liquidity lender, and the/uni00A0Banksponsored entity. If an entity experiences difficulty issuing ABCP due to illiquidity in the commercial market, the entity may draw on the loan facility, and use the proceeds to pay maturing ABCP. The ABCP issued by each multi-seller conduit is in the conduit's own name with recourse to the financial assets owned by the multi-seller conduit, and is non-recourse to the/uni00A0Bank except through our participation in liquidity facilities. The/uni00A0Bank's exposure to the variable returns of these conduits from its provision of liquidity facilities and any related commitments is mitigated by the sellers' continued exposure to variable returns, as described below. The/uni00A0Bank provides administration and securities distribution services to its sponsored securitization conduits, which may result in it holding an investment in the ABCP issued by these entities. In some cases, the/uni00A0Bank may also provide credit enhancements or may transact derivatives with securitization conduits. The/uni00A0Bank earns fees from the conduits which are recognized when earned.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank sells assets to single-seller conduits which it controls and consolidates. Control results from the/uni00A0Bank's power over the entity's key economic decisions, predominantly, the mix of assets sold into the conduit and exposure to the variable returns of the transferred assets, usually through a derivative or the provision of credit mitigation in the form of cash reserves, over-collateralization, or guarantees over the performance of the entity's portfolio of assets.\n\nMulti-seller conduits provide sellers with alternate sources of financing through the securitization of their assets. These conduits are similar to single-seller conduits except that financial assets are purchased from more than one seller and commingled into a single portfolio of assets.\n\nEach transaction is structured with transaction-specific first loss protection provided by the third-party seller. This enhancement can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The/uni00A0Bank is typically deemed to have power over the entity's key economic decisions, namely, the selection of sellers and related assets sold as well as other decisions related to the management of risk in the vehicle. The/uni00A0Bank's exposure to the variable returns of multi-seller conduits from its provision of liquidity facilities and any related commitments is mitigated by the sellers' continued exposure to variable returns from the entity. Where the/uni00A0Bank has power over multi-seller conduits, but is not exposed to significant variable returns it does not consolidate such entities. Where the/uni00A0Bank is exposed to variable returns of a multi-seller conduit from provision of liquidity facilities, together with power over the entity as well as the ability to use its power to influence significant variable returns, the/uni00A0Bank consolidates the conduit.\n\n## Investment Funds and Other Asset Management Entities\n\nAs part of its asset management business, the/uni00A0Bank creates investment funds and trusts (including mutual funds), enabling it to provide its clients with a broad range of diversified exposure to different risk profiles, in accordance with the client's risk appetite. Such entities may be actively managed or may be passively directed, for example, through the tracking of a specified index, depending on the entity's investment strategy. Financing for these entities is obtained through the issuance of securities to investors, typically in the form of fund units. Based on each entity's specific strategy and risk profile, the proceeds from this issuance are used by the entity to purchase a portfolio of assets. An entity's portfolio may contain investments in securities, derivatives, or other assets, including cash. At the inception of a new investment fund or trust, the/uni00A0Bank will typically invest an amount of seed capital in the entity, allowing it to establish a performance history in the market. Over time, the/uni00A0Bank sells its seed capital holdings to third-party investors, as the entity's AUM increases. As a result, the/uni00A0Bank's holding of seed capital investment in its own sponsored investment funds and trusts is typically not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aside from any seed capital investments, the/uni00A0Bank's interest in these entities is generally limited to fees earned for the provision of asset management services. The/uni00A0Bank does not typically provide guarantees over the performance of these funds.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is typically considered to have power over the key economic decisions of sponsored asset management entities; however, it does not consolidate an entity unless it is also exposed to significant variable returns of the entity. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's consolidation policy.\n\n## Financing Vehicles\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank may use structured entities to provide a cost-effective means of financing its operations, including raising capital or obtaining funding. These structured entities include TD Covered Bond (Legislative) Guarantor Limited Partnership (the 'Covered Bond Entity'). Previously, these structured entities also included TD Capital Trust IV ('Trust IV').\n\nTrust IV issued innovative capital securities which counted as Tier 1 Capital of the/uni00A0Bank. The proceeds from these issuances were invested in bank deposit notes which generated income for distribution to investors. Trust IV held assets which were only exposed to the/uni00A0Bank's own credit risk. The/uni00A0Bank was considered to have decision-making power over the key economic activities of Trust IV; however, the/uni00A0Bank did not consolidate the trust because it did not absorb significant variable returns of the trust as it was ultimately exposed only to its own credit risk. On November/uni00A01, 2021, Trust IV redeemed all of the outstanding $450/uni00A0million TD Capital Trust IV Notes - Series 2. On December 8, 2021, Trust IV was dissolved. Refer to Note/uni00A020 for further details.",

        "page_content": "The/uni00A0Bank issues, or has issued, debt under its covered bond program where the principal and interest payments of the notes are guaranteed by the Covered Bond Entity. The/uni00A0Bank sold a portfolio of assets to the Covered Bond Entity and provided a loan to the Covered Bond Entity to facilitate the purchase. The/uni00A0Bank is restricted from accessing the Covered Bond Entity's assets under the relevant agreement. Investors in the/uni00A0Bank's covered bonds may have recourse to the/uni00A0Bank should the assets of the Covered Bond Entity be insufficient to satisfy the covered bond liabilities. The/uni00A0Bank consolidates the Covered Bond Entity as it has power over the key economic activities and retains all the variable returns in this entity.\n\n## (b) THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nIn addition to structured entities sponsored by the/uni00A0Bank, the/uni00A0Bank is also involved with structured entities sponsored by third parties. Key involvement with third-party sponsored structured entities is described in the following section.\n\n## Third-party Sponsored Securitization Programs\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank participates in the securitization program of governmentsponsored structured entities, including the CMHC, a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada, and similar U.S. government-sponsored entities. The CMHC guarantees CMB issued through the CHT.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is exposed to the variable returns in the CHT, through its retention of seller swaps resulting from its participation in the CHT program. The/uni00A0Bank does not have power over the CHT as its key economic activities are controlled by the Government of Canada. The/uni00A0Bank's exposure to the CHT is included in the balance of residential mortgage loans as noted in Note/uni00A09, and is not disclosed in the table accompanying this Note.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank participates in the securitization programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies. The/uni00A0Bank is not exposed to significant variable returns from these agencies and does not have power over the key economic activities of these agencies, which are controlled by the U.S. government.\n\n## Investment Holdings and Derivatives\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank may hold interests in third-party structured entities, predominantly in the form of direct investments in securities or partnership interests issued by those structured entities, or through derivatives transacted with counterparties which are structured entities. Investments in, and derivatives with, structured entities are recognized on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The/uni00A0Bank does not typically consolidate thirdparty structured entities where its involvement is limited to investment holdings and/or derivatives as the/uni00A0Bank would not generally have power over the key economic decisions of these entities.\n\n## Financing Transactions\n\nIn the normal course of business, the/uni00A0Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities including commercial loans, reverse repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the/uni00A0Bank to the structured entities' counterparty credit risk, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The/uni00A0Bank typically has neither power nor significant variable returns due to financing transactions with structured entities and would not generally consolidate such entities. Financing transactions with third-party sponsored structured entities are included on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements and have not been included in the table accompanying this Note.\n\n## Arm's-length Servicing Relationships\n\nIn addition to the involvement outlined above, the/uni00A0Bank may also provide services to structured entities on an arm's-length basis, for example as sub-advisor to an investment fund or asset servicer. Similarly, the/uni00A0Bank's asset management services provided to institutional investors may include transactions with structured entities. As a consequence of providing these services, the/uni00A0Bank may be exposed to variable returns from these structured entities, for example, through the receipt of fees or short-term exposure to the structured entity's securities. Any such exposure is typically mitigated by collateral or some other contractual arrangement with the structured entity or its sponsor. The/uni00A0Bank generally has neither power nor significant variable returns from the provision of arm's-length services to a structured entity and, consequently does not consolidate such entities. Fees and other exposures through servicing relationships are included on the/uni00A0Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements and have not been included in the table accompanying this Note.\n\n## (c) INVOLVEMENT WITH CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES Securitizations\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank securitizes credit card receivables through securitization entities, predominantly single-seller conduits. These conduits are consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank based on the factors described above. Aside from the exposure resulting from its involvement as seller and sponsor of consolidated securitization conduits described above, including the liquidity facilities provided, the/uni00A0Bank has no contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to consolidated securitization conduits. The/uni00A0Bank's interests in securitization conduits generally rank senior to interests held by other parties, in accordance with the/uni00A0Bank's investment and risk policies. As a result, the/uni00A0Bank has no significant obligations to absorb losses before other holders of securitization issuances.\n\n## Other Structured Consolidated Structured Entities\n\nDepending on the specific facts and circumstances of the/uni00A0Bank's involvement with structured entities, the/uni00A0Bank may consolidate asset management entities, financing vehicles, or third-party sponsored structured entities, based on the factors described above. Aside from its exposure resulting from its involvement as sponsor or investor in the structured entities as previously discussed, the/uni00A0Bank does not typically have other contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to these consolidated structured entities.\n\n## (d) INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nThe following table presents information related to the/uni00A0Bank's unconsolidated structured entities. Unconsolidated structured entities include both TD and third-party sponsored entities. Securitizations include holdings in TD-sponsored multi-seller conduits, as well as thirdparty sponsored mortgage and asset-backed securitizations, including government-sponsored agency securities such as CMBs, and U.S. government agency issuances. Investment Funds and Trusts include holdings in third-party funds and trusts, as well as holdings in TDsponsored asset management funds and trusts and commitments to certain U.S. municipal funds. Amounts in Other are predominantly related to investments in community-based U.S. tax-advantage entities described in Note/uni00A012. These holdings do not result in the consolidation of these entities as TD does not have power over these entities.",

The/uni00A0Bank would not typically hold investments, with the exception of seed capital, in these structured entities. However, the/uni00A0Bank continues to earn fees from asset management services provided to these entities, some of which could be based on the performance of the fund. Fees payable are generally senior in the entity's priority of payment and would also be backed by collateral, limiting the/uni00A0Bank's exposure to loss from\n\n## N O T E 1 1 | DERIVATIVES\n\n## (a) DERIVATIVE PRODUCT TYPES AND RISK EXPOSURES\n\nThe majority of the/uni00A0Bank's derivative contracts are OTC transactions that are bilaterally negotiated between the/uni00A0Bank and the counterparty to the contract. The remainder are exchange-traded contracts transacted through organized and regulated exchanges and consist primarily of options and futures.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's derivative transactions relate to trading and non-trading activities. The purpose of derivatives held for non-trading activities is primarily for managing interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity risk related to the/uni00A0Bank's funding, lending, investment, and other structural market risk management activities. The/uni00A0Bank's risk management strategy\n\n- 3 The size of sponsored unconsolidated structured entities is provided based on the most appropriate measure of size for the type of entity: (1) The par value of notes issued by securitization conduits and similar liability issuers; (2) the total AUM of investment funds and trusts; and (3) the total fair value of partnership or equity shares in issue for partnerships and similar equity issuers.\n\nthese entities. The/uni00A0Bank earned non-interest income of $2.3 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $2.3 billion) from its involvement with these asset management entities for the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, of which $2.0 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $2.0 billion) was received directly from these entities. The total AUM in these entities as at October/uni00A031, 2022 was $251.7 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $286.8 billion). Any assets transferred by the/uni00A0Bank during the period are commingled with assets obtained from third parties in the market. Except as previously disclosed, the/uni00A0Bank has no contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to unconsolidated structured entities.\n\nfor these risks is discussed in shaded sections of the 'Managing Risk' section of the MD&A.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, only specific or a combination of risk components are hedged, including benchmark interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and equity price components. All these risk components are observable in the relevant market environment and the change in the fair value or the variability in cash flows attributable to these risk components can be reliably measured for hedged items. The/uni00A0Bank also enters into derivative transactions to economically hedge certain exposures that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is not considered feasible.",

        "page_content": "Where the derivatives are in hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging instruments and hedged items:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in fixed rates, when contractual coupons of the fixed rate hedged items are designated;\n- \u00b7 Differences in the discounting factors, when hedging derivatives are collateralized;\n- \u00b7 CVA on the hedging derivatives; and\n- \u00b7 Mismatch in critical terms such as tenor and timing of cash flows between hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nTo mitigate a portion of the ineffectiveness, the/uni00A0Bank designates the benchmark risk component of contractual cash flows of hedged items and executes hedging derivatives with high-quality counterparties. The majority of the/uni00A0Bank's hedging derivatives are collateralized.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nInterest rate swaps are OTC contracts in which two counterparties agree to exchange cash flows over a period of time based on rates applied to a specified notional amount. This includes interest rate swaps that are transacted and settled through a clearing house which acts as a central counterparty. A typical interest rate swap would require one counterparty to pay a fixed market interest rate in exchange for a variable market interest rate determined from time to time, with both calculated on a specified notional amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place.\n\nForward rate agreements are OTC contracts that effectively fix a future interest rate for a period of time. A typical forward rate agreement provides that at a pre-determined future date, a cash settlement will be made between the counterparties based upon the difference between a contracted rate and a market rate to be determined in the future, calculated on a specified notional amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place.\n\nInterest rate options are contracts in which one party (the purchaser of an option) acquires from another party (the writer of an option), in exchange for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, either to buy or sell, on a specified future date or series of future dates or within a specified time, a specified financial instrument at a contracted price. The underlying financial instrument will have a market price which varies in response to changes in interest rates. In managing the/uni00A0Bank's interest rate exposure, the/uni00A0Bank acts as both a writer and purchaser of these options. Options are transacted both OTC and through exchanges.\n\nInterest rate futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange, with interest bearing instruments as the underlying reference assets. These contracts differ from forward rate agreements in that they are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted on an exchange.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to benchmark interest rate risk by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of existing and/or forecast assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. These swaps are designated in either fair value hedges against fixed rate assets/liabilities or cash flow hedges against floating rate assets/liabilities. For fair value hedges, the/uni00A0Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the/uni00A0Bank uses a hypothetical derivative having terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item as the proxy for measuring the change in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Derivatives\n\nForeign exchange forwards are OTC contracts in which one counterparty contracts with another to exchange a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of a second currency, at a future date or range of dates.\n\nSwap contracts comprise foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Foreign exchange swaps are transactions in which a foreign currency is simultaneously purchased in the spot market and sold\n\nin the forward market, or vice-versa. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange principal and interest cash flows in different currencies over a period of time. These contracts are used to manage currency and/or interest rate exposures.\n\nForeign exchange futures contracts are similar to foreign exchange forward contracts but differ in that they are in standard currency amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted on an exchange.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank uses non-derivative instruments such as foreign currency deposit liabilities and derivative instruments such as cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These hedging instruments are designated in either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges. For net investment hedges, the/uni00A0Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the translation gains and losses on the net investment in the foreign operation. For cash flow hedges, the/uni00A0Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the change in the cash flows of the foreign currency denominated asset/liability attributable to foreign exchange risk, using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank uses credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps to manage risks in the/uni00A0Bank's corporate loan portfolio and other cash instruments, as well as managing counterparty credit risk on derivatives. Credit risk is the risk of loss if a borrower or counterparty in a transaction fails to meet its agreed payment obligations. The/uni00A0Bank uses credit derivatives to mitigate industry concentration and borrower-specific exposure as part of the/uni00A0Bank's portfolio risk management techniques. The credit, legal, and other risks associated with these transactions are controlled through well established procedures. The/uni00A0Bank's policy is to enter into these transactions with investment grade financial institutions. Credit risk to these counterparties is managed through the same approval, limit, and monitoring processes that is used for all counterparties to which the/uni00A0Bank has credit exposure.\n\nCredit derivatives are OTC contracts designed to transfer the credit risk in an underlying financial instrument (usually termed as a reference asset) from one counterparty to another. The most common credit derivatives are CDS, which include contracts transacted through clearing houses, and total return swaps. In CDS contracts, the CDS purchaser acquires credit protection on a reference asset or group of assets from a writer of CDS in exchange for a premium. The purchaser may pay the agreed premium at inception or over a period of time. The credit protection compensates the purchaser for deterioration in value of the reference asset or group of assets upon the occurrence of certain credit events such as bankruptcy, or changes in specified credit rating or credit index. Settlement may be cash based or physical, requiring the delivery of the reference asset to the CDS writer. In total return swap contracts, one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a reference asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest earned on these assets in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates. These cash settlements are made regardless of whether there is a credit event.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also transacts in equity and commodity derivatives in both exchange and OTC markets.\n\nEquity swaps are OTC contracts in which one counterparty agrees to pay, or receive from the other, cash amounts based on changes in the value of a stock index, a basket of stocks or a single stock. These contracts sometimes include a payment in respect of dividends.\n\nEquity options give the purchaser of the option, for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy from or sell to the writer of an option, an underlying stock index, basket of stocks or a single stock at a contracted price. Options are transacted both OTC and through exchanges.",

        "page_content": "Equity index futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange. They are based on an agreement to pay or receive a cash amount based on the difference between the contracted price level of an underlying stock index and its corresponding market price level at a specified future date. There is no actual delivery of stocks that comprise the underlying index. These contracts are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates.\n\nEquity forwards are OTC contracts in which one counterparty contracts with another to buy or sell a single stock or stock index, or to settle the contract in cash based on changes in the value of a reference asset, at a future date.\n\nCommodity contracts include commodity forwards, futures, swaps, and options, such as precious metals and energy-related products in both OTC and exchange markets.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank applies hedge accounting on certain equity forwards and/ or total return swaps to hedge exposure to equity price risk. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The/uni00A0Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the change in the cash flows of the hedged item attributable to movement in equity price, using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nFair Value of Derivatives\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                      | October 31, 2022 Fair value as at  balance sheet date   | October 31, 2022 Fair value as at  balance sheet date   | October 31, 2021 Fair value as at  balance sheet date   | October 31, 2021 Fair value as at  balance sheet date   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Positive                                                | Negative                                                | Positive                                                | Negative                                                |\n| Derivatives held or issued for trading purposes     |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Interest rate contracts 1                           |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Forward rate agreements                             | $  359                                                  | $  57                                                   | $  37                                                   | $  68                                                   |\n| Swaps                                               | 17,535                                                  | 11,200                                                  | 7,430                                                   | 9,450                                                   |\n| Options written                                     | -

As a result of IBOR reform, these benchmark rates are subject to discontinuance, or may become illiquid after the adoption of ARRs as established benchmark rates. Judgment may be required in determining whether certain hedging relationships that involve hedging changes in fair value or variability of cash flows attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange risk continue to qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nImpacted hedging relationships will continue to be monitored for each significant benchmark rate subject to ARR transition. As the new ARRs are likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates, new or revised hedging strategies may be required to better align derivative hedging instruments\n\nwith hedged items. Given ongoing market developments, the assessment of the impact on the/uni00A0Bank's hedging strategies and its mitigation plans is progressing.\n\nThe following table discloses the notional amount of derivative instruments designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships referencing US LIBOR that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 30, 2023. The table also discloses the notional amount of derivative instruments designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships referencing GBP LIBOR in the comparative fiscal period that were transitioning to an ARR and were maturing after December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021.",

market value at inception. They obtain value, positive or negative, as relevant interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity, commodity or credit prices or indices change, such that the previously contracted terms of the derivative transactions have become more or less favourable than what can be negotiated under current market conditions for contracts with the same terms and the same remaining period to expiry.\n\nThe potential for derivatives to increase or decrease in value as a result of the foregoing factors is generally referred to as market risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk on derivatives, also known as counterparty credit risk, is the risk of a financial loss occurring as a result of the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation to the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nDerivative-related credit risks are subject to the same credit approval, limit and monitoring standards that are used for managing other transactions that create credit exposure. This includes evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties, and managing the size, diversification and maturity structure of the portfolios. The/uni00A0Bank actively engages in risk mitigation strategies through the use of multi-product derivative master netting agreements, collateral and other risk mitigation techniques. Master netting agreements reduce risk to the/uni00A0Bank by allowing the/uni00A0Bank to close out and net transactions with counterparties subject to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. The current replacement cost and credit equivalent amount shown in the following table are based on the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. According to this approach, the current replacement cost accounts for the fair value of the positions, posted and received collateral, and master netting agreement clauses. The credit equivalent amount is the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future exposure, which is calculated by applying factors determined by OSFI to the notional principal amount of the derivatives. The risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the adequate risk weights to the credit equivalent amount.",

Most often, these contingent events are in the form of a downgrade of the senior debt rating of the/uni00A0Bank, either as counterparty or as guarantor of one of the/uni00A0Bank's subsidiaries. At October/uni00A031, 2022, the aggregate net liability position of those contracts would require: (1) the posting of collateral or other acceptable remedy totalling $392/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A0$73/uni00A0million) in the event of a one-notch or two-notch downgrade in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Bank's senior debt rating; and (2) funding totalling nil (October/uni00A031, 2021 - nil) following the termination and settlement of/uni00A0outstanding derivative contracts in the event of a one-notch or two-notch downgrade in the/uni00A0Bank's senior debt rating.\n\nCertain of the/uni00A0Bank's derivative contracts are governed by master derivative agreements having credit support provisions that permit the/uni00A0Bank's counterparties to call for collateral depending on the net mark-to-market exposure position of all derivative contracts governed by that master derivative agreement. Some of these agreements may/uni00A0permit the/uni00A0Bank's counterparties to require, upon the downgrade of the/uni00A0credit rating of the/uni00A0Bank, to post additional collateral. As at October/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, the fair value of all derivative instruments with credit/uni00A0risk related contingent features in a net liability position was/uni00A0$19/uni00A0billion (October/uni00A031,/uni00A02021 - $12 billion). The/uni00A0Bank has posted $18/uni00A0billion (October/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A0- $15 billion) of collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, the impact of a/uni00A0one-notch downgrade in the/uni00A0Bank's credit rating would require the/uni00A0Bank to post an additional $174/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $182/uni00A0million) of/uni00A0collateral to that posted in the normal course of business. A two-notch downgrade in the/uni00A0Bank's credit rating would require the/uni00A0Bank to post an/uni00A0additional $269/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $266/uni00A0million) of collateral to that posted in the normal course of business.\n\nN O T E 1 2\n\n|\n\n## INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES\n\n## INVESTMENT IN THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank has significant influence over The Charles Schwab Corporation ('Schwab') and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy-making decisions of Schwab through a combination of the/uni00A0Bank's ownership, board representation and the insured deposit account agreement between the/uni00A0Bank and Schwab (the 'Schwab IDA Agreement'). As such, the/uni00A0Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The/uni00A0Bank's share of Schwab's earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The/uni00A0Bank takes into account changes in the one-month lag period that would significantly affect the results.\n\nOn August 1, 2022, in order to provide the capital required for the acquisition of Cowen Inc. ('Cowen'), the/uni00A0Bank sold 28.4/uni00A0million non-voting common shares of Schwab at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion). Approximately 15/uni00A0million shares were sold to Schwab pursuant to a repurchase agreement at a price equal to the price obtained in the sale of 13.4/uni00A0million shares sold to a broker dealer pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 . All shares sold automatically converted into shares of Schwab voting common stock and the shares acquired by Schwab are no longer outstanding. The sales reduced the/uni00A0Bank's ownership interest in Schwab from approximately 13.4% to 12.0%. The/uni00A0Bank recognized $997/uni00A0million\n\nas other income (net of $368/uni00A0million loss from AOCI reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.1% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 13.4%), consisting of 9.6% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $24 billion (US$18 billion) (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $26 billion (US$21 billion)) based on the closing price of US$79.67 (October/uni00A031, 2021 - US$82.03) on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the 'Stockholder Agreement') under which the/uni00A0Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab's Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the/uni00A0Bank meeting certain conditions.

The/uni00A0Bank is currently planning to close the transaction in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from certain U.S., Canadian, and foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory approvals are not within the/uni00A0Bank's control. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank from the closing date and reported in the Wholesale Banking segment.\n\n## Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank and First Horizon Corporation ('First Horizon') announced a definitive agreement for the/uni00A0Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all-cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the/uni00A0Bank has invested US$494/uni00A0million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon's common stock). The/uni00A0Bank is currently planning to close the transaction in the first half of fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. Regulatory approvals are not within the/uni00A0Bank's control. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the/uni00A0Bank from the closing date and reported in the U.S. Retail segment.\n\nFirst Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65/uni00A0per share on an annualized basis for the period from November/uni00A027, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed by February 27, 2023 (the 'outside date'), subject to the right of either party (under certain conditions) to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023.\n\nDuring the year, the/uni00A0Bank implemented a strategy to mitigate interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition.\n\n## INVESTMENT IN OTHER ASSOCIATES OR JOINT VENTURES\n\nExcept for Schwab as disclosed above, the/uni00A0Bank did not have investments in associates or joint ventures which were individually material as of October/uni00A031, 2022, or October/uni00A031, 2021. The carrying amount of the/uni00A0Bank's investment in other associates and joint ventures as at October/uni00A031, 2022 was $3.8 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $3.3 billion).\n\nOther associates and joint ventures consisted predominantly of investments in private funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support community-based tax-advantaged investments. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of U.S. federal and state income tax credits, including Low Income Housing Tax Credits, New Markets Tax Credits, and Historic Tax Credits.\n\nThe fair value of First Horizon's fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the/uni00A0Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.\n\nAfter the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments' basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments.\n\nFor the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank reported $1,487/uni00A0million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $154/uni00A0million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank reported $121/uni00A0million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps since the de-designation of the hedge accounting relationships.\n\n## Acquisition of Wells Fargo & Company's Canadian Direct Equipment Finance Business\n\nOn May 1, 2021, the/uni00A0Bank acquired the Canadian Direct Equipment Finance business of Wells Fargo & Company. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated from the acquisition date and included in the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired was allocated to other intangibles and goodwill.",

The results of the acquired business have been consolidated from the acquisition date\n\n## N O T E 1 4 | GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\n\nThe recoverable amount of the/uni00A0Bank's CGUs is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as forecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compared to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the/uni00A0Bank's CGUs are determined by management using risk-based capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). Any capital not directly attributable to the CGUs is held within the Corporate segment. As at the date of the last impairment test, the amount of capital was approximately $21.8 billion and primarily related to treasury assets and excess capital managed within the Corporate segment. The/uni00A0Bank's capital oversight committees provide oversight to the/uni00A0Bank's capital allocation methodologies.\n\n## Key Assumptions\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs has been determined based on its estimated value-in-use.

The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired was allocated to other intangibles and goodwill.\n\nestimated future cash flows based on the/uni00A0Bank's internal forecast are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.\n\nThe following were the key assumptions applied in the goodwill impairment testing:\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe pre-tax discount rates used reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to each group of CGUs and are dependent on the risk profile and capital requirements of each group of CGUs.\n\n## Terminal Value\n\nThe earnings included in the goodwill impairment testing for each operating segment were based on the/uni00A0Bank's internal forecast, which projects expected cash flows over the next five years. Beyond the/uni00A0Bank's internal forecast, cash flows were assumed to grow at a steady terminal growth rate. Terminal growth rates were based on the expected long-term growth of gross domestic product and inflation and ranged from 2.0% to 3.9% (2021 - 2.0% to 3.8%).\n\nIn considering the sensitivity of the key assumptions discussed above, management determined that a reasonable change in any of the above would not result in the recoverable amount of any of the groups of CGUs to be less than their carrying amount.",

The Limited Recourse Trust's assets consist of Class A First Preferred Shares of the/uni00A0Bank, each series which is issued concurrently with the LRCNs (the 'LRCN Preferred Shares'). The LRCN Preferred Shares are eliminated on the/uni00A0Bank's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the event of (i) non-payment of interest following any interest payment date, (ii) non-payment of the redemption price in case of a redemption of the LRCNs, (iii) non-payment of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest at the maturity of the LRCNs, (iv) an event of default on the LRCNs, or (v) a Trigger Event, the recourse of each LRCN holder will be limited to that holder's pro rata share of the Limited Recourse Trust's assets.\n\nThe LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the LRCN Preferred Shares, include standard NVCC provisions necessary for them to qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital under OSFI's CAR guideline. NVCC provisions require the conversion of the instrument into a variable number of\n\ncommon shares upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event. In such an event, each LRCN Preferred Share will automatically and immediately be converted into a variable number of common shares which will be delivered to LRCN holders in satisfaction of the principal amount of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the LRCNs. The number of common shares issued will be determined based on the conversion formula set out in the terms of the respective series of LRCN Preferred Shares.\n\nThe LRCNs are compound instruments with both equity and liability features. Non-payment of interest and principal in cash does not constitute an event of default and will trigger the delivery of the LRCN Preferred Shares. The liability component has a nominal value and, therefore, the proceeds received upon issuance have been presented as equity, and any interest payments are accounted for as distributions on other equity instruments.\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes to the shares and other equity instruments issued and outstanding and treasury instruments held as at and for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Shares and Other Equity Instruments Issued and Outstanding and Treasury Instruments Held\n\n| (millions of shares or other equity instruments and millions of Canadian dollars)    | October 31, 2022   | October 31, 2022   | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                      | Number of shares   | Amount             | Number of shares   | Amount             |\n| Common Shares                                                                        |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Balance as at beginning of year                                                      | 1,823.9            | $ 23,066           | 1,816.1            | $ 22,487           |\n| Proceeds from shares issued on exercise of stock options                             | 1.8                | 120                | 2.8                | 165                |\n| Shares issued as a result of dividend reinvestment plan                              | 17.0               | 1,442              | 5.0                | 414                |\n| Purchase of shares for cancellation and other                                        | (21.0)             | (265)              | -

For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of LRCN Preferred Shares, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate.\n\nFor NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.2 billion in aggregate.\n\n## DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank is prohibited by the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) from declaring dividends on its preferred or common shares if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the/uni00A0Bank is, or the payment would cause the/uni00A0Bank to be, in contravention of the capital adequacy and liquidity regulations of the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) or directions of OSFI. The/uni00A0Bank does not anticipate that this condition will restrict it from paying dividends in the normal course of business. In addition, the ability to pay dividends on common shares without the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares is restricted unless all dividends on the preferred shares have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. Currently, these limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on common shares or preferred shares.\n\nannounced on October 3, 2022, the dividend rate for the Series 16 Shares for the/uni00A05-year period from and including October/uni00A031, 2022 to but excluding October/uni00A031, 2027, if declared, is payable at a per annum rate of 6.301%.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, OSFI issued a news release announcing a series of measures to support the resilience of financial institutions in response to challenges posed by COVID-19. These measures included the expectation that all federally regulated financial institutions halt dividend increases and share buybacks. On November/uni00A04, 2021, OSFI lifted the temporary expectation that financial institutions refrain from increasing regular dividends or undertaking share repurchases, effective immediately.\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\nOn November/uni00A030, 2022, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of ninety-six cents (96 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the/uni00A0Bank for the quarter ending January 31, 2023, payable on and after January 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 6, 2023.\n\n## DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the/uni00A0Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the/uni00A0Bank's discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. The/uni00A0Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the/uni00A0Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares.",

During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2021, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the/uni00A0Bank issued 5.1/uni00A0million common shares from treasury with no discount.\n\n## NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID\n\nOn January 7, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange and OSFI had approved the/uni00A0Bank's previously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 50/uni00A0million of its common shares.\n\n## N O T E 2 2 | INSURANCE\n\n## INSURANCE REVENUE AND EXPENSES\n\nInsurance revenue and expenses are presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income under insurance revenue and insurance claims and related expenses, respectively, net of impact of reinsurance. This includes\n\nConcurrent with the announcement of the/uni00A0Bank's acquisition of First Horizon on February 28, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's automatic share purchase plan established under its NCIB automatically terminated pursuant to its terms.\n\nDuring the six months ended April 30, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank repurchased 21/uni00A0million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $104.50 per share, for a total amount of $2.2 billion, which represents a $1.9/uni00A0billion premium over the share capital amount.

The decrease of $132/uni00A0million (2021 decrease of $88/uni00A0million) was driven by payments of insurance liabilities in the property and casualty business and by interest rate movements, actuarial assumption changes, and the direct underwriting of a product that was previously underwritten on an assumed basis in the life and health business.\n\n## PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CLAIMS DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe following table shows the estimates of cumulative claims incurred, including IBNR, with subsequent developments during the periods and together with cumulative payments to date. The original reserve estimates are evaluated monthly for redundancy or deficiency. The evaluation is based on actual payments in full or partial settlement of claims and current estimates of claims liabilities for claims still open or claims still unreported.\n\n## Incurred Claims

RISK\n\nA variety of assumptions are made related to the future level of claims, policyholder behaviour, expenses and sales levels when products are designed and priced, as well as when actuarial liabilities are determined. Such assumptions require a significant amount of professional judgment. The insurance claims provision is sensitive to certain assumptions. It has not been possible to quantify the sensitivity of certain assumptions such as legislative changes or uncertainty in the estimation process. Actual experience may differ from the assumptions made by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nFor property and casualty insurance, the main assumption underlying the claims liability estimates is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim, and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Claims\n\nliabilities estimates are based on various quantitative and qualitative factors including the discount rate, the margin for adverse deviation, reinsurance, trends in claims severity and frequency, and other external drivers.\n\nQualitative and other unforeseen factors could negatively impact the/uni00A0Bank's ability to accurately assess the risk of the insurance policies that the/uni00A0Bank underwrites. In addition, there may be significant lags between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported to the/uni00A0Bank and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlements of claims.\n\nThe following table outlines the sensitivity of the/uni00A0Bank's property and casualty insurance claims liabilities to reasonably possible movements in the discount rate, the margin for adverse deviation, and the frequency and severity of claims, with all other assumptions held constant. Movements in the assumptions may be non-linear.",

Exposure to concentrations of insurance risk, by type of risk, is mitigated by ceding these risks through reinsurance contracts, as well as careful selection\n\n## N O T E 2 3 | SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## STOCK OPTION PLAN\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank maintains a stock option program for certain key employees. Options on common shares are granted to eligible employees of the/uni00A0Bank under the plan for terms of ten years and vest over a four-year period. These options provide holders with the right to purchase common shares of the/uni00A0Bank at a fixed price equal to the closing market price of the shares on the TSX on the day prior to the date the options were issued.\n\nand implementation of underwriting strategies, which is in turn largely achieved through diversification by line of business and geographical areas. For automobile insurance, legislation is in place at a provincial level and this creates differences in the benefits provided among the provinces.\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, for the property and casualty insurance business, 68.1% of net written premiums were derived from automobile policies (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 65.8%) followed by residential with 31.6% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 33.8%). The distribution by provinces show that business is mostly concentrated in Ontario with 51.2% of net written premiums (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 49.8%). The Western provinces represented 31.7% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 32.5%), followed by the Atlantic provinces with 10.8% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 10.8%), and Qu\u00e9bec at 6.3% (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 6.9%).\n\nConcentration risk is not a major concern for the life and health insurance business as it does not have a material level of regional specific characteristics like those exhibited in the property and casualty insurance business. Reinsurance is used to limit the liability on a single claim. Concentration risk is further limited by diversification across uncorrelated risks. This limits the impact of a regional pandemic and other concentration risks. To improve understanding of exposure to this risk, a pandemic scenario is tested annually.\n\nUnder this plan, 9.9/uni00A0million common shares have been reserved for future issuance (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 12/uni00A0million). The outstanding options expire on various dates to December 12, 2031. The following table summarizes the/uni00A0Bank's stock option activity and related information, adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2014 stock dividend on a retrospective basis, for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Stock Option Activity\n\n| (millions of shares and Canadian dollars)   | 2022             | 2022                             | 2021             | 2021                             |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                             | Number of shares | Weighted- average exercise price | Number of shares | Weighted- average exercise price |\n| Number outstanding, beginning of year       | 12.2             | $  65.36                         | 13.1             | $  61.27                         |\n| Granted                                     | 2.5              | 95.33                            | 2.2              | 71.88                            |\n| Exercised                                   | (1.8)            | 57.65                            | (2.8)            | 50.67                            |\n| Forfeited/expired                           | (0.1)            | 80.75                            | (0.3)            | 71.50                            |\n| Number outstanding, end of year             | 12.8             | $  72.05                         | 12.2             | $  65.36                         |\n| Exercisable, end of year                    | 4.4              | $  60.16                         | 4.4              | $  54.36                         |",

For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, 2.5/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 2.2/uni00A0million) options were granted by the/uni00A0Bank at a weighted-average fair value of $12.41 per option (2021 - $8.90 per option) estimated using a binomial tree-based valuation option pricing model.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of options for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Assumptions Used for Estimating the Fair Value of Options\n\n| (in Canadian dollars, except as noted)   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Risk-free interest rate                  | 1.47%    | 0.71%    |\n| Option contractual life                  | 10 years | 10 years |\n| Expected volatility 1                    | 17.89%   | 18.50%   |\n| Expected dividend yield                  | 3.66%    | 3.61%    |\n| Exercise price/share price               | $ 95.33  | $ 71.88  |\n\n## OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank operates restricted share unit and performance share unit plans which are offered to certain employees of the/uni00A0Bank. Under these plans, participants are awarded share units equivalent to the/uni00A0Bank's common shares that generally vest over three years. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units. At the maturity date, the participant receives cash representing the value of the share units. The final number of performance share units will typically vary from 80% to 120% of the number of units outstanding at maturity (consisting of initial units awarded plus additional units in lieu of dividends) based on the/uni00A0Bank's total shareholder return relative to the average of a peer group of large Canadian financial institutions. For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank awarded 6.9/uni00A0million of such share units at a weighted-average price of $95.07 (2021 - 7.3/uni00A0million units at a weighted-average price of $72.81). The number of such share units outstanding under these plans as at October/uni00A031, 2022 was 21.6/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 22.4/uni00A0million).\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also offers deferred share unit plans to eligible employees and non-employee directors. Under these plans, a portion of the participant's annual incentive award may be deferred, or in the case of non-employee\n\ndirectors, a portion of their annual compensation may be delivered as share units equivalent to the/uni00A0Bank's common shares. The deferred share units are not redeemable by the participant until termination of employment or directorship. Once these conditions are met, the deferred share units must be redeemed for cash no later than the end of the next calendar year. Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional units. For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank awarded 0.2/uni00A0million deferred share units at a weighted-average price of $94.80 (2021 - 0.2/uni00A0million units at a weighted-average price of $73.41). As at October/uni00A031, 2022, 6.8/uni00A0million deferred share units were outstanding (October/uni00A031, 2021 - 6.5/uni00A0million).\n\nCompensation expense for these plans is recorded in the year the incentive award is earned by the plan participant. Changes in the value of these plans are recorded, net of the effects of related hedges, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank recognized compensation expense, net of the effects of hedges, for these plans of $657/uni00A0million (2021 - $511/uni00A0million). The compensation expense recognized before the effects of hedges was $768/uni00A0million (2021 $1.3 billion). The carrying amount of the liability relating to these plans, based on the closing share price, was $2.3 billion at October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $2.4 billion), and is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP PLAN\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also operates a share purchase plan available to Canadian employees. Employees can contribute up to 10% of their annual eligible earnings (net of source deductions) to the Employee Ownership Plan. For participating employees below the level of Vice President, the/uni00A0Bank matches 100% of the first $250 of employee contributions each year and the remainder of employee contributions at 50% to an overall maximum of 3.5% of the employee's eligible earnings or $2,250, whichever comes first. The/uni00A0Bank's contributions vest once an employee has completed two/uni00A0years of continuous service with the/uni00A0Bank. For the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's contributions totalled $85/uni00A0million (2021/uni00A0-/uni00A0$81/uni00A0million) and were expensed as salaries and employee benefits. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, an aggregate of 23/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A022/uni00A0million) common shares were held under the Employee Ownership Plan. The shares in the Employee Ownership Plan are purchased in the open market and are considered outstanding for computing the/uni00A0Bank's basic and diluted earnings per share. Dividends earned on the/uni00A0Bank's common shares held by the Employee Ownership Plan are used to purchase additional common shares for the Employee Ownership Plan in/uni00A0the open market.",

Pension arrangements include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and supplementary arrangements that provide pension benefits in excess of statutory limits. The/uni00A0Bank also provides certain post-retirement benefits.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's principal defined benefit pension plans, consisting of The Pension Fund Society of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (the 'Society') and the defined benefit portion of the TD Pension Plan (Canada) (the 'TDPP DB'), are for eligible Canadian Bank employees who elected to join the Society or the TDPP DB. The Society was closed to new members on January 30, 2009, and the TDPP DB commenced on March 1, 2009. Effective December 31, 2018, the TDPP DB was closed to new employees hired after that date. All new permanent employees hired in Canada on or after January 1, 2019 are eligible to join the defined contribution portion of the TDPP (the 'TDPP DC') after one year of service. Benefits under the principal defined benefit pension plans are determined based upon the period of plan participation and the average salary of the member in the best consecutive five years in the last ten years of combined plan membership. Benefits under the TDPP DC are funded from the balance of the accumulated contributions of the member and the/uni00A0Bank plus the member's investment earnings. Annual expense for the TDPP DC is equal to the/uni00A0Bank's contributions to the plan.\n\nFunding for the/uni00A0Bank's principal defined benefit pension plans is provided by contributions from the/uni00A0Bank and members of the plans through a separate trust. In accordance with legislation, the/uni00A0Bank contributes amounts, as determined on an actuarial basis, to the plans and has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the liabilities of the plans are adequately funded over time.

The/uni00A0Bank's funding policy is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by legislation. Any contributions in excess of the minimum requirements are discretionary. The principal defined benefit pension plans are registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency and are subject to the acts and regulations that govern federally regulated pension plans. The 2022 and 2021 contributions were made in accordance with the actuarial valuation reports for funding purposes as at October/uni00A031,/uni00A02021 and October/uni00A031, 2020, respectively. Valuations for funding purposes are being prepared as of October/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nPost-retirement defined benefit plans are unfunded and, where offered, generally include health care and dental benefits or, to assist with the cost, a benefits subsidy to be used to reduce the cost of coverage. Employees must meet certain age and service requirements to be eligible for postretirement benefits and are generally required to pay a portion of the cost of the benefits. Effective June 1, 2017, the/uni00A0Bank's principal post-retirement defined benefit plan, covering eligible Canadian employees, was closed to new employees hired on or after that date.\n\n## (a) INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plans are expected to each achieve a rate of return that meets or exceeds the change in value of the plan's respective liabilities over rolling five-year periods. The investments are managed with the primary objective of providing reasonable rates of return, consistent with available market opportunities, economic conditions, consideration of plan liabilities, prudent portfolio management, and the target risk profiles for the plans.\n\nThe asset allocations by asset category for the principal defined benefit pension plans are as follows:",

Foreign equities are included to further diversify the portfolio. A maximum of 10% of the equity portfolio can be invested in emerging market equities.\n\nDerivatives can be utilized by the principal defined benefit pension plans provided they are not used to create financial leverage, unless the financial leverage is for risk management purposes. The principal defined benefit pension plans are permitted to invest in alternative investments, such as private equity, infrastructure equity, and real estate.\n\n## (b) RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's principal defined benefit pension plans are overseen by a single retirement governance structure established by the Human Resources Committee of the/uni00A0Bank's Board of Directors. The governance structure utilizes retirement governance committees who have responsibility to oversee plan operations and investments, acting in a fiduciary capacity. Strategic, material plan changes require the approval of the/uni00A0Bank's Board of Directors.\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plans' investments include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks. These risks include market risk (including foreign currency, interest rate, inflation, equity price, and credit spread risks), credit risk, and liquidity risk. Key material risks faced by defined benefit plans are a decline in interest rates or credit spreads, which could increase the present value of the projected benefit obligation by more than the change in the value of plan assets, and from longevity risk (that is, lower mortality rates).\n\nAsset-liability matching strategies are employed to focus on obtaining an appropriate balance between earning an adequate return and having changes in liability values hedged by changes in asset values.\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plans manage these financial risks in accordance with the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 , applicable regulations, as well as the plans' written investment policies. Specific risk management practices monitored for the principal defined benefit pension plans include performance, credit exposure, and asset mix.\n\n## (c) OTHER SIGNIFICANT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\n## Canada Trust (CT) Pension Plan\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of CT Financial Services Inc., the/uni00A0Bank sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, which is closed to new members, but for which active members continue to accrue benefits. Funding for the plan is provided by contributions from the/uni00A0Bank and members of the plan.\n\n## TD Bank, N.A. Retirement Plans\n\nTD Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries maintain a defined contribution 401(k) plan covering all employees. Annual expense is equal to the/uni00A0Bank's contributions to the plan.\n\nTD Bank, N.A. also has frozen defined benefit pension plans covering certain legacy TD Banknorth and TD Auto Finance (legacy Chrysler Financial) employees. TD Bank, N.A. also has closed post-retirement benefit plans, which include limited medical coverage and life insurance benefits, covering certain groups of employees from legacy organizations.\n\n## Government Pension Plans\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also makes contributions to government pension plans, including the Canada Pension Plan, Quebec Pension Plan and Social Security under the U.S. Federal Insurance Contribution Act .\n\n## (d) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN EXPENSE\n\nThe following table summarizes expenses for the/uni00A0Bank's defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plan Expenses\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)       | For the years ended October 31   | For the years ended October 31   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                      | 2022                             | 2021                             |\n| Defined contribution pension plans 1 | $ 195                            | $ 178                            |\n| Government pension plans 2           | 412                              | 355                              |\n| Total                                | $ 607                            | $ 533                            |\n\n## (e) DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe following table presents the financial position of the/uni00A0Bank's principal pension and post-retirement defined benefit plans and the/uni00A0Bank's other material defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.

These include discount rate, rates of compensation increase, life expectancy, and health\n\ncare cost initial trend rates, as applicable. The sensitivity analysis provided in the table should be used with caution, as it is hypothetical and the impact of changes in each significant assumption may not be linear. For each sensitivity test, the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown with other assumptions left unchanged. Actual experience may result in simultaneous changes in a number of key assumptions, which could magnify or diminish certain sensitivities.\n\n## Sensitivity of Significant Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted)                   | As at October 31, 2022   | As at October 31, 2022                 | As at October 31, 2022                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Principal pension plans  | Principal post-retirement benefit plan | Other pension   and post-retirement benefit plans |\n| Impact of an absolute change in significant actuarial assumptions |                          |                                        |                                                   |\n| Discount rate                                                     |                          |                                        |                                                   |\n| 1% decrease in assumption                                         | $  996                   | $  47                                  | $  225                                            |\n| 1% increase in assumption                                         | (790)                    | (38)                                   | (190)                                             |\n| Rates of compensation increase                                    |                          |                                        |                                                   |\n| 1% decrease in assumption                                         | (199)                    | - 1                                    | - 1                                               |\n| 1% increase in assumption                                         | 183                      | - 1                                    | - 1                                               |\n| Life expectancy                                                   |                          |                                        |                                                   |\n| 1 year decrease in assumption                                     | (117)                    | (9)                                    | (63)                                              |\n| 1 year increase in assumption                                     | 114                      | 9                                      | 62                                                |\n| Health care cost initial trend rate                               |                          |                                        |                                                   |\n| 1% decrease in assumption                                         | n/a                      | (6)                                    | - 1                                               |\n| 1% increase in assumption                                         | n/a                      | 7                                      | - 1                                               |",

As at October/uni00A031, 2022, the CRA has reassessed the/uni00A0Bank for $1,646/uni00A0million of income tax and interest for the years 2011 to 2017, the RQA has reassessed the/uni00A0Bank for $34/uni00A0million for the years 2011 to 2015, and the ATRA has reassessed the/uni00A0Bank for $54/uni00A0million for the years 2011 to 2016. In total, the/uni00A0Bank has been reassessed for $1,734/uni00A0million of income tax\n\nand interest. The/uni00A0Bank expects to continue to be reassessed for open years. The/uni00A0Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and intends to challenge all reassessments.\n\n## Proposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget\n\nThe Canadian Federal budget presented on April 7, 2022, proposed to introduce a one-time tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to as the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD), and an additional permanent tax. On November/uni00A022, 2022, the legislation to implement the CRD and the additional permanent tax completed second reading in the House of Commons.",

        "page_content": "The legislation proposes the CRD to be a 15% tax on an average of 2020 and 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. The additional permanent tax is proposed to be 1.5% of taxable income above $100/uni00A0million. It would be prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, and will result in revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. These taxes, if enacted as proposed,\n\nwill result in higher amounts of taxes payable in each of the impacted years.

The/uni00A0Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the/uni00A0Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The/uni00A0Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank's RPL is from zero to approximately $1.26 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - from zero to approximately\n\n$1.45 billion). The/uni00A0Bank's provisions and RPL represent the/uni00A0Bank's best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the/uni00A0Bank's provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the/uni00A0Bank's estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the/uni00A0Bank's control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages.",

        "page_content": "In management's opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the/uni00A0Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the/uni00A0Bank's consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period.\n\nStanford Litigation -The/uni00A0Bank was named as a defendant in Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. , a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas related to a US$7.2 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by R. Allen Stanford, the owner of Stanford International Bank, Limited (SIBL), an offshore bank based in Antigua. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of investors in SIBL issued certificates of deposit. The/uni00A0Bank provided certain correspondent banking services to SIBL. Plaintiffs allege that the/uni00A0Bank and four other banks aided and abetted or conspired with Mr. Stanford to commit fraud and that the/uni00A0bank defendants received fraudulent transfers from SIBL by collecting fees for providing certain services.\n\nThe Official Stanford Investors Committee (OSIC), a court-approved committee representing investors, received permission to intervene in the lawsuit and has brought similar claims against all the/uni00A0bank defendants.\n\nThe court denied in part and granted in part the/uni00A0Bank's motion to dismiss the lawsuit on April 21, 2015. The court also entered a class certification scheduling order requiring the parties to conduct discovery and submit briefing regarding class certification. The class certification motion was fully submitted on October 26, 2015. The class plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting certain additional state law claims against the/uni00A0Bank on June 23, 2015. The/uni00A0Bank's motion to dismiss the newly amended complaint in its entirety was fully submitted on August/uni00A018,/uni00A02015. On April 22, 2016, the/uni00A0Bank filed a motion to reconsider the court's April 2015 dismissal decision with respect to certain claims by OSIC under the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act based on an intervening change in the law announced by the Texas Supreme Court on April 1, 2016. On July 28, 2016, the court issued a decision denying defendants' motions to dismiss the class plaintiffs' complaint and to reconsider with respect to OSIC's complaint. The/uni00A0Bank filed its answer to the class plaintiffs' complaint on August 26, 2016. OSIC filed an amended intervenor complaint against the/uni00A0Bank on November/uni00A04, 2016 and the/uni00A0Bank filed its answer to this amended complaint on December 19, 2016.\n\nOn November/uni00A07, 2017, the Court issued a decision denying the class certification motion. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to show that common issues of fact would predominate given the varying sales presentations they allegedly received.\n\nOn November/uni00A021, 2017, the class plaintiffs filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking permission to appeal the District Court's denial of class certification to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The/uni00A0Bank filed an opposition to the class plaintiffs' petition on December/uni00A04, 2017. The Fifth Circuit denied the class plaintiffs' petition on April 20, 2018.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the/uni00A0Bank, along with the other bank defendants, filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in OSIC's case seeking dismissal of three claims (aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting conversion, and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). The motion was fully briefed as of April 4, 2019. On September 10, 2019, OSIC filed a motion for leave to amend its intervenor complaints against the/uni00A0Bank and the other bank defendants to insert additional factual allegations. The motion was fully briefed as of October 15, 2019. On June 15, 2020, the Northern District of Texas (N.D. Tex.) court granted OSIC's motion for leave to amend its intervenor complaints against the/uni00A0Bank and the other bank defendants, and OSIC's Second Amended Intervenor Complaint against the/uni00A0Bank and certain other bank defendants was filed on that same date. On July 10, 2020, the N.D. Tex. court so-ordered the parties' agreed motion extending the/uni00A0Bank's time to respond to the Second Amended Intervenor Complaint until July 31, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the/uni00A0Bank filed its answer to the Second Amended Intervenor Complaint. On July 7,/uni00A02020, the/uni00A0Bank, along with the other defendants, requested to withdraw the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the court issued an order finding the motion moot on August 14, 2020.\n\nOn May 3, 2019, two groups of plaintiffs comprising more than 950/uni00A0investors in certificates of deposit issued by SIBL, and those who purchased one or more of such investors' claims, filed motions to intervene in OSIC's case against the/uni00A0Bank and the other bank defendants. On September 18, 2019, the Court denied the motions to intervene. On October 14, 2019, one group of plaintiffs (comprising 147 investors) filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and briefing was complete on the appeal as of April 8, 2020. On October 7, 2020, the Fifth Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal. On February 3, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Court's denial of intervention. On February 17, 2021, the/uni00A0Bank and the other bank appellees filed a petition for rehearing of the Fifth Circuit's decision regarding OSIC's standing to pursue the intervenors' claims. On March 12, 2021, the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing, but clarified its prior holding regarding OSIC's standing to pursue the intervenors' claims.\n\nOn November/uni00A01, 2019, a second group of plaintiffs (comprising 1,286/uni00A0investors) filed a petition in Texas state court against the/uni00A0Bank and other bank defendants, captioned Smith v. Independent Bank, et/uni00A0al. , alleging claims similar to those alleged in the Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action. On November/uni00A026, 2019, the U.S. Receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate filed a motion to enjoin the Texas state court action in the United States District Court for the N.D. Tex. On January 15, 2020, the Court granted the U.S. Receiver's motion to enjoin the Texas state court action. On February 26, 2020, another defendant bank removed the Texas state court action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (S.D. Tex.). On April 13, 2020, the removing bank defendant and plaintiffs requested that the S.D. Tex. court stay the action for an initial period of 120 days. On April 20, 2020, the S.D. Tex. court stayed all case deadlines until August 14, 2020. On July/uni00A014,/uni00A02020, the removing bank defendant and plaintiffs requested that the S.D. Tex. court extend the stay of the action for an additional period of 90 days. On July 19,/uni00A02020, the S.D. Tex. court extended the stay until November/uni00A014,/uni00A02020. On October 30,/uni00A02020, the removing bank defendant and plaintiffs requested that the S.D. Tex. court extend the stay of the action for an additional period of 60 days. On November/uni00A030, 2020, the S.D. Tex. court stayed and administratively closed Smith v. Independent Bank, et al. , subject to reinstatement on the parties' motion. On January/uni00A029, 2021, the removing bank defendant and plaintiffs requested that the S.D. Tex. Court extend the current stay and administrative closure for an additional period of 60/uni00A0days. On February 1, 2021, the S.D. Tex. court granted the request. On April/uni00A02,/uni00A02021, the S.D. Tex. court granted a further stay until July 31,/uni00A02021, and the case remains administratively closed. A joint status report was filed in the Smith action on January/uni00A031,/uni00A02022. In the report, the removing bank defendant requested a status conference to address how to resolve the overlapping issues with the Rotstain litigation. Plaintiffs requested that the Smith matter should continue to be stayed. On August 8, 2022, the Court issued an order keeping the Smith action administratively closed and directing the parties to continue to file biannual reports.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the/uni00A0Bank and the other bank defendants filed motions for summary judgment in Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. , and briefing was complete on the motions as of April 9, 2021.\n\nOn March 19, 2021, plaintiffs in Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. filed a notice abandoning four of the seven claims asserted against the/uni00A0Bank: (i) aiding, abetting, or participation in fraudulent transfers; (ii) aiding, abetting or participation in a fraudulent scheme; (iii) aiding, abetting or participation in conversion; and (iv) civil conspiracy. On March/uni00A025, 2021, the N.D. Tex. court struck the May 6, 2021 ready-for-trial date to allow the trial court to set appropriate deadlines after remand.\n\nOn August 9, 2021, the/uni00A0Bank filed a motion for leave to file a second motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the remaining claims asserted by OSIC are precluded by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice's June 8, 2021 judgment. The motion was fully briefed as of September/uni00A013, 2021.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the/uni00A0Bank's motion for summary judgment. Also on January 20, 2022, the Rotstain Court issued a Suggestion of Remand that recommended to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) that the Rotstain matter be remanded for further proceedings to the Southern",

        "page_content": "District of Texas. That day, the JPML issued a Conditional Remand Order, which took effect on January 27, 2022. On March 10, 2022, the Rotstain matter was transferred to the Southern District of Texas.\n\nOn April 29, 2022, the/uni00A0bank defendants, including the/uni00A0Bank, moved to dismiss certain of plaintiffs' claims for lack of jurisdiction and lack of standing. Briefing on the/uni00A0bank defendants' motion to dismiss was completed on May 27, 2022.\n\nOn May 23, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank also filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that all of the claims asserted by the OSIC are precluded by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice's June 8, 2021 judgment. On June 13, 2022, OSIC filed an opposition to the/uni00A0Bank's summary judgment motion and cross-moved for summary judgment on the/uni00A0Bank's affirmative defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Briefing on the motions was completed on July 12, 2022.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, the Court entered an order setting the Rotstain matter for trial beginning on February 27, 2023.\n\nOn October 3, 2022, the Court entered orders denying the/uni00A0bank defendants', including the/uni00A0Bank's, motions to exclude the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses. On October 20-21, 2022, the Court entered orders granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' motions to exclude the testimony of certain of the/uni00A0bank defendants' expert witnesses.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank was also a defendant in two cases filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice: (1) McDonald v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank , an action filed by the Joint Liquidators of SIBL appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, and (2) Dynasty Furniture Manufacturing Ltd., et al. v. The Toronto Dominion Bank , an action filed by five investors in certificates of deposits sold by Stanford. The suits asserted that the/uni00A0Bank acted negligently and provided knowing assistance to SIBL's fraud. The trial of both actions took place from January 11, 2021 to April 29, 2021. On June/uni00A08, 2021, the Superior Court rendered judgment dismissing both actions. On July 8, 2021, the Joint Liquidators filed an appeal of their action in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. There is no appeal in the Dynasty Furniture action. The hearing of the appeal in the Joint Liquidators' action took place on April 20-21, 2022. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has taken the matter under reserve and will issue a written decision in due course.\n\nTD Ameritrade Stockholder Litigation -On May 12, 2020, a stockholder of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ('Ameritrade') filed a class action complaint captioned Hawkes v. Bettino, et al. , CA No. 2020-0360-PAF, in the Delaware Court of Chancery challenging the transaction between Ameritrade and The Charles Schwab Corporation ('Schwab'). Among other claims, the initial complaint alleged that the merger was subject to Delaware's interested stockholder statute but violated that statute because it had not been conditioned on approval of 66 2/3% of Ameritrade's shares, excluding those held by the/uni00A0Bank and Schwab. On June 4, 2020, a sufficient percentage of Ameritrade's shares were voted to approve the transaction and the plaintiff thereafter dismissed that claim. On February/uni00A05, 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming as defendants the/uni00A0Bank, certain TD Bank-affiliated entities, the five former Ameritrade directors designated by the/uni00A0Bank, certain other former officers and directors of Ameritrade, and Schwab. The amended complaint alleges that the/uni00A0Bank was a controlling stockholder of Ameritrade and breached its fiduciary duties by negotiating an amended Insured Deposit Account Agreement with Schwab that improperly diverted merger consideration from Ameritrade's other stockholders. The amended complaint further asserts breach of fiduciary duty claims against the/uni00A0Bank-designated directors and the other individual defendants based on the same allegations. Finally, the amended complaint alleges that Schwab aided and abetted the breaches by the other defendants. On April 29, 2021, all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The motion to dismiss hearing occurred on November/uni00A018, 2021.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, the parties (i.e., plaintiff and all defendants) informed the Court that they had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the action subject to the parties' ability to satisfy certain conditions and their submission of a stipulation memorializing the settlement within 45 days. On March 25, 2022, the parties (i.e., plaintiff and all defendants) filed their stipulation and agreement of settlement,\n\ncompromise and release. The Court held a settlement hearing on September 21, 2022. The Court approved the settlement and all claims were dismissed with prejudice.\n\nCredit Card Fees -Between 2011 and 2013, seven proposed class actions were commenced, five of which remain in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec: Coburn and Watson's Metropolitan Home v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. ; Macaronies Hair Club v. BOFA Canada Bank, et al. ; Hello Baby Equipment Inc. v. BOFA Canada Bank, et al. ; Bancroft-Snell, et al. v. Visa Canada Corporation, et al. ; and 9085-4886 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Visa Canada Corporation, et al.\n\nThe plaintiff class members are Canadian merchants who accept payment for products and services by Visa Canada Corporation (Visa) and/or MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard) (collectively, the 'Networks'). While there is some variance, in most of the actions it is alleged that, from March 2001 to the present, the Networks conspired with their issuing banks and acquirers to fix excessive fees and that certain rules have the effect of increasing the merchant fees.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank, together with the remaining bank defendants, have collectively entered into a national settlement with the class. They will collectively pay a total of $120/uni00A0million in exchange for the dismissal of the Credit Card Actions and other related litigation.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, after a joint settlement approval hearing on December 6, 2021, the national settlement was approved by the five courts in which the actions were filed.\n\nRothstein Litigation -During the second quarter of 2022, the/uni00A0Bank reached a settlement in TD Bank, N.A. v. Lloyd's Underwriters et al. , in Canada, pursuant to which the/uni00A0Bank recovered losses resulting from the previous resolution by the/uni00A0Bank of multiple proceedings in the U.S. related to an alleged Ponzi scheme perpetrated by, among others, Scott Rothstein. The $224/uni00A0million amount was recovered in the second quarter of 2022 and was recorded in Other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nConsumer Class Actions -The/uni00A0Bank, along with several other Canadian financial institutions, is a defendant in a number of matters brought by consumers alleging provincial claims in connection with various fees, interest rate calculations, and credit decisions. The cases are in various stages of maturity.\n\n## (c) COMMITMENTS\n\n## Credit-related Arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the/uni00A0Bank enters into various commitments and contingent liability contracts. The primary purpose of these contracts is to make funds available for the financing needs of customers. The/uni00A0Bank's policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these contracts and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans made by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\nFinancial and performance standby letters of credit represent irrevocable assurances that the/uni00A0Bank will make payments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties and they carry the same credit risk, recourse, and collateral security requirements as loans extended to/uni00A0customers. Performance standby letters of credit are considered nonfinancial guarantees as payment does not depend on the occurrence of a/uni00A0credit event and is generally related to a non-financial trigger event.\n\nDocumentary and commercial letters of credit are instruments issued on behalf of a customer authorizing a third party to draw drafts on the/uni00A0Bank up to a certain amount subject to specific terms and conditions. The/uni00A0Bank is at risk for any drafts drawn that are not ultimately settled by the customer, and the amounts are collateralized by the assets to which they relate.\n\nCommitments to extend credit represent unutilized portions of authorizations to extend credit in the form of loans and customers' liability under acceptances. A discussion on the types of liquidity facilities the/uni00A0Bank provides to its securitization conduits is included in Note/uni00A010.\n\nThe values of credit instruments reported as follows represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the/uni00A0Bank could be obligated to extend should contracts be fully utilized.",

These representations and warranties attest that the/uni00A0Bank, as the seller, has executed the sale of assets in good faith, and in compliance with relevant laws and contractual requirements. In the event that they do not meet these criteria, the loans may be required to be repurchased by the/uni00A0Bank.\n\n## (e) GUARANTEES\n\nIn addition to financial and performance standby letters of credit, the following types of transactions represent the principal guarantees that the/uni00A0Bank has entered into.\n\n## Credit Enhancements\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank guarantees payments to counterparties in the event that thirdparty credit enhancements supporting asset pools are insufficient.\n\n## Indemnification Agreements\n\nIn the normal course of operations, the/uni00A0Bank provides indemnification agreements to various counterparties in transactions such as service agreements, leasing transactions, and agreements relating to acquisitions and dispositions. Under these agreements, the/uni00A0Bank is required to compensate counterparties for costs incurred as a result of various contingencies such as changes in laws and regulations and litigation claims. The nature of certain indemnification agreements prevent the/uni00A0Bank from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that the/uni00A0Bank would be required to pay such counterparties.\n\n## N O T E 2 8 | RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to directly or indirectly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions. The/uni00A0Bank's related parties include key management personnel, their close family members and their related entities, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, and postemployment benefit plans for the/uni00A0Bank's employees.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank also indemnifies directors, officers, and other persons, to the extent permitted by law, against certain claims that may be made against them as a result of their services to the/uni00A0Bank or, at the/uni00A0Bank's request, to another entity.\n\n## (f) PLEDGED ASSETS AND COLLATERAL\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, securities and other assets are pledged against liabilities or contingent liabilities, including repurchase agreements, securitization liabilities, covered bonds, obligations related to securities sold short, and securities borrowing transactions. Assets are also deposited for the purposes of participation in clearing and payment systems and depositories or to have access to the facilities of central banks in foreign jurisdictions, or as security for contract settlements with derivative exchanges or other derivative counterparties.\n\nDetails of assets pledged against liabilities and collateral assets held or repledged are shown in the following table:\n\n## Sources and Uses of Pledged Assets and Collateral\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                      | As at           | As at           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                     | October 31 2022 | October 31 2021 |\n| Sources of pledged assets and collateral                            |                 |                 |\n| Bank assets                                                         |                 |                 |\n| Cash and due from banks                                             | $  -            | $  223          |\n| Interest-bearing deposits with banks                                | 8,916           | 6,580           |\n| Loans                                                               | 95,961          | 81,468          |\n| Securities                                                          | 107,739         | 98,200          |\n| Other assets                                                        | 1,032           | 475             |\n|                                                                     | 213,648         | 186,946         |\n| Third-party assets 1                                                |                 |                 |\n| Collateral received and available for   sale or repledging          | 396,998         | 354,873         |\n| Less: Collateral not repledged                                      | (122,079)       | (85,248)        |\n|                                                                     | 274,919         | 269,625         |\n|                                                                     | 488,567         | 456,571         |\n| Uses of pledged assets and collateral 2                             |                 |                 |\n| Derivatives                                                         | 19,815          | 14,864          |\n| Obligations related to securities sold under  repurchase agreements | 154,772         | 170,314         |\n| Securities borrowing and lending                                    | 129,721         | 119,915         |\n| Obligations related to securities sold short                        | 41,556          | 34,424          |\n| Securitization                                                      | 28,278          | 29,030          |\n| Covered bond                                                        | 36,425          | 26,924          |\n| Clearing systems, payment systems,   and depositories               | 11,201          | 9,261           |\n| Foreign governments and central banks                               | 934             | 1,010           |\n| Other                                                               | 65,865          | 50,829          |\n| Total                                                               | $ 488,567       | $ 456,571       |\n\n## TRANSACTIONS WITH KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, THEIR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS, AND THEIR RELATED ENTITIES\n\nKey management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of the/uni00A0Bank, directly or indirectly.

As at October/uni00A031, 2022, deposits under the Schwab IDA Agreement were $174/uni00A0billion (US$128/uni00A0billion) (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $176 billion (US$142/uni00A0billion)). Starting July/uni00A01, 2021, deposits can be reduced at Schwab's option by up to US$10 billion in a year (subject to certain adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. The/uni00A0Bank paid fees of $1.7/uni00A0billion during the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 $1.6 billion) to Schwab related to sweep deposit accounts. The amount paid by the/uni00A0Bank is based on the average insured deposit balance of $182/uni00A0billion for the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022 (October/uni00A031, 2021 $186 billion) and yields based on agreed upon market benchmarks, less the actual interest paid to clients of Schwab.\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, amounts receivable from Schwab were $31/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $26/uni00A0million). As at October/uni00A031, 2022, amounts payable to Schwab were $152/uni00A0million (October/uni00A031, 2021 $195/uni00A0million).\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank and other financial institutions provided Schwab and its/uni00A0subsidiaries with unsecured revolving loan facilities. As at October/uni00A031, 2022, there was no loan commitment provided by the/uni00A0Bank to Schwab (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $95/uni00A0million undrawn).\n\n## ii)  TRANSACTIONS WITH SYMCOR\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank has one-third ownership in Symcor, a Canadian provider of business process outsourcing services offering a diverse portfolio of integrated solutions in item processing, statement processing and production, and cash management services. The/uni00A0Bank accounts for Symcor's results using the equity method of accounting.

The Corporate segment includes the effects of certain asset securitization programs, treasury management, elimination of taxable equivalent adjustments and other management reclassifications, corporate level tax items, and residual unallocated revenue and expenses.\n\nThe results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses,\n\nand assets generated by the businesses in that segment. Due to the complexity of the/uni00A0Bank, its management reporting model uses various estimates, assumptions, allocations, and risk-based methodologies for funds transfer pricing, inter-segment revenue, income tax rates, capital, indirect expenses and cost transfers to measure business segment results. The basis of allocation and methodologies are reviewed periodically to align with management's evaluation of the/uni00A0Bank's business segments. Transfer pricing of funds is generally applied at market rates. Intersegment revenue is negotiated between each business segment and approximates the fair value of the services provided. Income tax provision or recovery is generally applied to each segment based on a statutory tax rate and may be adjusted for items and activities unique to each segment. Amortization of intangibles acquired as a result of business combinations is included in the Corporate segment. Accordingly, net income for business segments is presented before amortization of these intangibles.",

        "page_content": "Non-interest income is earned by the/uni00A0Bank primarily through investment and securities services, credit fees, trading income, service charges, card services, and insurance revenues. Revenues from investment and securities services are earned predominantly in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Revenues from credit fees are primarily earned in the Wholesale Banking and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segments. Trading income is earned within Wholesale Banking. Both service charges and card services revenue are mainly earned in the U.S. Retail and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segments. Insurance revenue is earned in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment.\n\n## Results by Business Segment 1\n\nNet interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or taxexempt income, primarily dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the/uni00A0Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB adjustment reflected in Wholesale Banking is reversed in the Corporate segment.\n\nThe following table summarizes the segment results for the years ended October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                        | For the years ended October 31           | For the years ended October 31   | For the years ended October 31   | For the years ended October 31   | For the years ended October 31   | For the years ended October 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                                       |                                          |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  | 2022                             |\n|                                                                                       | Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking | U.S. Retail                      | Wealth Management and Insurance  | Wholesale Banking 2              | Corporate 2                      | Total                            |\n| Net interest income (loss)                                                            | $ 12,396                                 | $  9,604                         | $  945                           | $  2,937                         | $  1,471                         | $ 27,353                         |\n| Non-interest income (loss)                                                            | 4,190                                    | 2,821                            | 9,915                            | 1,894                            | 2,859                            | 21,679                           |\n| Total revenue                                                                         | 16,586                                   | 12,425                           | 10,860                           | 4,831                            | 4,330                            | 49,032                           |\n| Provision for (recovery of) credit losses                                             | 491                                      | 335                              | 1                                | 37                               | 203                              | 1,067                            |\n| Insurance claims and related expenses                                                 | -

        "page_content": "|\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, trading market, and operational risks. The/uni00A0Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives.\n\nThe/uni00A0Bank's capital management objectives are:\n\n- \u00b7 To be an appropriately capitalized financial institution as determined by:\n- - the/uni00A0Bank's Risk Appetite Statement;\n- - capital requirements defined by relevant regulatory authorities; and\n- - the/uni00A0Bank's internal assessment of capital requirements, including stress test analysis, consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's risk profile and risk tolerance levels.\n- \u00b7 To have the most economic weighted-average cost of capital achievable, while preserving the appropriate mix of capital elements to meet targeted capitalization levels.\n- \u00b7 To ensure ready access to sources of appropriate capital, at reasonable cost, in order to:\n- - insulate the/uni00A0Bank from unexpected loss events; and\n- - support and facilitate business growth and/or acquisitions consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's strategy and risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 To support strong external debt ratings, in order to manage the/uni00A0Bank's overall cost of funds and to maintain access to required funding.\n\nThese objectives are applied in a manner consistent with the/uni00A0Bank's overall objective of providing a satisfactory return on shareholders' equity.\n\n## Basel III Capital Framework\n\nCapital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier/uni00A01, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III also implemented a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the build-up of excess leverage in the/uni00A0banking sector. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier/uni00A01 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n## Capital Position and Capital Ratios\n\nThe Basel framework allows qualifying banks to determine capital levels consistent with the way they measure, manage, and mitigate risks. It specifies methodologies for the measurement of credit, trading market, and operational risks. The/uni00A0Bank uses the AIRB approach to credit risk for all material portfolios.\n\nFor accounting purposes, IFRS is followed for consolidation of subsidiaries and joint ventures. For regulatory capital purposes, all subsidiaries of the/uni00A0Bank are consolidated except for insurance subsidiaries\n\nwhich are deconsolidated and follow prescribed treatment per OSFI's CAR guidelines. Insurance subsidiaries are subject to their own capital adequacy reporting, such as OSFI's Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test. Some of the/uni00A0Bank's subsidiaries are individually regulated by either OSFI or other regulators. Many of these entities have minimum capital requirements which may limit the/uni00A0Bank's ability to extract capital or funds for other uses.\n\nOn November/uni00A022, 2019, the/uni00A0Bank was designated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). During the year ended October/uni00A031, 2022, the/uni00A0Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Effective January 1, 2016, OSFI's target CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8%, 9.5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to previously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of the public Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current published buffer is set at 2.5% of total RWA and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising OSFI's published CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital minimum target ratios to 10.5%, 12.0%, and 14.0%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%.\n\nOn September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the/uni00A0Bank was required to meet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November/uni00A01, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio.\n\nThe following table summarizes the/uni00A0Bank's regulatory capital position as at October/uni00A031, 2022 and October/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Position\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars,   except as noted)               | As at           | As at           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                 | October 31 2022 | October 31 2021 |\n| Capital                                                         |                 |                 |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital                                    | $ 83,671        | $ 69,937        |\n| Tier 1 Capital                                                  | 94,445          | 75,716          |\n| Total Capital                                                   | 107,175         | 87,987          |\n| Risk-weighted assets used in the calculation  of capital ratios | 517,048         | 460,270         |\n| Capital and leverage ratios                                     |                 |                 |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio                              | 16.2%           | 15.2%           |\n| Tier 1 Capital ratio                                            | 18.3            | 16.5            |\n| Total Capital ratio                                             | 20.7            | 19.1            |\n| Leverage ratio                                                  | 4.9             | 4.8             |\n| TLAC Ratio                                                      | 35.2            | 28.3            |\n| TLAC Leverage Ratio                                             | 9.4             | 8.2             |",

These customary requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Local regulatory capital and/or surplus adequacy requirements;\n- \u00b7 Basel requirements under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2;\n- \u00b7 Local regulatory approval requirements; and\n- \u00b7 Local corporate and/or securities laws.\n- 3 Carrying amounts are prepared for purposes of meeting the disclosure requirements of Section 308 (3)(a)(ii) of the/uni00A0 Bank Act (Canada) . Intercompany transactions may be included herein which are eliminated for consolidated financial reporting purposes.\n\nAs at October/uni00A031, 2022, the net assets of subsidiaries subject to regulatory or CAR was approximately $82 billion (October/uni00A031, 2021 - $91 billion), before intercompany eliminations.\n\nIn addition to regulatory requirements outlined above, the/uni00A0Bank may be subject to significant restrictions on its ability to use the assets or settle the liabilities of members of its group. Key contractual restrictions may arise from the provision of collateral to third parties in the normal course of business, for example through secured financing transactions; assets securitized which are not subsequently available for transfer by the/uni00A0Bank; and assets transferred into other consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities. The impact of these restrictions has been disclosed in Notes 9 and 27.",
