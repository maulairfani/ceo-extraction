Our strong performance in this context was made possible by the dedication of our talented team, the relationships we have built with our clients and our constant focus on value creation.\n\nEarly in the year, we saw significant improvements globally from both health and economic perspectives. As the year progressed, inflation accelerated, interest rates rose and geopolitical risks intensified, contributing to persistent volatility and heightened economic uncertainty. We successfully navigated this complex environment, remained focused on the execution of our strategic priorities and delivered strong financial results.\n\nOur consistent performance is supported by our three key pillars. First, our culture encourages us to be agile, entrepreneurial and to work as a team, enabling us to adapt and seize opportunities. Second, our unique strategic positioning with a domestic focus, a leading franchise in Quebec and a targeted strategy outside Canada provides diversification to our earnings streams and resiliency through market cycles. Finally, our disciplined approach towards capital allocation, risk management and cost management is the cornerstone of our robust balance sheet. This solid foundation will continue to support future performance.\n\n## D Diisscciipplliinnee,,  CCoonnssiisstteennccyy,,  PPeerrffoorrmmaannccee\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we generated superior organic growth across all our business segments. Operating leverage, a key performance indicator, was positive for the year.\n\nThe Bank also generated an industry-leading return on equity.  This reflects our ability to strike the right balance between growth, capital deployment discipline and credit quality. It also speaks to the diversification of our activities, which include highly accretive businesses.\n\nIn a context of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, we maintained robust capital levels.\n\nWe ended 2022 with strong capital ratios and prudent levels of allowances for credit losses. We continued to prioritize deploying capital to support organic growth, investing in efficiency improvements and returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIn 2022, we increased our dividend by 26%. This included a 23% increase paid in February 2022, following the lifting of OSFI restrictions on dividend increases and share buybacks set at the beginning of the pandemic. The objective of this substantial increase was to reset the dividend level towards our medium-term payout target range of 40% to 50% of net income. During the year, we also returned $245 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Total shareholder returns over three-, five-, and 10-year periods remained among the best in our peer group, demonstrating our ability to drive consistent returns over time.\n\n## S Sttrroonngg  OOrrggaanniicc  GGrroowwtthh  AAccrroossss  AAllll  BBuussiinneessss S Seeggmmeennttss\n\nIn 2022, our Personal and Commercial Banking business generated solid growth, as we continued to balance volumes, margins and credit quality. We are pleased with our client satisfaction scores, which continued to improve, reflecting our sustained focus on enhancing the end-to-end client experience. We also capitalized on our targeted approach across Canada that is focused on specialized industries. This segment is well-positioned to capture additional market share in Quebec and seize opportunities in other Canadian markets.\n\nOur differentiated Wealth Management segment delivered a strong performance in 2022 despite challenging market conditions. This was supported by a well-diversified revenue mix that includes a strong deposit base, above-market asset growth and enhanced cross-segment opportunities with our other domestic businesses. A key long-term growth lever for the Bank, our Wealth Management business is poised to deliver solid earnings growth and superior return on equity through the cycle.",

Over the years, by investing in people and technology and developing new targeted revenue sources, we have diversified and expanded the earnings power of this segment. The expertise, discipline, strategic focus and sound risk profile of our Financial Markets segment have solidified our leadership in select activities across Canada. This positions the franchise to consistently deliver profitable growth through market cycles.\n\nBeyond Canada, our U.S. Specialty Finance and International segment provides accretive geographic and business diversification. In 2022, Credigy pursued a disciplined investment approach, generating a solid underlying performance. ABA Bank continued to deliver notable growth and is now a leading bank in Cambodia. Our focused international strategy is well-positioned to deliver superior growth and returns over the long term.\n\n## C Coonnttrriibbuuttiinngg  ttoo  aa  SSuussttaaiinnaabbllee  EEccoonnoommyy  ffoorr  AAllll\n\nAs a bank, we play a key role in supporting a just energy transition that considers financial and social imperatives, as well as related dependencies of the Canadian economy. On the environment, our strategy is based on two core principles: managing the impact of our activities on climate change and creating opportunities for our clients to contribute to a sustainable economy with us. This includes progressing in our journey to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operating and financing activities by 2050 and bolstering our support to clients in the transition.\n\nAs we continue to grow our renewable energy loan portfolio at a faster pace than non-renewable, decarbonization criteria and data related to our limits on high-emitting sector activities are now embedded in our lending and underwriting practices. We are also deploying capital to pursue business opportunities in renewable energy and to expand our adapted offering of sustainable products and services across our business lines.\n\nMore broadly, we remain committed to our mission of Putting People First, to generate a positive impact for clients, employees and the communities we have the privilege of serving, while governing ourselves according to the highest standards. From aiming to have over 25% of our workforce comprised of talent from diverse backgrounds, to being the top affordable housing lender in Quebec, we will continue to actively advance our ESG priorities in 2023.\n\n## B Buuiillddiinngg  oonn  OOuurr  SSoolliidd  FFoouunnddaattiioonn\n\nAs we head into 2023, we are confident that our solid foundation will enable us to navigate through economic uncertainty and seize the right opportunities.\n\nTo support our long-term growth, we are committed to continuing to invest in our people and our culture. We will remain focused on deepening our client relationships, with the objective of gaining market share both in our core Quebec market and across Canada.\n\nDigital innovation and automation are key to further enhancing the client experience and operational efficiencies, and we are capitalizing on our momentum in these areas.\n\nWe also see tremendous opportunity for cross-segment synergies, as illustrated by the integration of our commercial and private banking teams in 2022. Working in close collaboration is ingrained in our culture and further enabled by our size and agility. We plan on building on these models across business lines to drive further growth across Canada in the years to come.\n\nWith a strong balance sheet and solid risk management framework, we have the flexibility and resilience to face uncertainty and generate continued profitable growth. Our commitment to creating long-term value for our employees, our clients, our shareholders and our communities remains unwavering.\n\nL Laauurreenntt  FFeerrrreeiirraa President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board is proud of this performance, as it is testament to the Bank's agility, adaptability, and resolute focus on its mission.\n\nIn its deliberations, the Board prioritized its attention on the objectives related to strategic planning, technology, talent, sound and rigorous risk management, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, while reinforcing the organizational foundation that will support the Bank's evolution and ability to create long-term value for all of its stakeholders.\n\n## S Soolliidd  PPeerrffoorrmmaannccee  TThhaannkkss  ttoo  aa  SSoolliidd  TTeeaamm\n\nSupported by the leadership team, Laurent Ferreira took on the new challenges that arose during his first year heading up the Bank. The Board supported him, particularly in the development and implementation of a three-year strategic plan and in the execution of the ongoing multiyear transformation and cultural shift.\n\nIn this context, the Board supported several organizational changes made by the leadership team, including the amalgamation of Information Technology and Operations, the merger of Commercial and Private Banking, and new appointments in Finance and Financial Markets.\n\n## T Thhee  BBaannkk  ooff  tthhee  FFuuttuurree::  TTeecchhnnoollooggyy--BBaasseedd  aanndd P Peeooppllee  FFiirrsstt\n\nThe Bank of the future will continue to put people first while relying on leading-edge technology that will help deliver a unique client experience. The Bank establishes close relationships with clients and has an entrepreneurial culture, and the Board is actively monitoring these competitive advantages for which the Bank is known as well as the impacts of regulatory and technological changes in the sectors where we operate.\n\nThe Bank is continuing its digital transformation, but the work is not complete. Technology, including cybersecurity and data protection, continued to receive much attention from the Board in 2022. The Technology Committee, formerly a subcommittee, became a full committee this year. Its mandate consists of overseeing the various components of the Bank's technology strategy and of monitoring technology risks, particularly those related to cybercrime.\n\n## S Suuppppoorrttiinngg  tthhee  TTrraannssiittiioonn  aanndd  BBuuiillddiinngg  aa  GGrreeeenn E Eccoonnoommyy\n\nThe Bank's commitment to environmental, social and governance matters is a key priority, and the Board remains highly involved with the adoption of ESG principles and with monitoring action plans and targets.\n\nIn this regard, the Bank achieved an important milestone in 2022 by announcing its first interim greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets regarding the intensity of the Canadian oil and gas producer portfolio.\n\nBy continuing to work with clients on the transition and by developing sustainable products and services, we will truly be able to achieve our targets.\n\n## A A  PPoossiittiivvee  IImmppaacctt  oonn  OOuurr  EEmmppllooyyeeeess,,  CClliieennttss  aanndd C Coommmmuunniittiieess\n\nDuring the year, the Board continued to pay particular attention to the Bank's culture, which is paramount to its long-term success.

The EDTF published a report entitled Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks, which contains 32 recommendations. The Bank makes every effort to ensure overall compliance with those recommendations and is continuing to enhance its risk disclosures to meet the best practices on an ongoing basis.

It is based on the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2022 (the consolidated financial statements) and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), unless otherwise indicated. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

All such statements are made in accordance with applicable securities legislation in Canada and the United States. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the economy-particularly the Canadian and U.S. economies-market changes, the Bank's objectives, outlook and priorities for fiscal year 2023 and beyond, the strategies or actions that will be taken to achieve them, expectations for the Bank's financial condition, the regulatory environment in which it operates, the impacts of-and the Bank's response to-the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain risks it faces. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by verbs or words such as 'outlook', 'believe', 'foresee', 'forecast', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'project', 'expect', 'intend' and 'plan', in their future or conditional forms, notably verbs such as 'will', 'may', 'should', 'could' or 'would' as well as similar terms and expressions. Such forward-looking statements are made for the purpose of assisting the holders of the Bank's securities in understanding the Bank's financial position and results of operations as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as the Bank's vision, strategic objectives, and financial performance targets, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and intentions and are subject to uncertainty and inherent risks, many of which are beyond the Bank's control.\n\nAssumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2023 and how that performance will affect the Bank's business are among the main factors considered in setting the Bank's strategic priorities and objectives, including provisions for credit losses. In determining its expectations for economic conditions, both broadly and in the financial services sector in particular, the Bank primarily considers historical economic data provided by the governments of Canada, the United States and certain other countries in which the Bank conducts business, as well as their agencies.\n\nStatements about the economy, market changes, and the Bank's objectives, outlook and priorities for fiscal 2023 and thereafter are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the impacts of which are difficult to predict. These risk factors include, among others, the general economic environment and financial market conditions in Canada, the United States, and other countries where the Bank operates; exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; inflation; disruptions in global supply chains; higher funding costs and greater market volatility; changes made to fiscal, monetary, and other public policies; changes made to regulations that affect the Bank's business; geopolitical and sociopolitical uncertainty; the transition to a low-carbon economy and the Bank's ability to satisfy stakeholder expectations on environmental and social issues; significant changes in consumer behaviour; the housing situation, real estate market, and household indebtedness in Canada; the Bank's ability to achieve its long-term strategies and key short-term priorities; the timely development and launch of new products and services; the Bank's ability to recruit and retain key personnel; technological innovation and heightened competition from established companies and from competitors offering nontraditional services; changes in the performance and creditworthiness of the Bank's clients and counterparties; the Bank's exposure to significant regulatory matters or litigation; changes made to the accounting policies used by the Bank to report financial information, including the uncertainty inherent to assumptions and critical accounting estimates; changes to tax legislation in the countries where the Bank operates, i.e., primarily Canada and the United States; changes made to capital and liquidity guidelines as well as to the presentation and interpretation thereof; changes to the credit ratings assigned to the Bank; potential disruptions to key suppliers of goods and services to the Bank; potential disruptions to the Bank's information technology systems, including evolving cyberattack risk as well as identity theft and theft of personal information; the risk of fraudulent activity; and possible impacts of major events affecting the local and global economies, including international conflicts, natural disasters, and public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of which is difficult to predict and could continue to have repercussions on the Bank.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the Bank's express or implied predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that its assumptions may not be confirmed and that its vision, strategic objectives and financial performance targets will not be achieved. The Bank recommends that readers not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as a number of factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in these forward-looking statements. These risk factors include credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, environmental and social risk, and certain emerging risks or risks deemed significant, all of which are described in greater detail in the Risk Management section beginning on page 65 of the 2022 Annual Report.\n\nThe foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these risk factors is provided in the Risk Management section of the 2022 Annual Report. Investors and others who rely on the Bank's forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Except as required by law, the Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, by it or on its behalf. The Bank cautions investors that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ significantly from these statements due to a number of factors.",

The financial statements also comply with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI), the consolidated financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS, which represent Canadian GAAP. None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS.\n\nThe presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2021. This presentation reflects the fact that the loan portfolio comprising borrowers in the 'Oil and gas' and 'Pipelines' sectors as well as related activities, which had previously been reported in the Personal and Commercial segment, are now reported in the Financial Markets segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its activities with its management structure.\n\nIn addition, a change in accounting policy, as described in the Accounting Policy Changes section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, was applied retrospectively during the year ended October 31, 2022 after the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued a final agenda decision on accounting for the costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's software in a cloud computing arrangement. The figures for the year ended October 31, 2021 have been adjusted to reflect this change in accounting policy.\n\n## N Noonn--GGAAAAPP  aanndd  OOtthheerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess\n\nThe Bank uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Regulation 52-112 respecting Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (Regulation 52-112) prescribes disclosure requirements that apply to the following measures used by the Bank:\n\n- \uf0b7 non-GAAP financial measures;\n- \uf0b7 non-GAAP ratios;\n- \uf0b7 supplementary financial measures;\n- \uf0b7 capital management measures.\n\n## N Noonn--GGAAAAPP  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess\n\nThe Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures that do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and that therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Presenting non-GAAP financial measures helps readers to better understand how management analyzes results, shows the impacts of specified items on the results of the reported periods, and allows readers to better assess results without the specified items if they consider such items not to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Bank's operations. In addition, like many other financial institutions, the Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate net interest income, non-interest income, and income taxes. This calculation method consists of grossing up certain taxexempt income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. An equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform a uniform comparison of the return on different assets regardless of their tax treatment.\n\nThe key non-GAAP financial measures used by the Bank to analyze its results are described below, and a quantitative reconciliation of these measures is presented in the tables in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section on pages 20 and 21 and in the Consolidated Results table on page 27. It should be noted that, for the year ended October 31, 2022, no specified items have been excluded from results, whereas an amount of $9 million in intangible asset impairment losses ($7 million net of income taxes) related to technology developments had been excluded as specified items for the year ended October 31, 2021.\n\n## Adjusted Net Interest Income\n\nThis item represents net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items, if any. A taxable equivalent is added to net interest income so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment, and specified items, if any, are excluded so that net interest income can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Non-Interest Income\n\nThis item represents non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items, if any. A taxable equivalent is added to non-interest income so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment, and specified items, if any, are excluded so that non-interest income can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Total Revenues\n\nThis item represents total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items, if any. It consists of adjusted net interest income and adjusted non-interest income.

They comprise dividends related to financial assets and liabilities associated with trading activities, net of interest expenses and interest income related to the financing of these financial assets and liabilities, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and interest income on securities measured at fair value through profit or loss, income from held-for-trading derivative financial instruments, changes in the fair value of loans at fair value through profit or loss, changes in the fair value of financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, certain commission income, other trading activity revenues, and any applicable transaction costs. A taxable equivalent is added to trading activity revenues so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment.\n\n## N Noonn--GGAAAAPP  RRaattiiooss\n\nThe Bank uses non-GAAP ratios that do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and that may therefore not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A non-GAAP ratio is a ratio in which at least one component is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Bank uses non-GAAP ratios to present aspects of its financial performance or financial position.\n\nThe key non-GAAP ratios used by the Bank are described below.\n\n## Adjusted Return on Common Shareholders' Equity (ROE)\n\nThis item represents ROE excluding specified items, if any. It is adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders expressed as a percentage of average equity attributable to common shareholders. It is a general measure of the Bank's efficiency in using equity. Specified items, if any, are excluded so that ROE can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Dividend Payout Ratio\n\nThis item represents the dividend payout ratio excluding specified items, if any. It is dividends on common shares (per share amount) expressed as a percentage of adjusted basic earnings per share. This ratio is a measure of the proportion of earnings that is paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends. Specified items, if any, are excluded so that the dividend payout ratio can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Operating Leverage\n\nThis item represents operating leverage on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items, if any. It is the difference between the growth rate of adjusted total revenues and the growth rate of adjusted non-interest expenses, and it measures the sensitivity of the Bank's results to changes in its revenues. Adjusted operating leverage is presented on a taxable equivalent basis so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment, and specified items, if any, are excluded so that the efficiency ratio can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Efficiency Ratio\n\nThis item represents the efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items, if any. The ratio represents adjusted non-interest expenses expressed as a percentage of adjusted total revenues. It measures the efficiency of the Bank's operations. The adjusted efficiency ratio is presented on a taxable equivalent basis so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment, and specified items, if any, are excluded so that the efficiency ratio can be better evaluated by excluding items that management believes do not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations.\n\n## Adjusted Net Interest Margin, Non-Trading\n\nThis item represents the non-trading net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis. It is calculated by dividing net interest income related to adjusted nontrading activities by average non-trading interest-bearing assets. This ratio is a measure of the profitability of non-trading activities. The adjusted non-trading net interest margin includes adjusted non-trading net interest income, which includes a taxable equivalent amount so that the performance of the various assets can be compared irrespective of their tax treatment.\n\n## S Suupppplleemmeennttaarryy  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess\n\nA supplementary financial measure is a financial measure that: (a) is not reported in the Bank's consolidated financial statements, and (b) is, or is intended to be, reported periodically to represent historical or expected financial performance, financial position, or cash flows.

During the year ended October 31, 2022, in accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings (Regulation 52-109) released by the CSA, the design and operation of these controls and procedures were evaluated to determine their effectiveness.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the CEO and the CFO confirmed the effectiveness of the DC&P. These controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information disclosed in annual and interim filings and in other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by that legislation. These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Bank's management, including its signing officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThis Annual Report was reviewed by the Bank's Disclosure Committee, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors (the Board), which approved it prior to publication.\n\n## I Inntteerrnnaall  CCoonnttrrooll  OOvveerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg\n\nThe internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which are based on IFRS, unless indicated otherwise as explained on pages 16 to 21 of this MD&A. Due to inherent limitations of internal controls, the ICFR may not prevent or detect all misstatements in a timely manner.\n\nThe CEO and the CFO oversaw the evaluation work performed on the design and operation of the Bank's ICFR in accordance with Regulation 52-109. The ICFR was evaluated in accordance with the control framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO - 2013) for financial controls and in accordance with the control framework of the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) for general information technology controls.\n\nBased on the evaluation results, the CEO and CFO concluded, as at October 31, 2022, that there are no material weaknesses, that the ICFR is effective and provides reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is reliable, and that the Bank's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## C Chhaannggeess  ttoo  IInntteerrnnaall  CCoonnttrrooll  OOvveerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg\n\nOn February 1, 2022, the Bank deployed a new integrated accounting software package, and certain processes that affect ICFR were modified. The Bank has assessed the impact of this deployment and has made sure that the key controls affected and the newly implemented controls are well designed and effective.\n\nThe CEO and CFO also undertook work that enabled them to conclude that, during the year ended October 31, 2022, aside from the above-described change, no changes were made to the ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the design or operation of the ICFR.\n\n## D Diisscclloossuurree  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nThe Bank's Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO by ensuring the design, implementation, and operation of the DC&P and ICFR. In so doing, the committee ensures that the Bank is meeting its disclosure obligations under current regulations and that the CEO and CFO are producing the requisite certifications.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

(Credigy) and Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank) subsidiaries. Other operating activities, certain specified items, Treasury activities, and the operations of the Flinks Technology Inc. (Flinks) subsidiary are grouped in the Other heading of segment results. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele, and marketing strategy. For additional information, see the Business Segment Analysis section of this MD&A.\n\n## O Obbjjeeccttiivveess  aanndd  22002222  RReessuullttss\n\nWhen setting its objectives, the Bank aims for a realistic challenge in the prevailing business environment by considering such factors as changes in banking industry financial results as well as the Bank's business development plan. When the Bank sets its medium-term objectives, it does not take into consideration specified items, if any, which are not reflective of the underlying financial performance of the Bank's operations. Management therefore excludes specified items when assessing the Bank's performance against its objectives.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, the Bank recorded $3,383 million in net income compared to $3,140 million in fiscal 2021, and its diluted earnings per share stood at $9.61 compared to $8.85 in fiscal 2021. The Bank's fiscal 2022 return on common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 18.8% versus 20.7% in fiscal 2021. Its diluted earnings per share stood at $9.61 in fiscal 2022, an 8% increase from adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.87 in fiscal 2021. Furthermore, the 18.8% ROE in fiscal 2022 compares to an adjusted ROE of 20.7% in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe following table compares the Bank's medium-term objectives with its fiscal 2022 results.\n\n|                                             | M Meeddiiuumm--TTeerrmm O Obbjjeeccttiivveess  ((%%))   | 2 2002222  RReessuullttss   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Growth in diluted earnings  \uf02d  Adjusted (1) | 5 5  --  1100                                           | 8 8..33%%                   |\n| ROE  \uf02d  Adjusted (2)                        | 1 155  --  2200                                         | 1 188..88%%                 |\n| Dividend payout ratio  \uf02d  Adjusted (2)      | 4 400  --  5500                                         | 3 366..88%%                 |\n| CET1 capital ratio (3)                      | S Sttrroonngg  lleevveell                               | 1 122..77%%                 |\n| Leverage ratio (3)                          | S Sttrroonngg  lleevveell                               | 4 4..55 %                   |\n\nThe Bank's financial results met all of its medium-term objectives, except for the dividend payout ratio. Year over year, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8%, which is within the target range, and was driven by strong revenue growth in every business segment, growth that more than offset increases in noninterest expenses and in provisions for credit losses. For fiscal 2022, adjusted ROE was in the upper range of the target objective. The CET1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio, at 12.7% and 4.5%, respectively, also met the objectives. As for the adjusted dividend payout ratio, it was below the target distribution range given strong growth in net income and the interruptions to dividend increases prescribed by OSFI between March 13, 2020 and November 4, 2021.\n\nThe Bank also examines its performance using the efficiency ratio and operating leverage. For fiscal 2022, the Bank's efficiency ratio stood at 54.2% compared to 54.9% in fiscal 2021. Its adjusted efficiency ratio for fiscal 2022 was 52.6%, a 1.1 percentage point improvement from 53.7% in fiscal 2021. These improvements are reflective of disciplined cost management by all the Bank's segments.

        "page_content": "## D Diivviiddeennddss\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Bank declared $1,206 million in dividends to common shareholders (2021: $958 million), representing 36.8% of net income attributable to common shareholders (2021: 31.7%).\n\n## Solid Capital Levels (1)\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the Bank's CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratios were, respectively, 12.7%, 15.4% and 16.9%, compared to ratios of, respectively, 12.4%, 15.0% and 15.9% as at October 31, 2021. All of the capital ratios have therefore increased since October 31, 2021, essentially due to net income net of dividends and to common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan. These factors were partly offset by growth in RWA, common share repurchases, and the impact of the transitional measures applicable to ECL provisioning, of which the scaling factor decreased from 50% to 25%. The increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was also due to the $500 million issuance of limited recourse capital notes, i.e., Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) - Series 3, on September 8, 2022. The increase in the Total capital ratio was also due to the $750 million issuance of medium-term notes on July 25, 2022 . As at October 31, 2022, the leverage ratio was 4.5% compared to 4.4% as at October 31, 2021. The growth in Tier 1 capital was partly offset by growth in total exposure, which will continue to benefit, until April 1, 2023, from the temporary measure permitted by OSFI with respect to the exclusion of exposures from central bank reserves.\n\n## H Hiigghh--QQuuaalliittyy  LLooaann  PPoorrttffoolliioo\n\nLoans and acceptances, net of allowances for credit losses, accounted for 51% of the Bank's total assets and amounted to $206.7 billion as at October 31, 2022. For fiscal 2022, the Bank recorded $145 million in provisions for credit losses compared to $2 million in fiscal 2021. This increase was due to higher provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans recorded to reflect a less favourable macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2022 and to a slight deterioration in certain risk parameters, and was also due to an increase in provisions for credit losses on purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) loans, as there had been higher reversals on certain portfolios recorded in fiscal 2021. These increases were tempered by lower provisions for credit losses on impaired loans excluding POCI loans, particularly Commercial Banking loans and Financial Markets loans, partly offset by higher provisions for credit losses on the impaired ABA Bank loans recorded to reflect the end of COVID-19 relief measures that had been granted to clients. Gross impaired loans totalled $1,271 million as at October 31, 2022 compared to $1,126 million as at October 31, 2021 and represented 0.61% of total loans and acceptances.\n\n## R Riisskk  PPrrooffiillee\n\nAs at October 31 or for the year ended October 31\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                                              | 2 2002222   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Provisions for credit losses                                                                                | 1 14455     | 2      |\n| Provisions for credit losses as a % of average loans and acceptances (2)                                    | 0 0..0077   | - %    |\n| Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans excluding POCI loans as a % of average loans and acceptances | 0 0..0077   | 0.11 % |\n| Net write-offs as a % of average loans and acceptances (2)                                                  | 0 0..1100   | 0.09 % |\n| Gross impaired loans as a % of total loans and acceptances (2)                                              | 0 0..6611   | 0.61 % |\n| Gross impaired loans                                                                                        | 1 1,,227711 | 1,126  |\n| Net impaired loans                                                                                          | 1 1,,003300 | 836    |\n\n## A Annnnuuaall  DDiivviiddeenndd  PPeerr C Coommmmoonn  SShhaarree\n\nY Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311 (Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E Evvoolluuttiioonn  ooff  RReegguullaattoorryy R Raattiiooss  UUnnddeerr  BBaasseell  IIIIII (1)\n\nA Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) See the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 16 to 21 for additional information on capital management measures.\n- (2) See the Glossary section on pages 122 to 125 for details on the composition of these measures.\n\n## G Grroossss  IImmppaaiirreedd  LLooaannss\n\nA Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGross impaired loans - Stage 3\n\nGross impaired loans - POCI\n\nGross impaired loans as a % of total loans\n\nand acceptances (bps)\n\n(2)\n\n- Gross impaired loans exlcuding POCI loans as a % of total loans and acceptances (bps) (2)",

While this trend reversal offers promise of greater price stability in the future, the economic impacts will still be significant, especially if the reversal comes at a time when growth has already slowed considerably in several regions. In the eurozone, for example, annualized GDP growth was only 0.7% in the third quarter of 2022, since soaring energy costs are being felt and resulting in a decrease in actual compensation. While the energy situation improved slightly in the third quarter of 2022, several signs are pointing to a recession starting in the fourth quarter of 2022. Elsewhere in the world, emerging markets continue to feel the brunt of a strong U.S. dollar, which is putting upward pressure on inflation and making it more difficult to repay loans in U.S. dollars. All the while, China has continued to feel the economic impacts of its zero-COVID policy at a time when weak consumer demand and sluggish real estate markets can no longer be offset by higher exports. Against this backdrop, the global economy is expected to grow by only 2.2% (1) in 2023, on the heels of 3.1% (1) growth in 2022.\n\nThe last time that the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised interest rates, bringing the target range between 3.75 and 4.00%, Jerome Powell, Chair of the Fed, stated that data published since the last Fed meeting justified having a higher terminal rate than what had previously been presented. And yet, there are increasing signs that an economic slowdown lies ahead. While GDP figures for the third quarter of 2022 showed that growth is rebounding, this is mainly due to international trade since private domestic demand is weakening. More specifically, residential investment decreased for a sixth consecutive quartersomething not seen since the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Inflation continues to hover at abnormally high levels, although there are now many signs pointing to a turnaround, especially given the manufacturing sector slowdown, high inventory levels, a sharp decline in shipping costs, lower selling prices by Chinese producers, and a strong U.S. dollar. Where services are concerned, it may take longer to return inflation to a reasonable level, although there is evidence suggesting far fewer new hires in an environment characterized by anemic growth, which will help to reduce wage pressures. Given this context, the central bank should be able to end its monetary tightening cycle no later than for the first monetary policy meeting in 2023. Otherwise, a recession is practically unavoidable in 2023. Moreover, even if the Fed changes direction, this would not prevent a major slowdown in growth next year. We anticipate a difficult first half next year and growth of only 0.2% (1) for 2023.\n\n## C Caannaaddiiaann  EEccoonnoommyy\n\nIn Canada, efforts to soft-land the economy after a period of overheating are continuing. So far, indicators are moving in the right direction for the Bank of Canada, which suggests that we are approaching the terminal rate in this extremely aggressive tightening cycle. In fact, the labour market is showing signs of moderation: private-sector and full-time jobs have been at a standstill for several months, and hiring intentions are declining, suggesting that there will be no rebound in the short term. Inflationary pressures are less acute and widespread than earlier this year. Nevertheless, given the rushed response and the transmission lag for monetary policy, it is normal for observers to be nervous. Unfortunately, we will only know in hindsight if the response was too aggressive. One thing is certain: we are already seeing a notable slowdown in the real estate market, which is leading to extremely rapid real estate deflation. In our view, it will not be necessary to keep interest rates at current levels for long to cool down inflation; consequently, we expect that the central bank will have to lower them in the second half of next year. In light of this monetary tightening, we anticipate an anemic growth rate of 0.7% (1) in 2023, as consumers will be hit simultaneously by a loss of purchasing power, a negative wealth effect, and interest payment shock.\n\n## Q Quueebbeecc  EEccoonnoommyy\n\nQuebec's economy, which had experienced a spectacular post-pandemic recovery compared to the country as a whole, lost its lead in July 2022 after posting the fourth monthly decline in a row. But that is not overly concerning for now, since this decline has not had a significant adverse effect on the labour market, which is still one of the most stable in the country. The unemployment rate reached 4.1% in October 2022, which is the lowest in all of the provinces, while the job vacancy rate is among the highest in the country. We also see some encouraging structural factors for the Quebec economy, such as a highly diversified economy, fiscal support from the Quebec government, and low electricity costs. Moreover, Quebec households are in a better financial situation (lower financial leverage and higher savings rate), mainly because housing accessibility is significantly better than in the rest of the country. They are therefore less vulnerable to the recent interest rate increase. Our forecast for growth in 2023 is 0.7% (1) , in line with Canada as a whole, despite less favourable demographic factors.\n\n- (1) GDP growth forecasts, National Bank Financial's Economics and Strategy group\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Excellent performance in all of the business segments, driven by revenue growth, contributed to this increase in net income, which was partly offset by higher provisions for credit losses recorded in part to reflect a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in fiscal 2022. Income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes totalled $4,422 million for fiscal 2022, a 10% year-over-year increase that was due to the revenue growth in all of the business segments.\n\n## T Toottaall  RReevveennuueess\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Bank's total revenues amounted to $9,652 million versus $8,927 million in fiscal 2021, a $725 million or 8% increase that was driven by the revenue growth across all of the Bank's business segments. For additional information on total revenues, see Table 2 on page 114. The fiscal 2022 adjusted total revenues grew $818 million or 9% year over year.\n\n## Net Interest Income\n\nFor fiscal 2022, net interest income totalled $5,271 million, up $488 million or 10% from $4,783 million in fiscal 2021 (see Table 3, page 114). As for the adjusted net interest income in fiscal 2022, it amounted to $5,505 million, up 11% from $4,964 million in fiscal 2021.\n\nIn the Personal and Commercial segment, net interest income totalled $2,865 million in fiscal 2022, a $318 million or 12% year-over-year increase owing mainly to growth in loans and deposits, which rose 11% and 7%, respectively, year over year. The loan growth came mainly from mortgage credit and business lending. The increase in net interest income was also due to a higher net interest margin, which rose to 2.14% in 2022 from 2.11% in 2021 as a result of interest rate hikes, and that was primarily attributable to the deposit margin. In the Wealth Management segment, net interest income totalled $594 million in fiscal 2022, a 33% year-over-year increase owing to higher interest rates, growth in loan and deposit volumes, and the deposit margin.\n\nIn the Financial Markets segment, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was down $4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, mainly due to trading activities, and should be examined together with the other items of trading activity revenues. In the USSF&I segment, net interest income rose $183 million or 20% year over year owing to loan and deposit growth at the ABA Bank subsidiary in fiscal 2022 as well as to an increase in the Credigy subsidiary's net interest income given growth in loan portfolios and solid performance in certain portfolios.\n\n## Non-Interest Income\n\nThe Bank's non-interest income amounted to $4,381 million in fiscal 2022, up $237 million or 6% from $4,144 million in fiscal 2021. For additional information on non-interest income, see Table 4 on page 115.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, revenues from underwriting and advisory fees were down 22% year over year, notably due to capital markets activities in the Financial Markets segment. Revenues from securities brokerage commissions were down 14% year over year, essentially due to a decrease in commission-generating transactions in the Wealth Management segment. Combined, mutual fund revenues and revenues from investment management and trust service fees totalled $1,584 million, a $121 million year-over-year increase owing to growth in average assets under administration and under management as a result of net inflows into various solutions and of stock market performance in the first half of 2022.\n\nCredit fee revenues and revenues from acceptances and letters of credit and guarantee were down $16 million year over year, as greater business activity at Commercial Banking was more than offset by a decrease in the activities of Financial Markets. Conversely, card revenues and revenues from deposits and payment service charges rose 26% and 9%, respectively, as an upswing in economic activity led to greater transaction volume during fiscal 2022.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Non-interest income related to trading activity on a taxable equivalent basis totalled $596 million, up from $290 million in fiscal 2021 (Table 5, page 115). Including the portion recorded in net interest income, trading activity revenues on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to $1,507 million in fiscal 2022, a $269 million year-over-year increase that was essentially driven by equity securities revenues from the Financial Markets segment. Conversely, trading activity revenues on a taxable equivalent basis from the Bank's other business segments decreased year over year.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, gains on non-trading securities were down $38 million year over year, in part due to Treasury activities, while insurance revenues were up $27 million year over year, reflecting a revision to actuarial reserves. Also up year over year were foreign exchange revenues and the share in the net income of associates and joint ventures, which rose $9 million and $5 million, respectively. Other revenues amounted to $242 million in fiscal 2022, an $83 million decrease that was notably due to a gain realized on the disposal of certain loan portfolios and to a more favourable impact of the fair value remeasurements of certain Credigy loan portfolios in fiscal 2021. In addition, in fiscal 2021, the Other revenues item had included a $33 million gain on the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Flinks and a $30 million loss related to the fair value measurement of the Bank's equity interest in AfrAsia Bank Limited (AfrAsia).\n\n## NNoonn--IInntteerreesstt  EExxppeennsseess\n\nFor fiscal 2022, non-interest expenses stood at $5,230 million, up $327 million or 7% from fiscal 2021 (Table 6, page 116). In fiscal 2021, non-interest expenses had included $9 million in intangible asset impairment losses. The fiscal 2022 non-interest expenses, compared to $4,894 million in adjusted noninterest expenses, were up $336 million or 7%.\n\nCompensation and employee benefits totalled $3,284 million in fiscal 2022, an 8% year-over-year increase that was notably due to wage growth and a greater number of employees as well as to the variable compensation associated with revenue growth. An increase in technology expenses, including amortization, was attributable to significant investments made to support the Bank's technological evolution and the business development plan. In addition, fiscal 2022 travel and business development expenses increased year over year as activities with clients resumed. These higher expenses were tempered by decreases in certain expenses; in particular, there was a $20 million reversal of the provision for the compensatory tax on salaries paid in Quebec during the first quarter of 2022 as well as a decrease in COVID-19 response expenses, which had been higher during fiscal 2021. Furthermore, a portion of the overall increase in noninterest expenses was attributable to the Flinks acquisition at the end of fiscal 2021.\n\n## P Prroovviissiioonnss  ffoorr  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Bank recorded $145 million in provisions for credit losses compared to $2 million in fiscal 2021 (Table 7, page 117). This increase was mainly attributable to $1 million in provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans during fiscal 2022 compared to the $155 million in reversals of allowances for credit losses recorded during fiscal 2021. The macroeconomic outlook deteriorated in the second half of fiscal 2022, notably due to high inflationary pressure, geopolitical instability, and global supply chain disruptions, whereas in fiscal 2021, the macroeconomic outlook had been more favourable. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans excluding POCI (1) loans were down $45 million in fiscal 2022, mainly those in Commercial Banking and Financial Markets, which decreased $13 million and $77 million, respectively. These decreases were partly offset by a $10 million increase in Personal Banking's provisions for credit losses (including credit card receivables) and a $35 million increase in USSF&I's provisions for credit losses (excluding POCI loans), essentially attributable to the ABA Bank subsidiary, where COVID-19 relief measures that had been granted to customers ended. The provisions for credit losses on Credigy's POCI loans also increased, rising $32 million given the favourable remeasurements of certain portfolios during fiscal 2021. At $138 million for fiscal 2022, the provisions for credit losses on impaired loans excluding POCI loans (1) decreased and represented 0.07% of average loans and acceptances, down from 0.11% in fiscal 2021.\n\n## I Innccoommee  TTaaxxeess\n\nDetailed information about the Bank's income taxes is provided in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal 2022, income taxes stood at $894 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21%, which compares to income taxes of $882 million and a 22% effective tax rate in fiscal 2021. The change in effective tax rates stems mainly from a higher level of tax-exempt dividend income during fiscal 2022.\n\n- (1) See the Glossary section on pages 122 to 125 for details on the composition of these measures.",

Interest rate hikes brought real estate activity to an abrupt halt,\n\nafter it had reached record levels since the start of the pandemic and was characterized by soaring house prices. With house hunters now having less buying power, prices across Canada are undergoing a correction, generating more of an impact on household wealth already falling as a result of weak financial market performance. However, many people seized opportunities that arose during the pandemic to get their financial house in order. In fact, some consumers have amassed excess savings that can be used to cushion the blow of the rising cost of living and higher interest rates. Personal and corporate bankruptcies are on the rise, even though they remain below pre-pandemic levels. The labour market is showing signs of moderation, with full-time private-sector employment stagnating in recent months and hiring intentions slowing down-which does not point to a turnaround in the short-term. Corporate investment remains strong for now, but activity may slow down due to higher funding costs and the uncertain economic outlook.\n\nThe economic environment in 2022 and the outlook for 2023 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.",

The segment's income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes totalled $1,885 million in fiscal 2022, up 17% year over year. The growth in total revenues was driven by a $318 million increase in net interest income and a $101 million increase in non-interest income.

In addition, the successive interest rate increases that occurred in fiscal 2022 had a favourable impact on net interest margin, which rose to 2.14% from 2.11% in fiscal 2021, an increase attributable mainly to the deposit margin.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Personal and Commercial segment's non-interest expenses stood at $2,149 million, a 7% year-over-year increase that was mainly due to higher compensation and employee benefits (given wage growth and a greater number of employees), to greater investments made as part of the segment's technological evolution, and to higher operations support charges. Furthermore, travel and business development costs increased as activities with clients resumed. At 53.3%, the segment's 2022 efficiency ratio improved by 2.2 percentage points from 55.5% in 2021.\n\nThe segment recorded $97 million in provisions for credit losses in fiscal 2022, which is $57 million more than the $40 million recorded in fiscal 2021. This increase came mainly from higher provisions for credit losses on non-impaired Personal Banking loans (including credit card receivables) recorded to reflect less favourable macroeconomic conditions, whereas, in fiscal 2021, a more favourable macroeconomic environment had led to significant reversals of allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans. These increases were tempered by lower provisions for credit losses on impaired Commercial Banking loans as well as by a decrease in provisions for credit losses on non-impaired Commercial Banking loans resulting from more favourable risk parameters in fiscal 2022.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall  BBaannkkiinngg\n\nPersonal Banking's total revenues amounted to $2,359 million in fiscal 2022, a 6% increase from $2,234 million in fiscal 2021. Its net interest income increased, as there was 8% growth in loan volumes, 4% growth in deposit volumes and a higher deposit margin, partly offset by a lower net interest margin on loans. Non-interest income was also up, rising $53 million year over year, essentially due to higher credit card revenues given a notable increase in purchasing volume, higher insurance revenues (reflecting a revision to actuarial reserves), and higher internal commission revenues related to the distribution of Wealth Management products. For fiscal 2022, Personal Banking's non-interest expenses rose $105 million year over year, mainly due to higher compensation and employee benefits (given wage growth and a greater number of employees), to greater investments made as part of the segment's technological evolution, and to higher operations support charges.\n\n## C Coommmmeerrcciiaall  BBaannkkiinngg\n\nCommercial Banking's total revenues amounted to $1,675 million in fiscal 2022, rising 21% from $1,381 million in fiscal 2021. Net interest income was up, essentially due to 17% growth in loans and 11% growth in deposits as well as to a higher net interest margin as interest rates were raised successively during fiscal 2022. Non-interest income was also up, rising $48 million compared to fiscal 2021, mainly due to increases in revenues from bankers' acceptances, in revenues from derivative financial instruments, and in revenues from foreign exchange activities. For fiscal 2022, Commercial Banking's non-interest expenses rose $36 million year over year, mainly due to higher compensation and employee benefits (given wage growth and a greater number of employees), to higher operations support charges, and to higher travel and business development costs as activities with clients resumed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The financial market corrections were brutal, and rising interest rates caused bond and stock portfolios to post losses. A number of stock markets, including the S&P 500, entered bear market territory (market decline of over 20%). Canada's stock market also declined, although it was more resilient, primarily owing to the country's raw materials sectors, which are doing quite well in the current geopolitical context. While the market impacts of rising interest rates were felt very quicky, it will take some time to assess the full economic impacts, which could create volatility in the months to come. Although the North American economy is holding up well, the outlook for 2023 is less rosy. The real estate sector has been hit very hard-both in the U.S. and Canada-and house prices have already begun to slide despite a resilient labour market. Business leaders' confidence has been shaken by the growing risk of recession, and anemic economic growth is expected in 2023.\n\nThe economic environment in 2022 and the outlook for 2023 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.\n\n## O Obbjjeeccttiivveess  aanndd  SSttrraatteeggiicc  PPrriioorriittiieess\n\nThe Wealth Management segment will capitalize on the strength of the Bank's brand by generating sustained earnings growth, further improving client satisfaction, and maintaining high employee engagement.\n\n## 2022 Achievements and Highlights\n\n## 2023 Priorities\n\n| Create highly engaged clients  thanks to an exceptional  advisory-based experience   | \uf03e\uf03e \uf03e\uf03e   | intersegment synergies and by looking beyond  Quebec and also towards sectors with strong  potential.

The segment's income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes totalled $1,446 million in fiscal 2022, up $134 million or 10% from fiscal 2021. Its fiscal 2022 total revenues amounted to $2,468 million, up $250 million or 11% year over year. Global markets revenues rose 28% year over year owing to growth across every revenue category, notably revenues from equities as market conditions favoured greater client activity. As for the fiscal 2022 corporate and investment banking revenues, they were down 8% year over year, mainly due to a decrease in revenues related to capital markets activity, tempered by revenues generated by favourable merger and acquisition activity and by growth in loan volumes.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the segment's non-interest expenses rose 13% year over year, essentially attributable to higher compensation and employee benefits, notably the variable compensation associated with revenue growth, and to higher technology investment expenses and operations support charges. The segment's 2022 efficiency ratio was 41.4% versus 40.8% in 2021.\n\nFinancial Markets recorded $23 million in recoveries of credit losses during fiscal 2022 compared to $24 million in recoveries of credit losses in fiscal 2021. A $78 million increase in provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans, resulting from a less favourable macroeconomic outlook than in fiscal 2021, was offset by a $77 million decrease in provisions for credit losses on impaired loans.\n\n## T Toottaall  RReevveennuueess  bbyy  CCaatteeggoorryy\n\nY Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal markets\n\n-\n\nEquities\n\n- Global markets -Fixed income Global markets -Commodities and foreign exchange\n- Corporate and investment banking",

The segment's total revenues amounted to $1,110 million in fiscal 2022 versus $1,001 million in fiscal 2021, an 11% increase resulting from a $159 million or 31% increase in the ABA Bank subsidiary's revenues driven by loan and deposit growth, partly offset by a $47 million decrease in the Credigy subsidiary's revenues.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the segment's non-interest expenses stood at $344 million compared to $315 million in fiscal 2021, a $29 million increase attributable to higher non-interest expenses at ABA Bank resulting from its business growth.\n\nThe segment's provisions for credit losses increased by $81 million compared to fiscal 2021, resulting in part from the more favourable macroeconomic outlook in fiscal 2021 as well as from more favourable remeasurements of Credigy's POCI loan portfolios in fiscal 2021.\n\n## C Crreeddiiggyy\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Credigy subsidiary's net income totalled $216 million, a 28% year-over-year decrease that was notably due to lower revenue and a significant increase in provisions for credit losses. Its income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes totalled $308 million in fiscal 2022, down 11% year over year. Credigy's fiscal 2022 total revenues amounted to $439 million, down from $486 million in fiscal 2021. While there was growth in net interest income, it was more than offset by a decrease in non-interest income, that was due to a $26 million gain that had been realized in the first quarter of 2021 upon a disposal of loan portfolios, to a favourable impact of fair value remeasurements of certain portfolios during fiscal 2021, and to an unfavourable impact upon remeasurements of certain portfolios in fiscal 2022. Credigy's non-interest expenses were down $8 million year over year, mainly due to a decrease in variable compensation. Provisions for credit losses rose $76 million year over year, whereas in fiscal 2021, reversals of allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans had been recorded to reflect more favourable macroeconomic conditions at that time and more favourable remeasurements of POCI loan portfolios had also been carried out.\n\n## A ABBAA  BBaannkk\n\nFor fiscal 2022, ABA Bank's net income totalled $340 million, up 35% from fiscal 2021. Growth in the subsidiary's business activities, mainly in the form of sustained loan and deposit growth, drove total revenues up 31% year over year. This increase was, however, partly offset by lower interest rates on loans given a competitive environment in Cambodia. The subsidiary's fiscal 2022 non-interest expenses stood at $212 million, a 23% year-over-year increase resulting from higher compensation and employee benefits (notably due to higher salaries given a greater number of employees and higher variable compensation associated with revenue growth) and from higher occupancy expenses attributable to business growth. ABA Bank recorded $31 million in provisions for credit losses in fiscal 2022, which is $5 million more than last year, as provisions for credit losses on impaired loans increased to reflect the end of COVID-19 relief measures that had been granted to the subsidiary's clients.\n\nA Avveerraaggee  LLooaannss  aanndd  RReecceeiivvaabblleess  --  CCrreeddiiggyy Y Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPOCI loans\n\n## A Avveerraaggee  LLooaannss  aanndd  AAvveerraaggee  DDeeppoossiittss  --  AABBAA  BBaannkk\n\nY Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLoans\n\nDeposits\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This change in net loss was due to a decrease in total revenues arising mainly from a lower contribution from Treasury activities and from lower gains on investments in fiscal 2022. This decrease in revenues was tempered by a reduction in non-interest expenses, notably variable compensation, and in pension plan expense as well as by a $20 million reversal of the provision for the compensatory tax on salaries paid in Quebec. In fiscal 2021, the net loss had included a $33 million gain on a remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Flinks and a $30 million loss ($26 million net of income taxes) related to the fair value measurement of the Bank's equity interest in AfrAsia.\n\nThe specified items, net of income taxes, recorded in fiscal 2021 had consisted of $7 million in intangible asset impairment losses. For fiscal 2022, net loss stood at $289 million compared to a $183 million adjusted net loss in fiscal 2021.",

In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, the Bank's net income results decreased year over year; this was due to higher provisions for credit losses, as more favourable macroeconomic conditions in these quarters of 2021 had led to reversals of allowances for credit losses. Conversely, for the first two quarters of fiscal 2022, the net income results increased year over year. These increases came from the net income growth generated in each business segment, notably due to higher revenues, and from lower provisions for credit losses recorded in these quarters of fiscal 2022.\n\nNet interest income posted year-over-year increases in every quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were driven by loan and deposit growth in both the Personal and Commercial segment and the Wealth Management segment, by trading activity revenues in the Financial Markets segment (except for the fourth quarter), by loan portfolio growth and the good performance of certain Credigy portfolios, and by an increase in ABA Bank's net interest income owing to sustained business growth. In addition, interest rates were increased successively during fiscal 2022, which had a favourable impact on net interest income in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022.\n\nNon-interest income posted year-over-year increases in every quarter of fiscal 2022 except for the third quarter; the increases were driven partly by sustained business growth in the Personal and Commercial segment, particularly in the area of card revenues, where there was a notable increase in purchasing volume. In the Wealth Management segment, non-interest income grew substantially in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022 given growth in average assets under administration and under management as a result of net inflows into various solutions and also due to stock market performance. Conversely, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, non-interest income was down year over year, notably because higher gains on non-trading securities had been realized during the third quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, non-interest income was favourably affected by trading activity revenues in the Financial Markets segment. Some factors, however, had an unfavourable impact on non-interest income, including the more favourable fair value remeasurements of Credigy loan portfolios during the quarters of 2021 and a gain realized in the first quarter of 2021 upon a disposal of certain Credigy loan portfolios.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, non-interest expenses posted year-over-year increases in every quarter. These increases came from compensation and employee benefits, notably due to wage growth and a greater number of employees, as well as from investments made as part of the Bank's technological evolution. Travel and business development expenses were also up in every quarter of fiscal 2022, as activities with clients resumed during the year. However, certain expenses decreased, in particular the compensatory tax on salaries for which a downward adjustment was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 as well as the expenses incurred to implement client and employee health and safety measures in response to COVID-19, which had been higher during fiscal 2021.\n\nFor the first two quarters of fiscal 2022, provisions for credit losses decreased year over year; these decreases were due to reversals of allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans recorded in the first half of fiscal 2022 given improvements in both the macroeconomic outlook and credit conditions, as well as to lower provisions for credit losses on impaired Commercial Banking and Financial Markets loans. Conversely, in the last two quarters of fiscal 2022, the provisions for credit losses increased year over year given less favourable macroeconomic conditions and a slight deterioration in credit conditions during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the year-over-year increase in the provisions for credit losses was also due to the favourable remeasurements of Credigy's POCI loan portfolios that had been recorded in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nThe change in the effective tax rates between the quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 came essentially from a higher level and proportion of tax-exempt dividend income in every quarter of fiscal 2022, except for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

At $95.6 billion as at October 31, 2022, residential mortgages (including home equity lines of credit) have posted strong growth since 2018 and accounted for 46% of total loans and acceptances. The growth in residential mortgages was driven by sustained demand for mortgage credit in the Personal and Commercial segment and by the business activity at Financial Markets, ABA Bank, and Credigy. As for personal loans (including credit card receivables), they totalled $18.7 billion as at October 31, 2022, rising $2.2 billion since October 31, 2021. With respect to commercial loans, the key increases were recorded in the agriculture, utilities, manufacturing, financial services, real estate and real-estate-construction, and other services categories. As at October 31, 2022, certain categories were down compared to a year ago, notably the oil and gas category as well as the education and health care category. Furthermore, the Credigy subsidiary's POCI loans remained relatively stable since October 31, 2021.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                           | 2 2002222       | 2021 (1)   | % %  cchhaannggee   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|\n| A Asssseettss                                                                            |                 |            |                     |\n| Cash and deposits with financial institutions                                            | 3 311,,887700   | 33,879     | ( (66))             |\n| Securities                                                                               | 1 10099,,771199 | 106,304    | 3 3                 |\n| Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed         | 2 266,,448866   | 7,516      | 2 25522             |\n| Loans and acceptances, net of allowances                                                 | 2 20066,,774444 | 182,689    | 1 133               |\n| Other                                                                                    | 2 288,,992211   | 25,233     | 1155                |\n|                                                                                          | 4 40033,,774400 | 355,621    | 1 144               |\n| L Liiaabbiilliittiieess  aanndd  eeqquuiittyy                                            |                 |            |                     |\n| Deposits                                                                                 | 2 26666,,339944 | 240,938    | 1 111               |\n| Other                                                                                    | 1 11144,,110011 | 95,233     | 2200                |\n| Subordinated debt                                                                        | 1 1,,449999     | 768        | 9 955               |\n| Equity attributable to the Bank ' s shareholders and holders of other equity instruments | 2 211,,774444   | 18,679     | 1166                |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                | 2 2             | 3          | ( (3333))           |\n|                                                                                          | 4 40033,,774400 | 355,621    | 1 144               |\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the Bank had total assets of $403.7 billion, which rose $48.1 billion or 14% from $355.6 billion since the end of fiscal 2021.\n\n## C Caasshh  aanndd  DDeeppoossiittss  WWiitthh  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttiittuuttiioonnss\n\nAt $31.9 billion as at October 31, 2022, cash and deposits with financial institutions were down $2.0 billion since October 31, 2021, mainly due to a decrease in deposits with the Bank of Canada, partly offset by an increase in deposits with the U.S. Federal Reserve. The high level of cash and deposits with financial institutions is explained in part by the excess liquidity related to the accommodative monetary policies that have been applied by central banks since 2020. The Bank's liquidity and funding risk management practices are described on pages 91 to 100 of this MD&A.\n\n## S Seeccuurriittiieess\n\nSecurities, totalling $109.7 billion as at October 31, 2022, rose $3.4 billion since October 31, 2021, due to a $2.6 billion or 3% increase in securities at fair value through profit or loss, notably securities issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government and by U.S. Treasury, other U.S. agencies, and other foreign governments, partly offset by a decrease in equity securities. Securities other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss were also up, rising $0.8 billion. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed rose $19.0 billion, an increase that is mainly related to the activities of the Financial Markets segment and of Treasury. The Bank's market risk management policies are described on pages 84 to 90 of this MD&A.\n\n## L Looaannss  aanndd  AAcccceeppttaanncceess\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, loans and acceptances, net of allowances for credit losses, accounted for 51% of total assets and totalled $206.7 billion, rising $24.0 billion or 13% since October 31, 2021.\n\nResidential mortgage loans outstanding amounted to $80.1 billion as at October 31, 2022, rising $7.6 billion or 10% since October 31, 2021. This growth was mainly driven by sustained demand for mortgage credit in the Personal and Commercial segment as well as by the activities of the Financial Markets segment and the ABA Bank and Credigy subsidiaries. Personal loans totalled $45.3 billion at year-end 2022, rising $4.2 billion from $41.1 billion since October 31, 2021. This increase came mainly from business growth in Personal Banking and at ABA Bank. At $2.4 billion, credit card receivables rose $0.2 billion since October 31, 2021, as the consumer spending habits of clients gradually resumed and resulted in a notable increase in purchasing volume.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, loans and acceptances to business and government totalled $79.9 billion, a $12.0 billion or 18% increase since October 31, 2021 that was mainly due to business growth in Commercial Banking, in the corporate financial services, and at ABA Bank.",

As for net impaired loans, they totalled $1,030 million as at October 31, 2022 compared to $836 million as at October 31, 2021. Net impaired loans excluding POCI loans amounted to $479 million, rising $196 million from $283 million as at October 31, 2021. This increase was essentially due to the loan portfolio of the Financial Markets segment and to the loan portfolio of ABA Bank, as the COVID-19 relief measures that had been granted to this subsidiary's clients ceased. The increase was partly offset by decreases in the net impaired loans of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio and of the Credigy loan portfolio (excluding POCI loans). Net POCI loans stood at $551 million as at October 31, 2022 compared to $553 million as at October 31, 2021.\n\nA detailed description of the Bank's credit risk management practices is provided on pages 75 to 83 of this MD&A as well as in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## OOtthheerr  AAsssseettss\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, other assets totalled $28.9 billion versus $25.2 billion as at October 31, 2021, a $3.7 billion increase that came mainly from a $2.0 billion increase in derivative financial instruments, related to the activities of the Financial Markets segment, and from a $1.4 billion increase in receivables, prepaid expenses and other items.\n\n## D Deeppoossiittss\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, deposits stood at $266.4 billion, rising $25.5 billion or 11% since the end of fiscal 2021. At $78.8 billion, personal deposits, as presented in Table 12 (page 121), accounted for 30% of all deposits, and had increased $8.7 billion since October 31, 2021. This increase was driven by business growth in Personal Banking, in both the Wealth Management and Financial Markets segments, and at ABA Bank.\n\nAs shown in Table 12, business and government deposits totalled $184.2 billion as at October 31, 2022, rising $16.3 billion from $167.9 billion as at October 31, 2021. This increase came from the funding activities of the Financial Markets segment and of Treasury, including $2.0 billion in deposits subject to bank recapitalization (bail-in) conversion regulations, as well as from business and government deposits from the business activities of Commercial Banking and Wealth Management.

This increase was due to net income net of dividends, to the $500 million issuance of LRCN - Series 3, to the issuances of common shares under the Stock Option Plan, to the net fair value change attributable to the credit risk on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, and to accumulated other comprehensive income, notably net unrealized foreign currency translation gains on investments in foreign operations. These increases were partly offset by the repurchases of common shares for cancellation and by remeasurements of pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans.\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity on page 136 of this Annual Report present the items that make up equity.

The EDTF published a report containing 32 recommendations. The risk disclosures required by the EDTF are provided in this Annual Report and in the documents entitled Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3 Disclosure and Supplementary Financial Information, which are available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca. In addition, on page 13 of this Annual Report is a table of contents that readers can use to locate information relative to the 32 recommendations.\n\nThe FSB recommendations seek to enhance the transparency and measurement of certain exposures, in particular structured entities, subprime and Alt-A exposures, collateralized debt obligations, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and leveraged financing structures. The Bank does not market any specific mortgage financing program to subprime or Alt-A clients. The Bank does not have any significant direct position in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities that are not insured by the CMHC.

Under the first program, the Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgage loans and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of mortgage bonds insured by CMHC. Moreover, these mortgage bonds feature an interest rate swap agreement under which a CMHC-certified counterparty pays CHT the interest due to investors and receives the interest on the NHA securities. As at October 31, 2022, the outstanding amount of NHA securities issued by the Bank and sold to CHT was $24.1 billion. The mortgage loans sold consist of fixed- or variable-rate residential loans that are insured against potential losses by a loan insurer. In accordance with the NHA-MBS Program, the Bank advances the funds required to cover late payments and, if necessary, obtains reimbursement from the insurer that insured the loan. The NHA-MBS and CMB programs do not use liquidity guarantee arrangements. The Bank uses these securitization programs mainly to diversify its funding sources. In accordance with IFRS, because the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the mortgage loans transferred to CHT, the derecognition criteria are not met. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans securitized under the CMB Program continue to be recognized in Loans on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the liabilities for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Credit Card Receivables\n\nIn April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its program of securitizing credit card receivables on a revolving basis. The Bank uses this entity for capital management and funding purposes. The Bank acts as the servicer of the receivables sold and maintains the client relationship. Furthermore, it administers the securitization program and ensures that all related procedures are stringently followed and that investors are paid according to the provisions of the program.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the credit card receivables portfolio held by CCCT II represented an amount outstanding of $2.1 billion. CCCT II issued notes to investors, $0.1 billion of which is held by third parties and $1.3 billion is held by the Bank. CCCT II also issued a bank certificate held by the Bank that stood at $0.7 billion as at October 31, 2022. New receivables are periodically sold to the structure on a revolving basis to replace the receivables reimbursed by clients.\n\nThe different series of notes are rated by the Fitch and DBRS Morningstar (DBRS) rating agencies. From this portfolio of sold receivables, the Bank retains the excess spread, i.e., the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid, and thus provides first-loss protection. Furthermore, second-loss protection for issued series is provided by notes subordinated to the senior notes, representing 5.8% of the total amount of the series issued. The Bank controls CCCT II and thus consolidates it.\n\n## S Seeccuurriittiizzaattiioonn  ooff  TThhiirrdd--PPaarrttyy  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nThe Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the acquired assets.

This process aims to determine the capital level that the Bank needs to maintain to pursue its business activities and accommodate unexpected losses arising from extremely adverse economic and operational conditions. The Bank has implemented a rigorous internal capital adequacy assessment process that comprises the following procedures:\n\n- \uf0b7 conducting an overall risk assessment;\n- \uf0b7 measuring significant risks and the capital requirements related to the Bank's financial budget for the next fiscal year and current and prospective risk profiles;\n- \uf0b7 integrating stress tests across the organization and executing sensitivity analyses to determine the capital buffer above minimum regulatory levels (for additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see the Risk Management section of this MD&A);\n- \uf0b7 aggregating capital and monitoring the reasonableness of internal capital compared with regulatory capital;\n- \uf0b7 comparing projected internal capital against regulatory capital levels, internal operating targets, and competing banks;\n- \uf0b7 attesting to the adequacy of the Bank's capital levels.\n\nAssessing capital adequacy is an integral part of capital planning and strategy. The Bank sets internal operating targets that include a discretionary cushion in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, which provides a solid financial structure and sufficient capital to meet management's business needs in accordance with its risk appetite, along with competitive returns to shareholders, under both normal market conditions and a range of severe but plausible stress testing scenarios. The internal capital adequacy assessment process is a key tool in establishing the Bank's capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments.\n\nRisk-adjusted return on capital and shareholder value added (SVA), which are obtained from an assessment of required economic capital, are calculated quarterly for each of the Bank's business segments.

A less complex approach, such as the Standardized Approach, uses regulatory weightings, while a more complex approach uses the Bank's internal estimates of risk components to establish risk-weighted assets and calculate regulatory capital.\n\nAs required under Basel, risk-weighted assets (RWA) are calculated for each credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. The Bank uses the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB) Approach for credit risk to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for a majority of its portfolios. The credit risk of certain portfolios considered to be less significant is weighted according to the Basel Standardized Approach. The simple risk-weighted method is used to calculate the charge related to banking book equity securities. This method requires proactive management of the capital allocated to portfolios with banking book equity securities, since, beyond a certain investment threshold, the cost of regulatory capital becomes prohibitive. As for operational risk, the Bank uses the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are primarily determined using the Internal Model-Based Approach, while the Standardized Approach is used to assess interest-rate specific risk.\n\nWith respect to the risk related to securitization operations, the capital treatment depends on the type of underlying exposures and on the information available about the exposures. The Bank must use the Securitization: Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) if it is able to apply an approved internal ratings-based model and has sufficient information to calculate the capital requirements for all underlying exposures in the securitization pool. Under this approach, RWA is derived from a combination of supervisory inputs and inputs specific to the securitization exposure, such as the implicit capital charge related to the underlying exposures, the credit enhancement level, the effective maturity, the number of exposures, and the weighted average loss given default (LGD).\n\nIf the Bank cannot use the SEC-IRBA, it must use the Securitization: External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) for the securitization exposures that are externally rated. This approach assigns risk weights to exposures using external ratings. The Bank uses the ratings assigned by Moody's, Standard & Poor's (S&P), Fitch, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or DBRS or a combination of these ratings. The Bank uses the Securitization: Internal Assessment Approach (SEC-IAA) for unrated securitization exposures relating to the asset-backed commercial paper conduits it sponsors. The SEC-IAA rating methodologies used are mainly based on criteria published by the above-mentioned credit rating agencies and consider risk factors that the Bank deems relevant to assessing the credit quality of the exposures. The Bank's SEC-IAA includes an assessment of the extent by which the credit enhancement available for loss protection provides coverage of expected losses. The levels of stressed coverage the Bank requires for each internal risk rating are consistent with the requirements published by the rating agencies for equivalent external ratings by asset class. If the Bank cannot apply the SEC-ERBA or the SEC-IAA, it must use the supervisory formula under the Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC-SA). Under this approach, RWA is derived from inputs specific to the securitization exposure, such as the implicit capital charge related to the underlying exposures calculated under the standardized credit risk approach as well as credit enhancement and delinquency levels.\n\nIf none of the above approaches can be used, the securitization exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250%. The Bank can apply a reduced capital charge for securitization exposures that meet the criteria of the Simple, Transparent and Comparable (STC) framework.\n\nCapital ratios are calculated by dividing capital by risk-weighted assets. Credit, market, and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets calculation for regulatory purposes. Basel rules apply at the consolidated level of the Bank. Assets of non-consolidated entities for regulatory purposes are therefore excluded from the risk-weighted assets calculation.\n\nThe definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders' equity less goodwill, intangible assets, and other CET1 capital deductions. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital consists of eligible non-cumulative preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes (LRCN), and other AT1 capital adjustments. The sum of CET1 and AT1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of eligible subordinated debts and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "OSFI is responsible for applying the Basel Accord in Canada. As required under the Basel Accord, OSFI requires that recognized regulatory capital instruments other than common equity must have a non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) clause to ensure that investors bear losses before taxpayers should the government determine that it is in the public interest to rescue a non-viable financial institution. As at October 31, 2022, all of the Bank's regulatory capital instruments, other than common shares, have an NVCC clause. Furthermore, in the regulations of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act and the Bank Act (Canada), the Government of Canada has provided detailed information on conversion, issuance, and compensation regimes for bail-in instruments issued by Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) (collectively the Bail-In Regulations). Pursuant to the CDIC Act, in circumstances where OSFI has determined that the Bank has ceased, or is about to cease, to be viable, the Governor in Council may, upon a Minister of Finance recommendation indicating that he or she believes that it is in the public interest to do so, grant an order directing CDIC to convert all or a portion of certain shares and liabilities of the Bank into common shares (a 'Bail-In Conversion').\n\nThe Bail-In Regulations governing the conversion and issuance of bail-in instruments came into force on September 23, 2018, and those governing compensation for holders of converted instruments came into force on March 27, 2018. Any shares and liabilities issued before the date that the Bail-In Regulations came into force are not subject to a Bail-In Conversion, unless, in the case of a liability, the terms of said liability are, on or after that day, amended to increase its principal amount or to extend its term to maturity, and the liability, as amended, meets the requirements to be subject to a Bail-In Conversion.\n\nThe Bail-In Regulations prescribe the types of shares and liabilities that are subject to a Bail-In Conversion. In general, any senior debt securities with an initial or amended term-to-maturity greater than 400 days that are unsecured or partially secured and have been assigned a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP), an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), or similar identification number are subject to a Bail-In Conversion. However, certain other debt obligations of the Bank, such as structured notes (as defined in the Bail-In Regulations), covered bonds, deposits and certain derivative financial instruments, are not subject to a bail-in conversion.\n\nThe Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain the following minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 12.0%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 14.0%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% established by the BCBS and OSFI, a 1.0% surcharge applicable solely to D-SIBs, and a 2.5% domestic stability buffer established by OSFI. The domestic stability buffer, which varies from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement is not subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but must provide a remediation plan to OSFI. The banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II Standardized Approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 70% of the capital requirement as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to risk-weighted assets. OSFI requires Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative financial instruments exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total exposure.\n\nOSFI's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline, which applies to all D-SIBs under the federal government's bail-in regulations, is to ensure that a D-SIB has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization in the unlikely event it becomes non-viable. Available TLAC includes total capital as well as certain senior unsecured debts that satisfy all of the eligibility criteria of OSFI's TLAC guideline. Since November 1, 2021, OSFI has been requiring D-SIBs to maintain a risk-based TLAC ratio of at least 24.0% (including the domestic stability buffer) of risk-weighted assets and a TLAC leverage ratio of at least 6.75%. The TLAC ratio is calculated by dividing available TLAC by risk-weighted assets, and the TLAC leverage ratio is calculated by dividing available TLAC by total exposure. As at October 31, 2022, outstanding liabilities of $13.9 billion ($11.9 billion as at October 31, 2021) were subject to conversion under the Bail-In Regulations.",

By maintaining a strong capital structure, the Bank can cover the risks inherent to its business activities, support its business segments, and protect its clients.\n\nOther disclosure requirements pursuant to Pillar 3 of the Basel Accord and a set of recommendations defined by the EDTF are presented in the Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3 Disclosure report published quarterly and available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca. Furthermore, a complete list of capital instruments and their main features is also available on the Bank's website.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  CCoonntteexxtt\n\nThe Bank closely monitors regulatory developments and participates actively in various consultative processes. In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020 OSFI had announced a series of regulatory adjustments to support the financial and operational resilience of banks. The measures announced by OSFI that have continued to have an impact on the Bank for the year ended October 31, 2022 are described below. Also presented below are brief descriptions of ongoing regulatory projects.\n\n## COVID-19 relief measures still in effect as at October 31, 2022:\n\n- \uf0b7 Treatment of regulatory capital for expected credit loss accounting purposes: OSFI introduced transitional arrangements applicable to the ECL provisioning method set out in the Basel framework. Under the arrangements, a portion of allowances that would otherwise have been included in Tier 2 capital is included in CET1 capital. The increased amount is adjusted for tax effects and multiplied by a scaling factor that decreases over time. The scaling factor was set at 70% for fiscal 2020, at 50% for fiscal 2021, and at 25% for fiscal 2022. These arrangements ceased to apply on November 1, 2022.\n- \uf0b7 Capital floor: OSFI lowered the floor factor from 75% to 70%, which will stay in place until the domestic implementation of the Basel III capital floor comes into effect in the second quarter of 2023.\n- \uf0b7 Leverage ratio: OSFI is continuing to allow banks to temporarily exclude exposures from central bank reserves for leverage ratio purposes. On September 13, 2022, OSFI announced that this temporary exclusion will cease to apply on April 1, 2023.\n\n## Basel III Reform\n\nIn December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the BCBS, endorsed the outstanding Basel III postcrisis regulatory reforms. The purpose of the approved reforms, set out in Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms, is to reduce excessive variability in riskweighted assets and improve comparability and transparency among bank capital ratios.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, GHOS announced a postponement to the implementation of the Basel III international capital standard reform. OSFI therefore postponed, until the first quarter of 2023, the implementation of the Standardized Approach and Advanced IRB Approach to credit risk, the revision of the operational risk framework and of the leverage ratio framework, and the introduction of a more risksensitive capital floor. Implementation of the Pillar 3 financial disclosure requirements finalized by the BCBS in December 2018 was also postponed until at least the first quarter of 2023. On November 29, 2021, OSFI postponed the implementation of the above-mentioned Basel III reform items to the second quarter of 2023. Lastly, implementation of the final set of revisions to the new market risk framework, entitled Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and published in January 2019, and implementation of the revised credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework are being postponed to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn January 31, 2022, OSFI released its final capital and liquidity rules that incorporate the final Basel III reforms, and on February 7, 2022, OSFI published corresponding changes to the regulatory returns, i.e., the Basel Capital Adequacy Return (BCAR) and the Leverage Requirements Return (LRR).\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Other Projects\n\nOn March 31, 2022, OSFI released, for consultation purposes, a draft guideline entitled Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns. OSFI relies largely on the regulatory returns produced by financial institutions when assessing their safety and soundness. The purpose of this draft guideline is to better inform auditors and institutions on the work to be performed on regulatory returns in order to clarify and align OSFI's assurance expectations across all financial institutions. On November 7, 2022, OSFI released the final version of this guideline, which notably addresses the assurance that must be provided by external auditors, senior management attestation, the assurance that must be provided by internal auditors, and the effective dates, which will range from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, the BCBS published its second public consultation on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset risk exposures faced by banks. This consultation builds on preliminary proposals from the first consultation published in June 2021 and the responses received. The BCBS plans to finalize the standards by the end of 2022. The Bank is actively participating in this consultation. On August 18, 2022, OSFI released an advisory on interim arrangements for dealing with cryptoassets held by federally regulated financial institutions, which outlines its prudential expectations on cryptoasset holdings and sets exposure limits. OSFI also provided guidance on the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of cryptoasset exposures. These interim arrangements will take effect in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n## C Caappiittaall  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  iinn  22002222\n\n## M Maannaaggeemmeenntt  AAccttiivviittiieess\n\nOn November 4, 2021, OSFI amended its capital distribution expectations, namely, by permitting financial institutions to increase regular dividends and, subject to OSFI approval, to buy back shares.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid, which began on December 10, 2021, to repurchase for cancellation up to 7,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 2% of its common shares outstanding) over a 12-month period ending no later than December 9, 2022. This normal course issuer bid was approved by OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on December 8, 2021. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank repurchased 2,500,000 common shares under this program for $245 million, which reduced Common share capital by $24 million and Retained earnings by $221 million.\n\nOn July 25, 2022, the Bank issued medium-term notes for an amount of $750 million, bearing interest at 5.426% and maturing on August 16, 2032. As these medium-term notes satisfy the NVCC requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\nOn August 31, 2022, the Bank redeemed the US$7 million non-NVCC debentures denominated in foreign currency and maturing on February 28, 2087 at a price equal to their nominal value plus accrued interest.\n\nOn September 8, 2022, the Bank issued $500 million of LRCN - Series 3 for which noteholder recourse is limited to the assets held by an independent trustee in a consolidated limited recourse trust. The trust's assets consist of $500 million of Series 46 First Preferred Shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 3. The LRCN - Series 3 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.50% per annum until November 16, 2027 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the yield on five-year Government of Canada bonds plus 4.281% until November 16, 2077. Since the LRCN - Series 3 satisfy the NVCC requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the Bank had 336,582,124 issued and outstanding common shares compared to 337,912,283 a year earlier. It also had 66,000,000 issued and outstanding preferred shares, unchanged from October 31, 2021. In addition, as at October 31, 2022, the Bank had 1,500,000 LRCN compared to 1,000,000 a year earlier.

        "page_content": "## D Diivviiddeennddss\n\nThe Bank's strategy for common share dividends is to aim for a dividend payout ratio of between 40% and 50% of net income attributable to common shareholders, taking into account such factors as financial position, cash needs, regulatory requirements, and any other factor deemed relevant by the Board.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Bank declared $1,206 million in dividends to common shareholders, which represents 36.8% of net income attributable to common shareholders (2021: 31.7%). The declared dividends are below the target payout range given the interruption to dividend increases prescribed by OSFI at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. OSFI has only been allowing Canadian banks to make capital distribution decisions, i.e., dividend increases and share buybacks, since November 4, 2021. Given the economic conditions during fiscal 2022, the Bank has taken a prudent approach to managing regulatory capital and remains confident in its ability to increase earnings going forward.\n\n## S Shhaarreess,,  OOtthheerr  EEqquuiittyy  IInnssttrruummeennttss,,  aanndd  SSttoocckk  OOppttiioonnss\n\n|                          | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222     | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                          | N Nuummbbeerr  ooff  sshhaarreess  oorr  LLRRCCNN | $ $  mmiilllliioonn                             |\n| First preferred shares   |                                                   |                                                 |\n| Series 30                | 1 144,,000000,,000000                             | 3 35500                                         |\n| Series 32                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n| Series 38                | 1 166,,000000,,000000                             | 4 40000                                         |\n| Series 40                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n| Series 42                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n|                          | 6 666,,000000,,000000                             | 1 1,,665500                                     |\n| Other equity instruments |                                                   |                                                 |\n| LRCN  -  Series 1        | 5 50000,,000000                                   | 5 50000                                         |\n| LRCN  -  Series 2        | 5 50000,,000000                                   | 5 50000                                         |\n| LRCN - Series 3          | 5 50000,,000000                                   | 5 50000                                         |\n|                          | 1 1,,550000,,000000                               | 1 1,,550000                                     |\n|                          | 6 677,,550000,,000000                             | 3 3,,115500                                     |\n| Common shares            | 3 33366,,558822,,112244                           | 3 3,,119966                                     |\n| Stock options            | 1 111,,886611,,774499                             |                                                 |\n\nAs at November 25, 2022, there were 336,734,809 common shares and 11,714,314 stock options outstanding. NVCC provisions require the conversion of capital instruments into a variable number of common shares should OSFI deem a bank to be non-viable or should the government publicly announce that a bank has accepted or agreed to accept an injection of capital. If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, all of the Bank's preferred shares, LRCNs, and mediumterm notes maturing on February 1, 2028 and August 16, 2032, which are NVCC capital instruments, would be converted into common shares of the Bank according to an automatic conversion formula at a conversion price corresponding to the greater of the following amounts: (i) a $5.00 contractual floor price; or (ii) the market price of the Bank's common shares on the date of the trigger event (10-day weighted average price). Based on a $5.00 floor price and including an estimate for accrued dividends and interest, these NVCC capital instruments would be converted into a maximum of 1,093 million Bank common shares, which would have a 76.5% dilutive effect based on the number of Bank common shares outstanding as at October 31, 2022.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

All of the capital ratios have therefore increased since October 31, 2021, essentially due to net income net of dividends and to common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan. These factors were partly offset by growth in RWA, common share repurchases, and the impact of the transitional measures applicable to ECL provisioning, of which the scaling factor decreased from 50% to 25%. The increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was also due to the $500 million issuance of limited recourse capital notes, i.e., Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) - Series 3, on September 8, 2022. The increase in the Total capital ratio was also due to the $750 million issuance of medium-term notes on July 25, 2022. As at October 31, 2022, the leverage ratio was 4.5% compared to 4.4% as at October 31, 2021. The growth in Tier 1 capital was partly offset by growth in total exposure, which will continue to benefit, until April 1, 2023, from the temporary measure permitted by OSFI with respect to the exclusion of exposures from central bank reserves.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022, the Bank's TLAC ratio and TLAC leverage ratio were, respectively, 27.7% and 8.1%, compared with 26.3% and 7.8%, respectively, as at October 31, 2021. The increase in the TLAC ratio was due to the same factors as those provided for the Total capital ratio and to the net TLAC instrument issuances during the period. The increase in the TLAC leverage ratio was due to the same factors as those provided for the leverage ratio and to the net TLAC instrument issuances.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI's regulatory capital, leverage, and TLAC requirements.\n\n## RReegguullaattoorryy  CCaappiittaall (1) , ,  LLeevveerraaggee  RRaattiioo (1) aanndd  TTLLAACC (2)\n\nAs at October 31\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)              | 2 2002222             | 2 2002222       | 2021         | 2021         |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                             | A Addjjuusstteedd (3) | Adjusted (3)    | Adjusted (3) | Adjusted (3) |\n| C Caappiittaall                             |                       |                 |              |              |\n| CET1                                        | 1 144,,776633         | 1 144,,881188   | 12,866       | 12,973       |\n| Tier 1                                      | 1 177,,990066         | 1 177,,996611   | 15,515       | 15,622       |\n| Total                                       | 1 199,,772277         | 1 199,,772277   | 16,643       | 16,643       |\n| R Riisskk--wweeiigghhtteedd  aasssseettss   | 1 11166,,884400       | 1 11166,,884400 | 104,358      | 104,358      |\n| T Toottaall  eexxppoossuurree               | 4 40011,,778800       | 4 40011,,778800 | 351,160      | 351,160      |\n| C Caappiittaall  rraattiiooss               |                       |                 |              |              |\n| CET1                                        | 1 122..66   % %       | 1 122..77   % % | 12.3  %      | 12.4  %      |\n| Tier 1                                      | 1 155..33   % %       | 1 155..44   % % | 14.9  %      | 15.0  %      |\n| Total                                       | 1 166..99   % %       | 1 166..99   % % | 15.9  %      | 15.9  %      |\n| L Leevveerraaggee  rraattiioo               | 4 4..55   % %         | 4 4..55   % %   | 4.4  %       | 4.4  %       |\n| A Avvaaiillaabbllee  TTLLAACC (2)           | 3 322,,335511         | 3 322,,335511   | 27,492       | 27,492       |\n| T TLLAACC  rraattiioo (2)                   | 2 277..77   % %       | 2 277..77   % % | 26.3  %      | 26.3  %      |\n| T TLLAACC  lleevveerraaggee  rraattiioo (2) | 8 8..11               | 8 8..11   % %   | 7.8  %       | 7.8  %       |\n|                                             | % %                   |                 |              |              |",

RWA movements attributable to book size include increases or decreases in exposures, measured by exposure at default, assuming a stable risk profile.\n\nThe Book quality item is the Bank's best estimate of changes in book quality related to experience, such as underlying customer behaviour or demographics, including changes resulting from model recalibrations or realignments and also including risk mitigation factors.\n\nThe Model updates item is used to reflect implementations of new models, changes in model scope, and any other change applied to address model malfunctions. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank updated the models used for retail lines of credit, mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and certain non-retail exposures. It also changed the SVaR period of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) to the 2020 COVID-19 period at the start of the second quarter of 2022 and then returned to the 2008 GFC period towards the end of the same quarter. Lastly, the Bank transitioned a retail loan portfolio from the Standardized Approach to the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB) Approach for measuring credit risk.\n\nThe Methodology and policy item presents the impact of changes in calculation methods resulting from changes in regulatory policies or from new regulations. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank decided to early adopt the Basel III reform requirements related to risk parameter floors for certain exposures calculated using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach for credit risk.",

Economic capital takes into consideration the credit, market, operational, business, and other risks to which the Bank is exposed as well as the risk diversification effect among them and among the business segments. Economic capital thus helps the Bank to determine the capital required to protect itself against such risks and ensure its long-term viability. The by-segment allocation of economic capital and regulatory RWA was carried out on a stand-alone basis before attribution of goodwill and intangible assets. The method used to assess economic capital is reviewed regularly in order to accurately quantify these risks.\n\nThe Risk Management section of this MD&A provides comprehensive information about the main types of risk. The 'Other risks' presented below include risks such as business risk and structural interest rate risk in addition to the benefit of diversification among types of risk.\n\n## AAllllooccaattiioonn  ooff  RRiisskkss  bbyy  BBuussiinneessss  SSeeggmmeenntt\n\nAs at October 31, 2022 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n## B Buussiinneessss s seeggmmeennttss\n\nM Maajjoorr  aaccttiivviittiieess\n\n## E Eccoonnoommiicc  ccaappiittaall b byy  ttyyppee  ooff  rriisskk\n\nR Riisskk--wweeiigghhtteedd\n\na\n\nasssseettss\n\n(1)\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall  aanndd  CCoommmmeerrcciiaall\n\n## W Weeaalltthh  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  MMaarrkkeettss\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCredit\n\nMarket\n\nOperational\n\nOther risks\n\nT\n\nToottaall\n\n3\n\nCredit\n\nMarket\n\nOperational\n\nT Toottaall\n\n4 477,,116611\n\n| Private banking                              |\n|----------------------------------------------|\n| Direct brokerage                             |\n| Investment solutions                         |\n| Administrative and trade  execution services |\n| advisors                                     |\n| Trust and estate                             |\n| Transaction products for                     |\n| services                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Credit      | 74      |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Market      | -       |\n| Operational | 299     |\n| Other risks | 475     |\n| T Toottaall | 8 84488 |\n\n| Credit      | 2,686       |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Market      | 324         |\n| Operational | 350         |\n| Other risks | 765         |\n| T Toottaall | 4 4,,112255 |\n\n| Credit      | 1,529       |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Market      | -           |\n| Operational | 3,711       |\n| T Toottaall | 5 5,,224400 |\n\nCredit\n\nMarket\n\nOperational\n\n32,557\n\n5,891\n\n4,321\n\nT Toottaall\n\n4 422,,776699\n\nCredit\n\nMarket\n\nOperational\n\n14,199\n\n-\n\n1,677\n\nT\n\nToottaall\n\n1 155,,887766\n\n| Credit      | 6,356      |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Market      | 134        |\n| Operational | (696)      |\n| T Toottaall | 55,,779944 |\n\n- (1) See the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 16 to 21 for additional information on capital management measures.\n\nNational Bank of Canada\n\nCredit\n\nMarket\n\nOperational\n\nOther risks\n\nToottaall\n\n1\n\n1,177\n\n-\n\n134\n\n72\n\n1,,338833\n\n| Credit      | 134         |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| Market      | (91)        |\n| Operational | (56)        |\n| Other risks | (557)       |\n| T Toottaall | ( (557700)) |\n\n3,120\n\n-\n\n459\n\n282\n\n3,,886611\n\nT\n\n41,500\n\n-\n\n5,661\n\n## N Naattiioonnaall BBaannkk ooff CCaannaaddaa\n\n## U U..SS..

The Bank views risk as an integral part of its development and the diversification of its activities. It advocates a risk management approach that is consistent with its business strategy. The Bank voluntarily exposes itself to certain risk categories, particularly credit and market risk, in order to generate revenue. It also assumes certain risks that are inherent to its activities-to which it does not choose to expose itself-and that do not generate revenue, i.e., mainly operational risks. The purpose of sound and effective risk management is to provide reasonable assurance that incurred risks do not exceed acceptable thresholds, to control the volatility in the Bank's results, and to ensure that risk-taking contributes to the creation of shareholder value.\n\n## R Riisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nRisk is rigorously managed. Risks are identified, measured, and controlled to achieve an appropriate balance between returns obtained and risks assumed. Decision-making is therefore guided by risk assessments that align with the Bank's risk appetite and by prudent levels of capital and liquidity. Despite the exercise of stringent risk management and existing mitigation measures, risk cannot be eliminated entirely, and residual risks may occasionally cause significant losses.\n\nThe Bank has developed guidelines that support sound and effective risk management and that help preserve its reputation, brand, and long-term viability :\n\n- \u00b7 risk is everyone's business: the business units, the risk management and oversight functions, and Internal Audit all play an important role in ensuring a risk management framework is in place; operational transformations and simplifications are conducted without compromising rigorous risk management;\n- \u00b7 client-centric: having quality information is key to understanding clients, effectively managing risk, and delivering excellent client service;\n- \u00b7 enterprise-wide: an integrated view of risk is the basis for sound and effective risk management and decision-making by management;\n- \u00b7 human capital: the Bank's employees are engaged, experienced and have a high level of expertise; their curiosity supports continuous development and their rigour ensures that risk management is built into the corporate culture; incentive-based compensation programs are designed to adhere to the Bank's risk tolerance;\n- \u00b7 fact-based: good risk management relies heavily on common sense and good judgment and on advanced systems and models.\n\n## RRiisskk  AAppppeettiittee\n\nRisk appetite represents how much risk an organization is willing to assume to achieve its business strategy. The Bank defines its risk appetite by setting tolerance thresholds, by aligning those thresholds with its business strategy, and by integrating risk management throughout its corporate culture. Risk appetite is built into decision-making processes as well as into strategic, financial, and capital planning.\n\nThe Bank's risk appetite framework consists of principles, statements, metrics as well as targets and is reinforced by policies and limits. When setting its risk appetite targets, the Bank considers regulatory constraints and the expectations of stakeholders, in particular customers, employees, the community, shareholders, regulatory agencies, governments, and rating agencies. The risk appetite framework is defined by the following principles and statements:\n\nThe Bank's reputation, brand and long-term viability are at the centre of our decisions, which demand:\n\n- \u00b7 a strong credit rating to be maintained;\n- \u00b7 a strong capital and cash position;\n- \u00b7 rigorous management of regulatory compliance risk, including sales practices;\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance for negligence in information security.\n\nThe Bank understands the risks taken; they are aligned with our business strategy and translate into:\n\n- \u00b7 a risk-reward balance;\n- \u00b7 a stable risk profile;\n- \u00b7 a strategic level of concentration aligned with approved targets.\n\nThe Bank's transformation and simplification plan is being carried out without compromising rigorous risk management, which is reflected in:\n\n- \u00b7 a low tolerance to operational and reputation risk;\n- \u00b7 operational and information systems stability, both under normal circumstances and in times of crisis.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's management and business units are involved in the risk appetite setting process and are responsible for adequately monitoring the chosen risk indicators. These needs are assessed by means of the enterprise strategic planning process. The risk indicators are reported on a regular basis to ensure an effective alignment between the Bank's risk profile and its risk appetite, failing which appropriate actions might be taken. Additional information on the key credit, market and liquidity risk indicators monitored by the Bank's management is presented on the following pages.\n\n## EEnntteerrpprriissee--WWiiddee  SSttrreessss  TTeessttiinngg\n\nAn enterprise-wide stress testing program is in place at the Bank. It is part of a more extensive process aimed at ensuring that the Bank maintains adequate capital levels commensurate with its business strategy and risk appetite. Stress testing can be defined as a risk management method that assesses the potential effects-on the Bank's financial position, capital and liquidity-of a series of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible events. The program supports management's decision-making process by identifying potential vulnerabilities for the Bank as a whole and that are considered in setting limits as well as in longer term business planning. The scenarios and stress test results are approved by the Stress Testing Oversight Committee and are reviewed by the Global Risk Committee (GRC) and the Risk Management Committee (RMC). For additional information, see the Stress Testing section of this MD&A applicable to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\n\n## IInnccoorrppoorraattiioonn  ooff  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  IInnttoo  tthhee  CCoorrppoorraattee  CCuullttuurree\n\nRisk management is supported by the Bank's cultural evolution through, notably, the following pillars:\n\n- \uf0b7 Tone set by management: The Bank's management continually promotes risk management through internal communications. The Bank's risk appetite is therefore known to all.\n- \uf0b7 Shared accountability: A balanced approach is advocated, whereby business development initiatives are combined with a constant focus on sound and effective risk management. In particular, risk is taken into consideration when preparing the business plans of the business segments, when analyzing strategic initiatives, and when launching new products.\n- \uf0b7 Transparency: A foundation of the business's values, transparency lets us communicate our concerns quickly without fear of reprisal. We are a learning-focused organization where employees are allowed to make mistakes.\n- \uf0b7 Behaviour: The Bank's risk management is strengthened by incentive compensation programs that are structured to reflect the Bank's risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Continuous development: All employees must complete mandatory annual regulatory compliance training focused on the Bank's Code of Conduct and on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) efforts as well as cybersecurity training. Risk management training is also offered across all of the Bank's business units.\n\nIn addition to these five pillars, Internal Audit carries out an evaluation of the corporate culture as part of its mandate. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the existing risk management framework, the Bank has defined clear roles and responsibilities by reinforcing the concept of the three lines of defence. The Governance Structure section presented on the following pages defines this concept as well as the roles and responsibilities of the three lines of defence.\n\n## F Fiirrsstt  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee Risk Owner\n\n## S Seeccoonndd  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee Independent Oversight\n\n## T Thhiirrdd  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee Independent Assurance\n\nBusiness Units\n\nRisk Management and Oversight Functions\n\nInternal Audit\n\n- \u2022 Identify, manage, assess and mitigate risks in day-to-day activities.\n- \u2022 Ensure activities are in alignment with the Bank's risk appetite and risk management policies.\n- \u2022 Oversee risk management by setting policies and standards.\n- \u2022 Provide independent oversight of management practices and an independent challenge of the first line of defence.\n- \u2022 Promote sound and effective risk management at the Bank.\n- \u2022 Monitor and report on risk.\n- \u2022 Provide the Board and management with independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems.\n- \u2022 Provide recommendations and advice to promote the Bank's long-term financial strength.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It also approves and oversees the Bank's overall risk philosophy and risk appetite, acknowledges and understands the main risks faced by the Bank, and makes sure appropriate systems are in place to effectively manage and control those risks. In addition, the Board ensures that the Bank operates in accordance with environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and strategies. It carries out its mandate both directly and through its committees: the Audit Committee, the Risk Management Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Technology Committee. In addition, the various oversight functions, the Global Risk Committee and the working groups report to the Board and advise it.\n\n## The Audit Committee (1)\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees the work of the Bank's internal auditor and independent auditor; ensures the Bank's financial strength; establishes the Bank's financial reporting framework, analysis processes and internal controls; and reviews any reports of irregularities in accounting, internal controls, or audit.\n\n## The Risk Management Committee (RMC) (1)\n\nThe Risk Management Committee examines the risk appetite framework and recommends it to the Board for approval. It approves the main risk management policies and risk tolerance limits. It ensures that appropriate resources, processes, and procedures are in place to properly and effectively manage risk on an ongoing basis. Finally, it monitors the risk profile and risk trends of the Bank's activities and ensures alignment with the risk appetite.\n\n## The Human Resources Committee (1)\n\nThe Human Resources Committee examines and approves the Bank's total compensation policies and programs, taking into consideration the risk management framework and ESG strategies, and recommends their approval to the Board. It recommends, for Board approval, the compensation of the President and Chief Executive Officer, of the members of the Senior Leadership Team, and of the heads of the oversight functions. This committee oversees all human resources practices, including employee health and well-being, talent management matters such as succession planning for management and oversight functions, as well as inclusion and diversity.\n\n## The Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee (1)\n\nThe Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee ensures that the Bank maintains sound practices that comply with legislation and best practices, particularly in the area of ESG responsibilities, and that they align with the Bank's One Mission. It periodically reviews and approves professional conduct and ethical behaviour standards, including the Code of Conduct. The committee oversees the application of complaint review mechanisms and implements mechanisms that ensure compliance with consumer protection provisions, including the Whistleblower Protection Policy, and that prevent prohibited financial transactions between the Bank and related parties. Lastly, it ensures that the directors are qualified by evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its members and by planning director succession and the composition of the Board.\n\n## The Technology Committee (1)\n\nThe Technology Committee oversees the various components of the Bank's technology program. It reviews, among other things, the Bank's technology strategy and monitors technology risks, including cyberrisks, cybercrime, and protection of personal information. The IT Risk Management Strategic Committee and the Privacy Office report to the Technology Committee.\n\n- (1) Additional information about the Bank's governance architecture can be found in the Management Proxy Circular for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Holders of Common Shares, which will soon be available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca and on SEDAR's website at sedar.com.

        "page_content": "## Senior Leadership Team of the Bank\n\nComposed of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the officers responsible for the Bank's main functions and business units, the Bank's Senior Leadership Team ensures that risk management is sound and effective and aligned with the Bank's pursuit of its objectives and strategies. The Senior Leadership Team promotes the integration of risk management into its corporate culture and manages the primary risks facing the Bank.\n\n## The Internal Audit Oversight Function\n\nThe Internal Audit Oversight Function is the third line of defence in the risk management framework. It is responsible for providing the Bank's Board and management with objective, independent assurance on the effectiveness of the main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems and for making recommendations and providing advice to promote the Bank's long-term strength.\n\n## The Finance Oversight Function\n\nThe Finance Oversight Function is responsible for optimizing management of financial resources and ensuring sound governance of financial information. It helps the business segments and support functions with their financial performance, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and carries out the Bank's reporting to shareholders and the external reporting of the various units, entities, and subsidiaries of the Bank. It is responsible for capital management and actively participates in the activities of the Asset/Liability Management Committee.\n\n## The Risk Management Oversight Function\n\nThe Risk Management service is responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring-independently and using an integrated approach-the various risks to which the Bank and its subsidiaries are exposed and for promoting a risk management culture throughout the Bank. The Risk Management team helps the Board and management understand and monitor the main risks. This service also develops, maintains, and communicates the risk appetite framework while overseeing the integrity and reliability of risk measures.\n\n## The Compliance Oversight Function\n\nThe Compliance Oversight Function is responsible for implementing a Bank-wide regulatory compliance risk management framework by relying on an organizational structure that includes functional links to the main business segments. It also exercises independent oversight and conducts assessments of the compliance of the Bank and its subsidiaries with regulatory compliance risk standards and policies.\n\n## The Global Risk Committee (GRC)\n\nThe Global Risk Committee is the overriding governing entity of all the Bank's risk committees, and it oversees every aspect of the overall management of the Bank's risk. It sets the parameters of the policies that determine risk tolerance and the overall risk strategy, for the Bank and its subsidiaries as a whole, and sets limits as well as tolerance and intervention thresholds enabling the Bank to properly manage the main risks to which it is exposed. The committee approves and monitors all large credit facilities. It reports to the Board, and recommends for Board approval, the Bank's risk philosophy, risk appetite, and risk profile management. The Operational Risk Management Committee, the Financial Markets Risk Committee, and the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee presented in the governance structure chart are the primary committees reporting to the Global Risk Committee. The Global Risk Committee also carries out its mandate through the Senior Complex Valuation Committee, the Models Oversight Committee, and the Product and Activity Review Committees.\n\n## The Compensation Risk Oversight Working Group\n\nThe working group that monitors compensation-related risks supports the Human Resources Committee in its compensation risk oversight role. It is made up of at least three members, namely, the Executive Vice-President, Risk Management; the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance; and the Executive Vice-President, Employee Experience. The working group helps to ensure that compensation policies and programs do not unduly encourage senior management members, officers, material risk takers, or bank employees to take risks beyond the Bank's risk tolerance thresholds. As part of that role, it ensures that the Bank is adhering to the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by OSFI and to the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board, for which the Canadian implementation and monitoring is conducted by OSFI. The RMC also reviews the reports presented by this working group.\n\n## The ESG Working Group\n\nUnder the leadership of the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance, and made up of several officers from different areas of the Bank, the ESG Working Group's main role is to develop and support the Bank's environmental, social and governance initiatives and strategies. Its members meet on a monthly basis. The ESG Working Group is responsible for implementing the recommendations made by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and by the UN Principles for Responsible Banking as well as for implementing the Bank's climate commitments. At least twice a year, the ESG Working Group reports to the Conduct Review and Governance Committee on the progress made and on ongoing and upcoming ESG projects. In addition, and in a timely fashion, the ESG Working Group makes presentations on topics of particular interest, such as the TCFD report, to the Audit Committee and the RMC.\n\n## The IT Risk Management Strategic Committee (ITRMSC)\n\nThe Bank's management has entrusted the ITRMSC with responsibility for the governance of technology-related risk and cyberrisk. Under the leadership of the Executive Vice-President, Risk Management and the Executive Vice-President, Technology and Operations, this committee approves the technology and cyberrisk management policy as well as other policies related to technology risk management. Among other responsibilities, it reviews the technology risk and cyberrisk posture as well as any matter requiring an alignment between the technology strategy and the associated risks.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It oversees the development, updating, and application of appropriate documentation in support of the Bank's personal information privacy program, including policies, standards, and procedures. It also oversees the risk governance framework and the implementation of appropriate controls designed to mitigate privacy risk. Lastly, it supports the business units in their execution of the Bank's strategic directions and ensures adherence to privacy best practices.\n\n## The Business Units\n\nAs the first line of defence, the business units manage risks related to their operations within established limits and in accordance with risk management policies by identifying, analyzing, managing, and understanding the risks to which they are exposed and implementing risk mitigation mechanisms. The management of these units must ensure that employees are adhering to current policies and limits.\n\n## RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  PPoolliicciieess\n\nThe risk management policies and related standards and procedures set out responsibilities, define and describe the main business-related risks, specify the requirements that business units must fulfill when assessing and managing these risks, stipulate the authorization process for risk-taking, and set the risk limits to be adhered to. They also establish the accountability reporting that must be provided to the various risk-related bodies, including the RMC. The policies cover the Bank's main risks, are reviewed regularly to ensure they are still relevant given market changes, regulatory changes and changes in the business plans of the Bank's business units, and they apply to the entire Bank and its subsidiaries, when applicable. Other policies, standards, and procedures complement the main policies and cover more specific aspects of risk management such as business continuity; the launch of new products, initiatives, or activities; or financial instrument measurement.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee  ooff  MMooddeell  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe Bank uses several models to guide enterprise-wide risk management, financial markets strategy, economic and regulatory capital allocation, global credit risk management, wealth management, and profitability measures. The model risk management policies as well as a rigorous model management process ensure that model usage is appropriate and effective.\n\nThe key components of the Bank's model risk management governance framework are as follows: the model risk management policies and standards, the model validation group, and the Models Oversight Committee. The policies and standards set the rules and principles applicable to the development and independent validation of models. The scope of models covered is wide, ranging from market risk pricing models and automated credit decision-making models to the business risk capital models, including models used for regulatory capital and stressed capital purposes, expected credit losses models, and financial-crime models. The framework also includes more advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the Bank's policies is the general principle that all models deemed important for the Bank or used for regulatory capital purposes require heightened lifecycle monitoring and independent validation. All models used by the Bank are therefore classified in terms of risk level (low, medium, or high). Based on this classification, the Bank applies strict guidelines regarding the requirements for model development and documentation, independent review thereof, performance monitoring thereof, and minimum review frequency. The Bank believes that the best defence against 'model risk' is the implementation of a robust development and validation framework.\n\n## I Innddeeppeennddeenntt  OOvveerrssiigghhtt  bbyy  tthhee  CCoommpplliiaannccee  SSeerrvviiccee\n\nCompliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank. Its Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer has direct access to the RMC and to the President and Chief Executive Officer and can communicate directly with officers and directors of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres. The Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer regularly meets with the Chair of the RMC, in the absence of management, to review matters on the relationship between the Compliance Service and the Bank's management and on access to the information required.\n\nBusiness unit managers must oversee the implementation of mechanisms for the daily control of regulatory compliance risks arising from the operations under their responsibility. Compliance exercises independent oversight in order to assist managers in effectively managing these risks and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.\n\n## I Innddeeppeennddeenntt  AAsssseessssmmeenntt  bbyy  IInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiitt\n\nInternal Audit is an independent oversight function created by the Audit Committee.

The Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit, regularly meets with the Chair of the Audit Committee, in the absence of management, to review matters on the relationship between Internal Audit and the Bank's management.\n\nInternal Audit provides reasonable assurance that the main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems are ensuring that, in all material respects, the Bank's key control procedures are effective and compliant. Internal Audit also provides recommendations and advice on how to strengthen these key control procedures. Business unit managers and senior management must ensure the effectiveness of the main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems, and they must implement corrective measures if needed.",

As part of its approach to risk management, the Bank identifies, assesses, reviews and monitors the range of top and emerging risks to which it is exposed in order to proactively manage them and implement appropriate mitigation strategies. Identified top and emerging risks are presented to senior management and communicated to the RMC.\n\nThe Bank applies a risk taxonomy that categorizes, into two groups, the top risks to which the Bank is exposed in the normal course of business:\n\n- \uf0b7 Financial risks: Directly tied to the Bank's key business activities and are generally more quantifiable or predictable;\n- \uf0b7 Non-financial risks: Inherent to the Bank's activities and to which it does not choose to expose itself.\n\nThe Bank separately qualifies the risks to which it is exposed: a 'top risk' is a risk that has been identified, is clearly defined, and could have a significant impact on the Bank's business, results of operations, financial position, and reputation, whereas an 'emerging risk' is a risk that, while it may also have an impact on the Bank, is not yet well understood in terms of its likelihood, consequences, timing, or the magnitude of its potential impact.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank is exposed to the following top risks.\n\nFinancial risks\n\nNon-financial risks\n\nThe Bank is also exposed to other new, so-called emerging or significant risks, which are defined as follows.\n\nR Riisskk  aanndd T Trreenndd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D Deessccrriippttiioonn\n\nGovernment decisions and international relations can have a significant impact on the environment in which the Bank operates. Geopolitical events can lead to volatility, have a negative impact on at-risk assets, and cause financial conditions to deteriorate. They could also directly or indirectly affect banking activities by having repercussions on clients. The war in Ukraine, which has disrupted energy and agricultural supply chains, is a good example. The economic sanctions taken against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and the steps taken by Russia to significantly reduce natural gas supply to Europe have led to soaring energy costs. This situation has triggered the negative economic headwinds now facing Europe and heightened the risk of a political reaction in the form of new governments taking power and social unrest. Even if the war was expected to end relatively quickly, the shattered trust suggests that Europe and Russia will continue to take measures to become less dependant on one another, notably regarding energy matters. While new risks could arise at any time, certain concerns are compelling us to monitor other situations at this time. The geopolitical power struggle that for years has pitted the U.S. against China is one such concern. Businesses, in particular those operating in sectors deemed strategic, run an increasing risk of finding themselves in a maze of contradictory regulations, where complying with U.S. regulations means violating Chinese law, and vice versa. These tensions could also partially undo some of the ties forged between these two superpowers in the financial markets, and Canada might get caught in the crosshairs of the two countries. A recent escalation in tensions between China and the United States on the subject of Taiwan is a new source of disagreement between the two superpowers. While we do not believe an invasion is imminent, China will continue to exert pressure on Taiwan through a combination of unprecedented military exercises and economic sanctions. Taiwan's importance is highlighted by the fact that it is by far the leading global producer of advanced microchips (over 90% of the market share). But the potential for confrontation is not limited to the ChinaU.S. relationship, as protectionism is gaining popularity, and a growing number of countries are implementing measures to both financially support domestic businesses in key sectors (high tech, health care, and food) and to protect them against global competition through business restrictions. The combined effects of supply shortages and geopolitical tensions have shifted the focus from efficiency to supply security. We will continue to monitor all of these developments, analyze any new risks that arise, and assess the impacts that they may have on our organization.\n\nAlthough the economy recovered quickly during the pandemic, a number of risks still remain and others are emerging. Most countries are now dealing with variants, but we are not immune to the emergence of new, more infectious strains that could once again destabilize the economy. For its part, China is going it alone with its zero-COVID policy. Given China's importance to the global economy and supply chain, such a policy, which involves repeated lockdowns, has repercussions not only on growth but also on inflationary pressure. With this in mind, the inflationary outlook remains uncertain insofar as supply chain bottlenecks could stop improving or worse, deteriorate once again.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The sharp rise in inflation in 2022 is presenting another risk, i.e., the risk of spiralling inflation created by higher wages. In fact, the inflationary shock has prompted employees to demand compensation for their lost buying power, which could subsequently compel businesses to raise prices in order to maintain margins, thus creating a vicious cycle. If this scenario of unchecked inflation above central bank targets were to occur, the central banks could move towards a much tighter monetary policy by hiking interest rates even higher. Given that interest rates have remained quite low over the past few years, market participants seeking additional returns may have engaged in excessive risk-taking strategies and would not be immune from negative repercussions should interest rates suddenly spike higher. This would serve as a major headwind for the real estate sector and Canadian households, which have seen their debt levels rise sharply over the past few years. Lastly, climate issues are an added risk in the current context. If too few measures are adopted on the climate front, severe weather events will intensify and result in economic woes over the long term. Conversely, a too-swift transition could result in other risks, particularly short- and medium-term costs and rising pressure on production costs. In short, given the ongoing uncertainties in this environment, the Bank remains vigilant in the face of numerous factors and is continuing to rely on its strong risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate the negative impacts while also remaining within its risk appetite limits.\n\nIn accordance with the TCFD's recommendations, the Bank has identified two types of direct climate-change-related risks (climate risk), i.e., physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts of more frequent and more intense extreme weather events and/or of chronic changes in weather conditions on physical assets, infrastructures, the value chain, productivity, and other physical aspects. Transition risks refer to the potential impacts of moving toward a low-carbon economy (such as technological changes, behavioural changes by consumers, or political or public policy shifts designed to reduce GHG emissions through taxes or incentives) as well as to regulatory changes made to manage and support such an economy. In addition to these two risks are indirect risks, such as the risk of lawsuits, reputation risk, and regulatory compliance risk in an environment that is constantly changing due to ongoing and upcoming initiatives enacted by governments and regulators. Climate risk could have an impact on the traditional risks that are inherent to a financial institution's operations, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, and operational risk, among others.\n\nManaging climate risk has become increasingly important, as evidenced by the interest level in this risk, aligned over a societal, political, and regulatory landscape in constant flux, shown by the Bank's stakeholders, in particular clients, shareholders, governments, and regulators. This past year, several initiatives and public consultations were announced, including OSFI's guideline B-15, Climate Risk Management, the International Sustainability Standards Board's initiative to establish a financial disclosure framework addressing sustainability and climate; and the CSA's proposed National Instrument 51-107 \uf02d Disclosure of Climate-related matters. Other announcements include the Government of Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan and the Government of Quebec's Plan for a Green Economy.\n\nIt is possible that the Bank's or its clients' business models fail to align with a low-carbon economy or that their responses to government strategies and regulatory changes prove inadequate or fail to achieve the target objectives. Another possibility is that events caused by physical risks prove catastrophic (extreme episodes) or that there are adaptability issues (chronic episodes). As such, these risks could result in financial losses for the Bank, affect its business activities and how they are conducted, harm its reputation and increase its regulatory compliance risk, or even affect the activities and financial position of the clients to whom it offers financial services.\n\nThe actual impact of climate risk will depend on future events that are beyond the Bank's control. The Bank must therefore devote special attention to reducing its exposure to these negative outside factors and, at the same time, to seizing new growth opportunities. Its strategies and policies have therefore been designed to consider climate risks while also supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Bank constantly strives to remain apprised of best practices and to support and advise its clients in their move to a lowcarbon economy. From this perspective, we will continue to deliver climate risk management training across the organization, in particular among front-line employees who have direct contact with clients. To better understand and mitigate climate change risks, the Bank also takes part in major national and international financial initiatives, including TCFD, the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking (UNPRB), the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing (UNPRI), and others. However, it cannot predict the effectiveness of government-led climate strategies or of regulatory changes enacted, nor can it assume responsibility for achieving the objectives set out in these strategies and changes.\n\nThe Bank continues to closely monitor developments on this topic and to deploy its climate change risk management framework.\n\nFor additional information, see the Environmental and Social Risk section of this MD&A.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

While this digital transformation meets the growing needs of customers by enhancing the operational efficiency of institutions, it nevertheless comes with information security and cybersecurity risks. The personal information and financial data of financial institution customers are prime targets for criminals. These criminals, who are increasingly well organized and employing ever more sophisticated schemes, try to use technology to steal information.\n\nFaced with a resurgence of cyberthreats and the sophistication of cybercriminals, the Bank is exposed to the risks associated with data breaches, malicious software, unauthorized access, hacking, phishing, identity theft, intellectual property theft, asset theft, industrial espionage, and possible denial of service due to activities causing network failures and service interruptions.\n\nCyberattacks, as with breaches or interruptions of systems that support the Bank and its customers, could cause client attrition; financial loss; an inability of clients to do their banking; non-compliance with privacy legislation or any other current laws; legal disputes; fines; penalties or regulatory action; reputational damage; compliance costs, corrective measures, investigative, or restoration costs; cost hikes to maintain and upgrade technological infrastructures and systems, all of which could affect the Bank's operating results or financial position, in addition to having an impact on its reputation.\n\nIt is also possible for the Bank to be unable to prevent or implement effective preventive measures against every potential cyberthreat, as the tactics used are multiplying, change frequently, come from a wide range of sources, and are increasingly sophisticated.\n\nWithin this context, the Bank works to ensure the integrity and protection of its systems and the information they contain. The Bank reaffirms its commitment to continuous improvement in the area of information security, the ultimate goal being to protect its customers and maintain their trust. Along with its partners in the financial sector and with the regulatory authorities, the Bank is committed to making a sustained effort to mitigate technology risks. Measures specifically directed at anticipating this type of threat include the formation of multidisciplinary teams comprising cybersecurity and fraud prevention specialists. The Bank is also pursuing initiatives under its own cybersecurity program aimed at adapting its protection, surveillance, detection, and response capabilities according to changing threats, the aim being to continue to reduce delays in detecting any anomalies or cybersecurity incidents and limiting the impact thereof as much as possible. A governance and accountability structure has also been established to support decision-making based on sound risk management. The Technology Committee is regularly informed of the cybersecurity posture, of cybersecurity trends and developments, and of lessons learned from operational incidents that have occurred in other large organizations such that it can gain a better understanding of risks, particularly risks related to cybersecurity and the protection of personal information.\n\nRisks related to protecting personal information exist through the entire lifecycle of information and arise, in particular, from inadequate control measures and weak processes. Such risks could also arise from information being improperly created, collected, used, communicated, stored, or destroyed. Greater attention will be paid to the collection, use, and communication of personal information as well as the management and governance applied to such information as the Bank continues to invest in technological solutions and innovations and according to the evolution of its commercial activities.\n\nRisks related to the protection of personal information could cause client attrition; financial loss; non-compliance with legislation; legal disputes; fines; penalties; punitive damages; regulatory action; reputational damage; compliance, remediation, investigative, or restoration costs; cost hikes to maintain and upgrade technological infrastructures and systems, all of which could affect the Bank's operating results or financial position, in addition to having an impact on its reputation.\n\nIn recent years, innovations and the proliferation of technological solutions that collect, use, and communicate personal information such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, automated learning and open banking, have given rise to significant legislative changes in many jurisdictions, including Canada and Quebec. For example, in September 2021, the Quebec government passed An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information, which will gradually come into effect over the next three years. And on June 16, 2022, the federal government tabled Bill C-27 entitled Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022, which aims to enhance and modernize the personal information protection framework.\n\nThe Bank continues to monitor relevant legislative developments and has bolstered its governance structure by updating its policies, standards and practices and by deploying a personal information privacy program that reflects its determination to maintain the trust of its clients.\n\nNational Bank of Canada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In response to those heightened client expectations, to the rapid pace of technological change, and  to the growing presence of new actors in the banking sector, the Bank diligently makes significant and ongoing investments in its  technology while maintaining the operational resilience and robustness of its controls. Inadequate implementation of technological  improvements or new products or services could significantly affect the Bank's ability to serve and retain clients.  Third parties provide essential components of the Bank's technological infrastructure such as Internet connections and access to  network and other communications services.

The transition toward new digital channels and solutions has accelerated greatly following the COVID-19 pandemic, where demand for  digital banking services grew to the detriment of traditional banking services.

Since a large part of the Bank's activities consist of granting loans or providing various liquidity channels to clients, namely, to individuals, businesses in various sectors, and governments, the impacts of the pandemic on these parties could also significantly influence the provisions for credit losses recorded by the Bank. As the pandemic evolves, certain industries and geographic sectors have been facing more persistent consequences thereof. The Bank has therefore continued to closely monitor the situation and, given the considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding the post-pandemic landscape, additional mitigation measures may be needed. The actual impacts will depend on future events that are highly uncertain, including the extent, severity, and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and on the effectiveness of actions and measures taken by governments, monetary authorities, and regulators over the long term.",

        "page_content": "## International Risks\n\nThrough the operations of some of the Bank's units (mainly its New York and London offices) and subsidiaries in Canada and abroad (in particular, Credigy Ltd., NBC Global Finance Limited, and Advanced Bank of Asia Limited), the Bank is exposed to risks arising from its presence in international markets and foreign jurisdictions. While these risks do not affect a significant proportion of the Bank's portfolios, their impact must not be overlooked, especially those that are of a legal or regulatory nature. International risks can be particularly high in territories where the enforceability of agreements signed by the Bank is uncertain, in countries and regions facing political or socio-economic disturbances, or in countries that may be subject to international sanctions. Generally speaking, there are many ways in which the Bank may be exposed to the risks posed by other countries, not the least of which being foreign laws and regulations. In all such situations, it is important to consider what is referred to as 'country risk.' Country risk affects not only the activities that the Bank carries out abroad but also the business that it conducts with non-resident clients as well as the services it provides to clients doing business abroad, such as electronic funds transfers, international products, and transactions made from Canada in foreign currencies.\n\nAs part of its activities, the Bank must adhere to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) regulatory requirements in effect in each jurisdiction where it conducts business. It must also comply with the requirements pertaining to current international sanctions in these various jurisdictions. Money laundering and terrorist financing is a financial, regulatory, and reputation risk. For additional information, see the Regulatory Compliance Risk Management section of this MD&A.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to financial risks outside Canada and the United States, primarily through its interbank transactions on international financial markets or through international trade finance activities. This geographic exposure represents a moderate proportion of the Bank's total risk. The geographic exposure of loans is disclosed in the quarterly Supplementary Financial Information report available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca. To control country risk, the Bank sets credit concentration limits by country and reviews and submits them to the Board for approval upon renewal of the Credit Risk Management Policy. These limits are based on a percentage of the Bank's regulatory capital, in line with the level of risk represented by each country, particularly emerging countries. The risk is rated using a classification mechanism similar to the one used for credit default risk. In addition to the country limits, authorization caps and limits are established, as a percentage of capital, for the world's high-risk regions, i.e., essentially all regions except for North America, Western European countries, and the developed countries of Asia.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Bank's ability to successfully complete an acquisition is often conditional on regulatory approval, and the Bank cannot be certain of the timing or conditions of regulatory decisions. Acquisitions could affect future results should the Bank experience difficulty integrating the acquired business. If the Bank does encounter difficulty integrating an acquired business, maintaining an appropriate governance level over the acquired business, or retaining key officers within the acquired business, these factors could prevent the Bank from realizing expected revenue growth, cost savings, market share gains, and other projected benefits of the acquisition.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Bank protects the intellectual property developed by its employees in connection with their duties. However, in some cases, the Bank's ability to acquire intellectual property rights may be more limited. In addition, the intellectual property rights acquired by the Bank provide no guarantees that they will be effective in deterring or preventing a third party from misappropriating intellectual property or providing a defense against the misappropriation of intellectual property. Moreover, the goods and services developed by the Bank are provided in a competitive market where third parties could hold intellectual property rights prior to those held by the Bank. In such circumstances, there is no guarantee that the Bank will successfully provide a defense against an infringement claim, that it will be able to modify its goods and services to avoid infringing upon third party rights, or that it will obtain a licence with commercially acceptable conditions.\n\n## Judicial and Regulatory Proceedings\n\nThe Bank takes reasonable measures to comply with the laws and regulations in effect in the jurisdictions where it operates. Still, the Bank could be subject to judicial or regulatory decisions resulting in fines, damages, or other costs or to restrictions likely to adversely affect its operating results or its reputation. The Bank may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Although the Bank establishes provisions for the measures it is subject to under accounting requirements, actual losses resulting from such litigation could differ significantly from the recognized amounts, and unfavourable outcomes in such cases could have a significant adverse effect on the Bank's operating results. The resulting reputational damage could also affect the Bank's future business prospects. For additional information, see Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Tax Risk\n\nThe tax laws applicable to the Bank are numerous, complex, and subject to amendment at any time. This complexity can result in differing legal interpretations between the Bank and the respective tax authorities with which it deals. In addition, legislative changes and changes in tax policy, including the interpretation thereof by tax authorities and courts, could affect the Bank's earnings. International and domestic initiatives may also result in changes to tax laws and policies, including international efforts by the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to broaden the tax base and domestic proposals to increase the taxes payable by banks and insurance companies. For additional information on income taxes, see the Income Taxes section on page 52 of this MD&A, the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section on page 110 of this MD&A, and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies, Methods and Estimates Used by the Bank\n\nThe accounting policies and methods used by the Bank determine how the Bank reports its financial position and operating results and require management to make estimates or rely on assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Any changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the Bank's operating results and financial position.\n\n## Additional Factors\n\nOther factors that could affect the Bank's business, operating results, and reputation include unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits; the timely development and launch of new products and services; the ability to successfully align its organizational structure, resources and processes; the ability to activate a business continuity plan within a reasonable time; the potential impact of international conflicts, natural disasters or public health emergencies such as COVID-19; and the Bank's ability to foresee and effectively manage the risks resulting from these factors through rigorous risk management.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of incurring a financial loss if an obligor does not fully honour its contractual commitments to the Bank. Obligors may be debtors, issuers, counterparties, or guarantors. Credit risk is the most significant risk facing the Bank in the normal course of its business. The Bank is exposed to credit risk not only through its direct lending activities and transactions but also through commitments to extend credit and through letters of guarantee, letters of credit, over-the-counter derivatives trading, debt securities, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, deposits with financial institutions, brokerage activities, and transactions carrying a settlement risk for the Bank such as irrevocable fund transfers to third parties via electronic payment systems.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee\n\nA policy framework centralizes the governance of activities that generate credit risk for the Bank and its subsidiaries and is supplemented by a series of subordinate internal policies and standards. These policies and standards address specific management issues such as concentration limits by borrower group and sector, credit limits, collateral requirements, and risk quantification or issues that provide more thorough guidance for given business segments.\n\nFor example, the institutional activities of the Bank and its subsidiaries on financial markets and international commercial transactions are governed by business unit directives that set out standards adapted to the specific environment of these activities. This also applies to retail brokerage subsidiaries. In isolated cases, a business unit or subsidiary may have its own credit policy, and that policy must always fall within the spirit of the Bank's policy framework. Risk Management's leadership team defines the scope of the universe of subsidiaries carrying significant credit risks and the magnitude of the risks incurred.\n\nCredit risk is controlled through a rigorous process that comprises the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 credit risk rating and assessment;\n- \u00b7 economic capital assessment;\n- \u00b7 stress testing;\n- \u00b7 credit granting process;\n- \u00b7 revision and renewal process;\n- \u00b7 risk mitigation;\n- \u00b7 follow-up of monitored accounts and recovery;\n- \u00b7 counterparty risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 settlement risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 environmental risk assessment.\n\n## Concentration Limits\n\nThe Bank sets credit concentration and settlement limits by obligor group, by industry sector, by country, and by region. These limits are subject to the approval of the RMC. Certain types of financing or financing programs are also subject to specific limits. Breaches of concentration limits by obligor group or by region are reported to the RMC each quarter. Furthermore, every industry sector, country, and region whose exposure equals a predetermined percentage of the corresponding authorized limit are reported to the Bank's Risk Management leadership team. At least once a year, the Bank revises these exposures by industry sector, by country, and by region in order to determine the appropriateness of the corresponding concentration limits.",

It presents changes in the credit portfolio and highlights on the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 credit portfolio volume growth by business segment;\n- \u00b7 a breakdown of the credit portfolio according to various criteria for which concentration limits have been set;\n- \u00b7 changes in provisions and allowances for credit losses;\n- \u00b7 changes in impaired loans;\n- \u00b7 follow-up of monitored accounts.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  RRaattiinngg  aanndd  AAsssseessssmmeenntt\n\nBefore a sound and prudent credit decision can be made, an obligor's or counterparty's credit risk must be accurately assessed. This is the first step in processing credit applications. Using a credit rating system developed by the Bank, each application is analyzed and assigned one of 19 grades on a scale of 1 to 10 for all portfolios exposed to credit risk. As each grade corresponds to a debtor's, counterparty's, or third party's probability of default, the Bank can estimate the credit risk. The credit risk assessment method varies according to portfolio type. There are two main methods for assessing credit risk, i.e., the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB) Approach and the Standardized Approach, as defined by the Basel Accord, to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for most of its portfolios.\n\nThe main parameters used to measure the credit risk of loans outstanding and undrawn amounts under the AIRB Approach are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 probability of default (PD), which is the probability of through-the-cycle 12-month default by the obligor, calibrated on a long-run average PD throughout a full economic cycle;\n- \u00b7 loss given default (LGD), which represents the magnitude of the loss from the obligor's default that would be expected in an economic downturn and subject to certain regulatory floors, expressed as a percentage of exposure at default;\n- \u00b7 exposure at default (EAD), which is an estimate of the amount drawn and of the expected use of any undrawn portion prior to default, and cannot be lower than the current balance.\n\nThe methodology as well as the data and the downturn periods used to estimate LGD are described below.\n\n| A AIIRRBB  AAPPPPRROOAACCHH                                                                                                                        | D DAATTAA (1)                                         | D DOOWWNNTTUURRNN  PPEERRIIOODD (1)                                                              | M MEETTHHOODDOOLLOOGGYY  FFOORR  CCAALLCCUULLAATTIINNGG  LLGGDD   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Bank's internal historical data from 1996 to 2021                                                                                              | 1996-1998 and 2008-2009                               | LGD based on the Bank's historical  internal data on recoveries and losses                       | Retail                                                            |\n| The Bank's internal historical data from 2000 to 2021  Benchmarking results using:   \u00b7 Moody's observed default price of bonds,  from 1983 to 2021 | 2000-2003, 2008-2009   and 2020                       | LGD based on the Bank's historical  recoveries and losses internal data and  on Moody's data     | Corporate                                                         |\n| Moody's observed default price of bonds, from  1983 to 2015  S&P rating history from 1975 to 2016                                                  | 1999-2001 and 2008-2012                               | Based on implied market LGD using  observed bond price decreases  following the issuer's default | Sovereign                                                         |\n| Global Credit Data Consortium historical loss and  recovery database from 1991 to 2013                                                             | 1991-1992, 1994, 1997-1998,  2001-2002, and 2008-2009 | Model for predicting LGD based on  different issue- and issuer-related risk  drivers             | Financial institutions                                            |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Personal Credit Portfolios\n\nThis category comprises portfolios of residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and loans to certain small businesses. To assess credit risk, AIRB models are in place for the main portfolios, particularly mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, budget loans, lines of credit, and SME retail. A risk analysis based on loan grouping in pools of homogeneous obligor and product profiles is used for overall management of personal credit portfolios. This personal credit assessment approach, which has proven particularly effective for estimating credit defaults and losses, takes a number of factors into account, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 Attributes from credit rating agencies (scoring) related to behaviour;\n- \u00b7 loan product characteristics;\n- \u00b7 collateral provided;\n- \u00b7 the length of time on the Bank's balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 loan status (active, delinquent, or defaulted).\n\nThis mechanism provides adequate risk measurement inasmuch as it effectively differentiates risk levels by pool. Therefore, the results are periodically reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made to the models. Obligor migrations between pools are among the factors considered when assessing credit risk.\n\nLoan pools are also established based on PD, LGD, and EAD, which are measured based on the characteristics of the obligor and the transaction itself. The credit risk of these portfolios is estimated using credit scoring models that determine the obligor's PD. LGD is estimated based on transaction-specific factors such as loan product characteristics (for example, a line of credit versus a term loan), loan-to-value ratio, and types of collateral.\n\nCredit scoring models are also used to grant credit. These models use proven statistical methods that measure an obligor's demand characteristics and history based on internal and external historical information to estimate the obligor's future credit behaviour and assign a probability of default. The underlying data include obligor information such as current and past employment, historical loan data in the Bank's management systems, and information from external sources such as credit rating agencies.\n\nThe Bank also uses behaviour scoring models to manage and monitor current commitments. The risk assessment is based on statistical analyses of the past behaviour of obligors with which the Bank has a long-term relationship in an effort to predict their future behaviour. The underlying information includes the obligor's cash flows and borrowing trends. Information on characteristics that determine behaviour in these models also comes from both internal sources on current commitments and external sources. The table on the following page presents the PD categories and credit quality of the associated personal credit portfolio.\n\n## Mortgage Loan Underwriting\n\nTo mitigate the impact of an economic slowdown and ensure the long-term quality of its portfolio, the Bank uses sound risk management when granting residential mortgages to confirm: (i) the obligor's intention to meet its financial obligations, (ii) the obligor's ability to repay its debts, and (iii) the quality of the collateral. In addition, in accordance with the applicable rules, the Bank takes a prudent approach to client qualification by using, for example, a higher interest rate to mitigate the risk of short- or medium-term rate hikes.\n\nNonetheless, the risk of economic slowdown could adversely affect the profitability of the mortgage portfolio. In stress test analyses, the Bank considers a variety of scenarios to measure the impact of adverse market conditions. In such circumstances, our analyses show significantly higher credit losses, which would decrease profitability and reduce the Bank's capital ratios.\n\n## New Regulatory Developments\n\nOn December 17, 2021, OSFI confirmed the qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages (i.e., residential mortgages with a down payment of 20% or more) will remain as the greater of the mortgage contract interest rate plus 2% and a minimum floor of 5.25%. OSFI is well aware that the country's post-pandemic economic recovery must be backed by a strong financial system capable of supporting the Canadian population in the current environment and that real estate market conditions in Canada could heighten the financial risk weighing on lenders. The minimum qualifying interest rate provides an additional level of safety to ensure that borrowers would have the ability to make mortgage payments should circumstances change, e.g., in the case of reduced income or a rise in interest rates.\n\nOn June 28, 2022, OSFI published an Advisory entitled Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products Under Guideline B-20. The Advisory complements the existing expectations set out in Guideline B-20 - Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures. The Advisory specifies OSFI's expectations concerning underwriting practices and procedures for reverse residential mortgages, residential mortgages with shared equity features, and combined loan plans (CLPs), notably for CLPs and the re-advanceability of credit above the 65% loan-to-value (LTV) limit. For loans that exceed the 65% LTV limit, there will be a transition period where a portion of the principal payments will go towards repaying the overall mortgage amount until it is below 65% of the original LTV ratio and not re-advanceable. The implementation date for this change is October 31, 2023.",

        "page_content": "On August 1, 2022, Quebec's consumer protection organization, the Office de la protection du consommateur, increased the monthly minimum payment percentage to 3.5% of the balance for credit cardholders in Quebec whose contract was issued before August 1, 2019. Annual increases of 0.5% until 2025 are planned in order to raise the monthly minimum payment percentage to the 5% minimum currently applicable to contracts issued in Quebec after August 1, 2019. The purpose of these measures is to help households avoid debt issues and to reduce the risk of loss among lenders.\n\nThe objective of Bill 53 is to tighten the regulatory framework governing credit assessment agents and ensure that Quebec consumers can access protection measures, including security freezes of their credit files, which would limit access to lenders for credit authorization purposes. This measure is expected to come into force on February 1, 2023.\n\n## Business and Government Credit Portfolios\n\nThis category comprises business (other than some small businesses that are classified in personal credit portfolios), government, and financial institution credit portfolios.\n\nThese credit portfolios are assigned a risk rating that is based on a detailed individual analysis of the financial and non-financial aspects of the obligor, including the obligor's financial strength, sector of economic activity, competitive ability, access to capital management quality, and number of years in business. The Bank uses risk-rating tools and models to specifically assess the risk represented by an obligor in relation to its industry and peers. The models used are adapted to the obligor's broad sector of activity. Models are in place for ten sectors: business/commercial, large business, financial institutions, sovereigns, investment funds, energy, real estate, agriculture, insurance, and public-private partnership project financing.\n\nThis risk assessment method assigns a default risk rating to an obligor that reflects its credit quality. To each default credit risk rating corresponds a PD (see the table below). Using this classification of obligor credit risk, the Bank can differentiate appropriately between the various assessments of an obligor's capacity to meet its contractual obligations. Default risk ratings are assigned according to an assessment of an obligor's commercial and financial risks based on a solvency review. Various risk quantification models, described below, are used to perform this assessment.\n\nThe business and government default risk rating scale used by the Bank is similar to the systems used by major external rating agencies. The following table presents a grouping of the ratings by major risk category and compares them with the ratings of two major rating agencies.\n\n## I Inntteerrnnaall  DDeeffaauulltt  RRiisskk  RRaattiinnggss**\n\n| Description (1)   |                 | Personal credit  portfolios   | Personal credit  portfolios           | Personal credit  portfolios   | Personal credit  portfolios   | Business and government   credit portfolios   |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                   |                 | PD (%) -                      | PD (%) -                              | PD (%) -                      | PD (%) -                      |                                               |\n|                   | PD (%) - Retail | Ratings                       | Corporate and  financial institutions | PD (%) -  Sovereign           | Standard  & Poor's            | Moody's                                       |\n| Excellent         | 0.000-0.144     | 1-2.5                         | 0.000-0.112                           | 0.000-0.060                   | AAA to A-                     | Aaa to A3                                     |\n| Good              | 0.145-0.506     | 3-4                           | 0.112-0.384                           | 0.060-0.331                   | BBB+ to BBB-                  | Baa1 to Baa3                                  |\n| Satisfactory      | 0.507-2.681     | 4.5-6.5                       | 0.384-4.235                           | 0.331-5.738                   | BB+ to B                      | Ba1 to B2                                     |\n| Special mention   | 2.682-9.348     | 7-7.5                         | 4.235-10.182                          | 5.738-17.964                  | B- to CCC+                    | B3 to Caa1                                    |\n| Substandard       | 9.349-9.999     | 8-8.5                         | 10.182-99.999                         | 17.964-99.999                 | CCC & CCC-                    | Caa2 & Caa3                                   |\n| Default           | 1               | 9-10                          | 100                                   | 100                           | CC, C & D                     | Ca, C & D                                     |\n\nThe Bank also uses individual assessment models by industry to assign a risk rating to the credit facility based on the collateral that the obligor is able to provide and, in some cases, based on other factors. The Bank consequently has a bi-dimensional risk-rating system that, using models and internal and external historical data, establishes a default risk rating for each obligor. In addition, the models assign, to each credit facility, an LGD risk rating that is independent of the default risk rating assigned to the obligor.\n\nThe Bank's default risk ratings and LGD risk ratings as well as the related risk parameters contribute directly to informed credit-granting, renewal, and monitoring decisions. They are also used to determine and analyze risk-based pricing. In addition, from a credit portfolio management perspective, they are used to establish counterparty credit concentration limits and segment concentration limits as well as limits to decision-making power and to determine the credit risk appetite of these portfolios. Moreover, they represent an important component in estimating expected and unexpected losses, measuring minimum required economic capital, and measuring the minimum level of capital required, as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.\n\nThe credit risk of obligors and of their facilities is assessed with the PD and LGD parameters at least once a year or more often if significant changes (triggers) are observed when updating financial information or if another qualitative indicator of a deterioration in the obligor's solvency or in the collateral associated with the obligor's facilities is noted. The Bank also uses a watchlist to more actively monitor the financial position of obligors whose default-risk rating is greater than or equal to 7.0. This process seeks to minimize an obligor's default risk and allows for proactive credit risk management.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Backtesting is performed at regular intervals to validate the effectiveness of the models used to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. For PD in particular, this backtesting takes the form of sequentially applied measures designed to assess the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the model's discriminatory power;\n- \u00b7 the proportion of overrides;\n- \u00b7 model calibration;\n- \u00b7 the stability of the model's inputs and outputs.\n\nThe credit risk quantification models are developed and tested by a team of specialists with model performance being monitored by the applicable business units and related credit risk management services. Models are validated by a unit that is independent of both the specialists who developed the model and the concerned business units. Approvals of new models or changes to existing models are subject to an escalation process established by the model risk management policy. Furthermore, new models or changes to existing models that markedly impact regulatory capital must be approved by the Board before being submitted to the regulatory agencies.\n\nThe facility and default risk-rating systems, methods, and models are also subject to periodic independent validation, the frequency of which depends on the model's risk level. Models that have a significant impact on regulatory capital must be reviewed regularly, thereby further raising the certainty that these quantification mechanisms are working as expected.\n\nThe key aspects to be validated are risk factors allowing for accurate classification of default risk by level, adequate quantification of exposure, use of assessment techniques that consider external factors such as economic conditions and credit status and, lastly, compliance with internal policies and regulatory provisions.\n\nThe Bank's credit risk assessment and rating systems are overseen by the Models Oversight Committee, the GRC, and the RMC, and these systems constitute an integral part of a comprehensive Bank-wide credit risk oversight framework. Along with the above-mentioned elements, the Bank documents and periodically reviews the policies, definitions of responsibilities, resource allocation, and existing processes.\n\n## AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  EEccoonnoommiicc  CCaappiittaall\n\nThe assessment of the Bank's minimum required economic capital is based on the credit risk assessments of obligors. These two activities are therefore interlinked. The different models used to assess the credit risk of a given portfolio type also enable the Bank to determine the default correlation among obligors. This information is a critical component in the evaluation of potential losses for all portfolios carrying credit risk. Estimates of potential losses, whether expected or not, are based on historical loss experience, portfolio monitoring, market data, and statistical modelling. Expected and unexpected losses are factors used in assessing the minimum required economic capital for all of the Bank's credit portfolios. The assessment of economic capital also considers the anticipated potential migrations of the default risk ratings of obligors during the remaining term of their credit commitments. The main risk factors that have an impact on economic capital are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the obligor's PD;\n- \u00b7 the obligor's EAD;\n- \u00b7 the obligor's LGD;\n- \u00b7 the default correlation among various obligors;\n- \u00b7 the residual term of credit commitments;\n- \u00b7 the impact of economic and sector-based cycles on asset quality.\n\n## SSttrreessss  TTeessttiinngg\n\nThe Bank carries out stress tests to evaluate its sensitivity to crisis situations in certain activity sectors and key portfolios. A global stress test methodology covers most business, government, and personal credit portfolios to provide the Bank with an overview of the situation. By simulating specific scenarios, these tests enable the Bank to measure allowances for credit losses according to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), to assess the level of regulatory capital needed to absorb potential losses, and to determine the impact on its solvency. In addition, these tests contribute to portfolio management as they influence the determination of concentration limits by obligor, product, or business sector.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt--GGrraannttiinngg  PPrroocceessss\n\nCredit-granting decisions are based first and foremost on the results of the risk assessment. Aside from an obligor's solvency, credit-granting decisions are also influenced by factors such as available collateral and guarantees, transaction compliance with policies, standards and procedures, and the Bank's overall risk-adjusted return objective. Each credit-granting decision is made by authorities within the risk management teams and management, who are independent of the business units and are at a reporting level commensurate with the size of the proposed credit transaction and the associated risk. Decision-making authority is determined in compliance with the delegation of authority set out in the Credit Risk Management Policy. A person in a senior position in the organization approves credit facilities that are substantial or carry a higher risk for the Bank. The GRC approves and monitors all substantial credit facilities. Credit applications that exceed management's latitudes are submitted to the Board for approval. The credit-granting process demands a high level of accountability from managers, who must proactively manage the credit portfolio.",

The review process enables the Bank to update information on the quality of the facilities and covers, among other things, risk ratings, compliance with credit conditions, and obligor behaviour. In the specific case of business credit portfolios, the credit risk of all obligors is reviewed at least once per year. After this periodic review, for on-demand or unused credit, the Bank decides whether to pursue its business relationship with the obligor and, if so, revises the credit conditions. For personal credit portfolios, the credit risk of all obligors is reviewed on a continual basis.\n\n## R Riisskk  MMiittiiggaattiioonn\n\nThe Bank also controls credit risk using various risk mitigation techniques. In addition to the standard practice of requiring collateral to guarantee repayment of the credit it grants, the Bank also uses protection mechanisms such as credit derivative financial instruments, syndication, and loan assignments as well as an orderly reduction in the amount of credit granted.\n\nThe most common method used to mitigate credit risk is obtaining quality collateral from obligors. Obtaining collateral cannot replace a rigorous assessment of an obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations, but, beyond a certain risk threshold, it is an essential complement. The obtaining of collateral depends on the level of risk presented by the obligor and the type of loan granted. The legal validity and enforceability of any collateral obtained and the Bank's ability to regularly and correctly measure the collateral's value are critical for this mechanism to play its proper role in risk mitigation.\n\nIn its internal policies and standards, the Bank has established specific requirements regarding the appropriate legal documentation and assessment for the kinds of collateral that business units may require to guarantee the loans granted. The categories of eligible collateral and the lending value of the collateralized assets have also been defined by the Bank. For the most part, they include the following asset categories as well as guarantees (whether secured by collateral or unsecured) and government and bank guarantees:\n\n- \u00b7 accounts receivable;\n- \u00b7 inventories;\n- \u00b7 machinery and equipment and rolling stock;\n- \u00b7 residential and commercial real estate, office buildings and industrial facilities;\n- \u00b7 cash and marketable securities.\n\n## Portfolio Diversification and Management\n\nThe Bank is exposed to credit risk, not only through outstanding loans and undrawn amounts of commitments to a particular obligor but also through the sectoral distribution of the outstanding loans and undrawn amounts and through the exposure of its various credit portfolios to geographical, concentration, and settlement risks.\n\nThe Bank's approach to controlling these diverse risks begins with a diversification of exposures. Measures designed to maintain a healthy degree of credit risk diversification in its portfolios are set out in the Bank's policies, standards, and procedures. These instructions are mainly reflected in the application of various exposure limits: credit concentration limits by counterparty and credit concentration limits by business sector, country, region, product, and type of financial instrument. These limits are determined based on the Bank's credit risk appetite framework and are reviewed periodically. Compliance with these limits, particularly exceptions, is monitored through periodic reports submitted by the Risk Management Group's officers to the Board.\n\nContinuous analyses are performed in order to anticipate problems with a sector or obligor before they materialize, notably as defaulted payments.\n\n## Other Risk Mitigation Methods\n\nCredit risk mitigation measures for transactions in derivative financial instruments, which are regularly used by the Bank, are described in detail in the Counterparty Risk section.\n\n## Credit Derivative Financial Instruments and Financial Guarantee Contracts\n\nThe Bank also reduces credit risk by using the protection provided by credit derivative financial instruments such as credit default swaps. When the Bank acquires credit protection, it pays a premium on the swap to the counterparty in exchange for the counterparty's commitment to pay if the underlying entity defaults or another event involving the counterparty and covered by the legal agreement occurs. Since, like obligors, providers of credit protection must receive a default risk rating, the Bank's standards set out all the criteria under which a counterparty may be judged eligible to mitigate the Bank's credit risk. The Bank may also reduce its credit risk by entering into financial guarantee contracts whereby a guarantor indemnifies the Bank for a loss resulting from an obligor failing to make a payment when due in accordance with the contractual terms of a debt instrument.\n\n## Loan Syndication\n\nThe Bank has developed specific instructions on the appropriate objectives, responsibilities, and documentation requirements for loan syndication.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Loan portfolio managers use an array of intervention methods to conduct a particularly rigorous follow-up on files that show a high risk of default, and they submit comments to credit risk management groups about each identified borrower on the watchlist for whom they are responsible. When loans continue to deteriorate and there is an increase in risk to the point where monitoring has to be increased, a group specialized in managing problem accounts (Work Out units) steps in to maximize collection of the disbursed amounts and tailor strategies to these accounts.\n\nEach quarter, the Work Out units submit a monitoring report (called a watchlist) to a monitoring committee that tracks the status of at-risk obligors and the corrective measures undertaken. In addition, files in which the authorized amount is $5 million and up are presented to the Watchlist Committee, which in turn reviews the action plans and watchlist reports. The authority to approve allowances for credit losses is attributed using limits delegated on the basis of hierarchical level presented in the Credit Risk Management Policy.\n\nInformation on the recognition of impaired loans and allowances for credit losses is presented in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Forbearance and Restructuring\n\nSituations where a business or retail obligor begins showing clear signs of potential insolvency are managed on a case-by-case basis and require the use of judgment. The Loan Work Out Policy sets out the principles applicable in such situations to guide loan restructuring decisions and identify situations where distressed restructuring applies. A distressed restructuring situation occurs when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the obligor's financial difficulties, grants the obligor a special concession that is contrary to the Bank's policies. Such concessions could include a lower interest rate, waiver of principal, and extension of the maturity date.\n\nThe Bank has established a management framework for commercial and corporate obligors that represent higher-than-normal risk of default. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of loan portfolio managers with respect to managing high-risk accounts and the responsibilities of the Work Out units and other participants in the process. Lastly, the Credit Risk Management Policy and a management framework are used to determine the authorization limits for distressed restructuring situations. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the amount of distressed loan restructurings was not significant.\n\n## C Coouunntteerrppaarrttyy  RRiisskk  AAsssseessssmmeenntt\n\nCounterparty risk is a credit risk that the Bank incurs on various types of transactions involving financial instruments. The most significant risks are those it faces when it trades derivative financial instruments with counterparties on the over-the-counter market or when it purchases securities under reverse repurchase agreements or sells securities under repurchase agreements. Securities lending transactions and securities brokerage activities involving derivative financial instruments are also sources of counterparty risk. Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides a complete description of the credit risk for derivative financial instruments by type of traded product.\n\nThe Risk Management Group has developed models by type of counterparty through which it applies an advanced methodology for calculating the Bank's credit risk exposure and economic capital. The exposures are subject to limits. These limits are established based on the counterparty's internal default risk rating and on the potential volatility of the underlying assets until expiration of the contract.\n\nCounterparty obligations related to the trading of contracts on derivative financial instruments, securities lending transactions, and reverse repurchase agreements are frequently subject to credit risk mitigation measures. The mitigation techniques are somewhat different from those used for loans and advances and depend on the nature of the instrument or the type of contract traded. The most widely used measure is the signing of master agreements: the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master agreement, the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), and the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement (GMSLA). These agreements make it possible, in the event of default, insolvency, or bankruptcy of one of the contracting parties, to apply full netting of the gross amounts of the market values for each of the transactions covered by the agreement in force at the time of default. The amount of the final settlement is therefore the net balance of gains and losses on each transaction, which reduces exposure when a counterparty defaults. The Bank's policies require that an ISDA, GMRA, or GMSLA agreement be signed with its trading counterparties to derivatives, foreign exchange forward contracts, securities lending transactions, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nAnother mechanism for reducing credit risk on derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts complements the ISDA master agreement in many cases and provides the Bank and its counterparty (or either of the parties, if need be) with the right to request collateral from the counterparty when the net balance of gains and losses on each transaction exceeds a threshold defined in the agreement. These agreements, also known as Credit Support Annexes (CSA), are mandatory when financial institutions trade between each other in international financial markets since they limit credit risk while providing traders with additional flexibility to continue negotiating with the counterparty. When required by regulation, the Bank always uses this type of legal documentation in transactions with financial institutions and governments. For business transactions, the Bank prefers to use internal mechanisms, notably involving collateral and mortgages, set out in the credit agreements. The Bank's internal policies set the conditions governing the implementation of such mitigation methods.",

        "page_content": "Requiring collateral as part of a securities lending transaction or reverse repurchase agreement is not solely the result of an internal credit decision. In fact, it is a mandatory market practice imposed by self-regulating organizations in the financial services sector such as the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC).\n\nThe Bank has identified circumstances in which it is likely to be exposed to wrong-way risk. There are two types of wrong-way risk: general wrong-way risk and specific wrong-way risk. General wrong-way risk occurs when the probability of default of the counterparties is positively correlated to general market risk factors. Specific wrong-way risk occurs when the exposure to a specific counterparty is positively correlated to the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with this counterparty.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSeettttlleemmeenntt  RRiisskk\n\nSettlement risk potentially arises from transactions that feature reciprocal delivery of cash or securities between the Bank and a counterparty. Foreign exchange contracts are an example of transactions that can generate significant levels of settlement risk. However, the implementation of multilateral settlement systems that allow settlement netting among participating institutions has contributed greatly to reducing the risks associated with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions among banks. The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to gain access to established clearing houses in order to minimize settlement risk for certain financial derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank may have direct access to established clearing houses for settling financial transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. In addition, certain derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties. For additional information, see the table that presents notional amounts in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are several other types of transactions that may generate settlement risk, in particular the use of certain electronic fund transfer services. This risk refers to the possibility that the Bank may make a payment or settlement on a transaction without receiving the amount owed by the counterparty, and with no opportunity to recover the funds delivered (irrevocable settlement).\n\nThe ultimate means for completely eliminating such a risk is for the Bank to complete no payments or settlements before receiving the funds due from the counterparty. Such an approach cannot, however, be used systematically. For several electronic payment services, the Bank is able to implement mechanisms that allow it to make its transfers revocable or to debit the counterparty in the amount of the settlements before it makes its own transfer. On the other hand, the nature of transactions in financial instruments makes it impossible for such practices to be widely used. For example, on foreign exchange transactions involving a currency other than the U.S. dollar, time zone differentials impose strict payment schedules on the parties. The Bank cannot unduly postpone a settlement without facing penalties, due to the large size of the amounts involved.\n\nThe most effective way for the Bank to control settlement risks, both for financial market transactions and irrevocable transfers, is to impose internal risk limits based on the counterparty's ability to pay.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttaall  RRiisskk\n\nEnvironmental risk can affect credit risk in that the energy transition movement and extreme weather events could result in a decreased ability to make repayments or in a decrease in the value of assets pledged as collateral. Ultimately, environmental risk can lead to both a higher probability of default and higher loss given default among counterparties. In response, the risk management framework has been expanded to include new measures that identify, assess, control, and monitor environmental risk. In addition, the Bank has developed and is gradually deploying a process used to assess and quantify the impacts of climate changes on its strategy and results. Furthermore, for clients in specific industries, the impacts of climate changes are discussed at least once a year as part of the credit granting or renewal process.\n\nThe Bank also assesses its exposure to environment-related credit risk using a variety of control and monitoring mechanisms. For example, analyses are performed on vulnerabilities to physical risks and on loan portfolio transition risks. These analyses are applied to all financing activities and provide greater visibility of the Bank's exposure to environmental risk. In addition, the Bank periodically assesses loan portfolio concentration risk to ensure that such risk is not being significantly affected by environmental risk. Furthermore, an industry sector matrix has been developed to provide the Risk Management Group with a clearer vision of the loan portfolio sectors that are most affected by climate-related risks. Thanks to these initiatives, the Bank can take concrete steps in the process used to review sectoral limits, as each business sector or industry now has an ESG section describing its environmental risk. As well, to help the Bank achieve its business objectives, the Risk Management Group created the position of Vice-President, Credit Analytics and Climate Risk, whose responsibilities consist of increasing the Bank's ability to extract business intelligence, to integrate climate risk into its decision-making processes, and to develop its climate risk analysis capacities. Regarding this latter point, the Bank has begun climate risk impact analyses using the climate scenarios recommended by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).\n\nThis year also saw the emergence of a new environmental risk issue, i.e., the potential financial repercussions of climate change on biodiversity. Financial system participants were called upon by the PRB Biodiversity Community initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), of which the Bank is a member. Similarly, as part of a Fondaction initiative the Bank took part in a one-day brainstorming exercise on biodiversity indicators for investors. As this environmental risk issue begins to emerge, the Bank will continue to closely monitor the various initiatives and contribute to deliberations about potentially incorporating this issue into both investment and credit-granting decisions. The Risk Management Group closely monitors changes in trends and calculation methods and actively participates in various industry discussion groups.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Market risk comes from a number of factors, particularly changes to market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and implied volatilities. The Bank is exposed to market risk through its participation in trading, investment, and asset/liability management activities. Trading activities involve taking positions on various instruments such as bonds, shares, currencies, commodities, or derivative financial instruments. The Bank is exposed to non-trading market risk through its asset/liability management and investment portfolios.\n\nThe trading portfolios include positions in financial instruments and commodities held either with trading intent or to hedge other elements of the trading book. Positions held with trading intent are those held for short-term resale and/or with the intent of taking advantage of actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. These portfolios target one of the following objectives: market making, liquidating positions for clients, or selling financial products to clients.\n\nNon-trading portfolios include financial instruments intended to be held to maturity as well as those held for daily cash management or for the purpose of maintaining targeted returns or ensuring asset and liability management.\n\n## GGoovveerrnnaannccee\n\nA market risk management policy governs global market risk management across the Bank's units and subsidiaries that are exposed to this type of risk. It is approved by the GRC. The policy sets out the principles for managing market risk and the framework that defines risk measures, control and monitoring activities; sets market risk limits; and reports on breaches.\n\nThe Financial Markets Risk Committee oversees all Financial Markets segment risks that could adversely affect the Bank's results, liquidity, or capital. This committee also oversees the Financial Markets segment's risk framework to ensure that controls are in place to contain risk in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite framework.\n\nMarket risk limits ensure the link and coherence between the Bank's market risk appetite targets and the day-to-day market risk management by all parties involved, notably senior management, the business units, and the market risk sector in its independent control function. The Bank's monitoring and reporting process consists of comparing market risk exposure to alert levels and to the market risk limits established for all limit authorization and approval levels.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk\n\nThe Risk Management Group uses a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses under more or less severe scenarios, and using both shortterm and long-term time horizons. For short-term horizons, the Bank's risk measures include Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR), and sensitivity metrics. For long-term horizons or sudden significant market moves, including those due to a lack of market liquidity, the risk measures include stress testing across an extensive range of scenarios.\n\n## VaR and SVaR Models\n\nVaR is a statistical measure of risk that is used to quantify market risks by activity and by risk type. VaR is defined as the maximum loss at a specific confidence level over a certain horizon under normal market conditions. The VaR method has the advantage of providing a uniform measurement of financial-instrumentrelated market risks based on a single statistical confidence level and time horizon.\n\nFor VaR, the Bank uses a historical price distribution to compute the probable loss levels at a 99% confidence level, using a two-year history of daily time series of risk factor changes. VaR is the maximum daily loss that the Bank could incur, in 99 out of 100 cases, in a given portfolio. In other words, the loss could exceed that amount in only one out of 100 cases.\n\nThe trading VaR is measured by assuming a holding period of one day for ongoing market risk management and a 10-day holding period for regulatory capital purposes. VaR is calculated on a daily basis both for major classes of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) and for all trading portfolios in the Financial Markets segment and the Bank's Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nIn addition to the one-day trading VaR, the Bank calculates a trading SVaR, which is a statistical measure of risk that replicates the VaR calculation method but uses, instead of a two-year history of risk factor changes, a 12-month data period corresponding to a continuous period of significant financial stress that is relevant in terms of the Bank's portfolios.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "VaR methodology techniques are well suited to measuring risks under normal market conditions. VaR metrics are most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets. However, there are limitations in measuring risks with this method when extreme and sudden market risk events occur, since they are likely to underestimate the Bank's market risk. VaR methodology limitations include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 past changes in market risk factors may not always produce accurate predictions of the distribution and correlations of future market movements;\n- \uf0b7 a VaR with a daily time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day;\n- \uf0b7 the market risk factor historical database used for VaR calculation may not reflect potential losses that could occur under unusual market conditions (e.g., periods of extreme illiquidity) relative to the historical period used for VaR estimates;\n- \uf0b7 the use of a 99% VaR confidence level does not reflect the extent of potential losses beyond that percentile.\n\nGiven the limitations of VaR, this measure represents only one component of the Bank's risk management oversight, which also incorporates, among other measures, stress testing, sensitivity analysis, and concentration and liquidity limits and analysis.\n\nThe Bank also conducts backtesting of the VaR model. It consists of comparing the profits and losses to the statistical VaR measure. Backtesting is essential to verifying the VaR model's capacity to adequately forecast the maximum risk of market losses and thus validate, retroactively, the quality and accuracy of the results obtained using the model. If the backtesting results present material discrepancies, the VaR model could be revised in accordance with the Bank's model risk management framework. All market risk models and their performance are subject to periodic independent validation by the model validation group.\n\n## CCoonnttrroolllliinngg  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk\n\nA comprehensive set of limits is applied to market risk measures, and these limits are monitored and reported on a regular basis. Instances when limits are exceeded are reported to the appropriate management level. The risk profiles of the Bank's operations remain consistent with its risk appetite and the resulting limits, and are monitored and reported to traders, management of the applicable business unit, senior executives, and Board committees.\n\nThe Bank also uses economic capital for market risk as an indicator for risk appetite and limit setting. This indicator measures the amount of capital that is required to absorb unexpected losses due to market risk events over a one-year horizon and with a determined confidence level. For additional information on economic capital, see the Capital Management section of this MD&A.",

This technique enhances transparency by exploring a range of severe but plausible scenarios.\n\nThese stress tests simulate the results that the portfolios would generate if the extreme scenarios in question were to occur. The Bank's stress testing framework, which is applied to all positions generating market risk, currently comprises the following categories of stress test scenarios:\n\n- \uf0b7 Historical scenarios based on past major disruption situations;\n- \uf0b7 Hypothetical scenarios designed to be forward-looking in the face of potential market stresses;\n- \uf0b7 Scenarios specific to asset classes, including:\n- o sharp parallel increases/decreases in interest rates; non-parallel movements of interest rates (flattening and steepening) and increases/decreases in credit spreads;\n- o sharp stock market crash coupled with a significant increase in volatility of the term structure; increase in stock prices combined with less volatility;\n- o significant increases/decreases in commodity prices coupled with increases/decreases in volatility; short-term and long-term increases/decreases in commodity prices;\n- o depreciation/appreciation of the U.S. dollar and of other currencies relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  IInntteerreesstt  RRaattee  RRiisskk\n\nAs part of its core banking activities, such as lending and deposit taking, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the potential negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Bank's annual net interest income and the economic value of its equity. Activities related to hedging, investments, and term funding are also exposed to structural interest rate risk. The Bank's main exposure to interest rate risk stems from a variety of sources:\n\n- \uf0b7 yield curve risk, which refers to changes in the level, slope, and shape of the yield curve;\n- \uf0b7 repricing risk, which arises from timing differences in the maturity and repricing of on- and off-balance-sheet items;\n- \uf0b7 options risk, either implicit (e.g., prepayment of mortgage loans) or explicit (e.g., capped mortgages and rate guarantees) in balance sheet products;\n- \uf0b7 basis risk that is caused by imperfect correlation between different yield curves.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to structural interest rate risk is assessed and controlled mostly through the impact of stress scenarios and market shocks on the economic value of the Bank's equity and on 12-month net interest income projections. These metrics are based on cash flow projections prepared using a number of assumptions. Specifically, the Bank has developed key assumptions on loan prepayment levels, deposit redemptions, and the behaviour of customers that were granted rate guarantees. These specific assumptions were developed based on historical analyses and are reviewed frequently.\n\nFunds transfer pricing is a process by which the Bank's business units are charged or paid according to their use or supply of funding. Through this mechanism, all funding activities as well as the interest rate risk and liquidity risk associated with those activities are centralized in the Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nActive management of structural interest rate risk can significantly enhance the Bank's profitability and add to shareholder value. The Bank's goal is to maximize the economic value of its equity and its annual net interest income considering its risk appetite. This goal must be achieved within prescribed risk limits and is accomplished primarily by implementing a policy framework, approved by the GRC and submitted for information purposes to the RMC, that sets a risk tolerance threshold, monitoring structures controlled by the various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities, and segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding plan that includes the expected growth of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Governance\n\nManagement of the Bank's structural interest rate risk is mandated to the Global Funding and Treasury Group. In this role, the executives and personnel of this group are responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks inherent to structural interest rate risk hedging decisions and operations. They act as the primary effective challenge function with respect to the execution of these activities. The GRC approves and endorses the structural interest rate exposure and strategies on the recommendation of the Global Funding and Treasury Group. The Risk Management Group is responsible for assessing structural interest rate risk, monitoring activities, and ensuring compliance with the interest rate risk in the banking book policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that an appropriate risk management framework is in place and ensures compliance with the risk appetite framework and policy. Structural interest rate risk supervision is mainly provided by the Financial Markets Risk Committee. This committee reviews exposure to structural interest rate risk, the use of limits, and changes made to assumptions.",

Stress test scenarios are performed where the yield curve level, slope, and shape are shocked. Yield curve basis and volatility scenarios are also performed. All risk factors mentioned above are covered by specific scenarios and have Board-approved or GRC-approved risk limits.\n\nDynamic simulation is also used to project the Bank's future net interest income, future economic value, and future exposure to structural interest rate risk. These simulations project cash flows of assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet products over a given investment horizon. Given their dynamic nature, they encompass assumptions pertaining to changes in volume, client term preference, prepayments of deposits and loans, and the yield curve.\n\nThe following table presents the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100-basis-point increase or of an immediate and sustained 100 basis-point decrease in interest rates on the economic value of equity and on the net interest income of the Bank's non-trading portfolios for the next 12 months, assuming no further hedging is undertaken.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  RRaattee  SSeennssiittiivviittyy  --  NNoonn--TTrraaddiinngg  AAccttiivviittiieess  ((BBeeffoorree  TTaaxx))**\n\nAs at October 31\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                              | 2 2002222                         | 2 2002222                           | 2 2002222   | 2021             | 2021              | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|\n|                                                             | C Caannaaddiiaann   d doollllaarr | O Otthheerr   c cuurrrreenncciieess | T Toottaall | Canadian  dollar | Other  currencies | Total  |\n| I Immppaacctt  oonn  eeqquuiittyy                           |                                   |                                     |             |                  |                   |        |\n| 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate               | ( (119911))                       | ( (2244))                           | ( (221155)) | (277)            | 39                | (238)  |\n| 100-basis-point decrease in the interest rate               | 1 17799                           | 2 277                               | 2 20066     | 253              | (34)              | 219    |\n| I Immppaacctt  oonn  nneett  iinntteerreesstt  iinnccoommee |                                   |                                     |             |                  |                   |        |\n| 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate               | 1 12288                           | 2 2                                 | 1 13300     | 91               | 17                | 108    |\n| 100-basis-point decrease in the interest rate               | ( (114411))                       | ( (22))                             | ( (114433)) | (67)             | (17)              | (84)   |\n\n## I Innvveessttmmeenntt  GGoovveerrnnaannccee\n\nThe Bank has created securities portfolios in liquid and less liquid securities for strategic, long-term investment, and liquidity management purposes. These investments carry market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and concentration risk.\n\nThe investment governance framework sets out the guiding principles and general management standards that must be followed by all those who manage portfolios of these securities included in the portfolios of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this investment governance framework, business units that are active in managing these types of portfolios adopt internal investment policies that set, among other things, targets and limits for the allocation of assets in the portfolios concerned and internal approval mechanisms. The primary objective is to reduce concentration risk by industry, issuer, country, type of financial instrument, and credit quality.\n\nOverall limits in value and in proportion to the Bank's equity are set on the outstanding amount of liquid preferred shares, liquid equity securities excluding preferred shares, and instruments classified as illiquid securities in the securities portfolios. The overall exposure to common shares with respect to an individual issuer and the total outstanding amount invested in private equity funds, for investment banking services, are also subject to limits. Restrictions are also set on investments defined as special. Lastly, the Bank has a specific policy, approved by the RMC, applicable to investments in debt and equity securities, including strategic investments. Strategic investments are defined as purchases of business assets or acquisitions of significant interests in an entity for purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  FFoorreeiiggnn  EExxcchhaannggee  RRiisskk\n\nThe Bank's structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. This risk, predominantly in U.S. dollars, is measured by assessing the impact of currency fluctuations on retained earnings. The Bank uses financial instruments (derivative and non-derivative) to hedge this risk. An adverse change in foreign exchange rates can also impact the Bank's capital ratios due to the amount of RWA denominated in a foreign currency. When the Canadian dollar depreciates relative to other currencies, unrealized translation gains on the Bank's net investments in foreign operations, as well as the impact on hedging transactions, are reported in other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. In addition, the Canadian-dollar equivalent of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and regulatory capital deductions increases. The reverse is true when the Canadian dollar appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. The structural foreign exchange risk is managed to ensure that the potential impacts on the capital ratios and net income are within tolerable limits set by risk policies.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Liquidity and funding risk arises when sources of funds become insufficient to meet scheduled payments under the Bank's commitments. Liquidity risk stems from mismatched cash flows related to assets and liabilities as well as the characteristics of certain products such as credit commitments and nonfixed-term deposits.\n\nThe Bank's primary objective as a financial institution is to manage liquidity such that it supports the Bank's business strategy and allows it to honour its commitments when they come due, even in extreme conditions. This is done primarily by implementing a policy framework approved by the RMC, which establishes a risk appetite, monitoring structures controlled by various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities, and segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding plan that incorporates the expected growth of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Regulatory Environment\n\nThe Bank works closely with national and international regulators to implement regulatory liquidity standards. The Bank adapts its processes and policies to reflect its liquidity risk appetite towards these new requirements.\n\nThe Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) are reviewed annually to reflect domestic and international regulatory changes. They constitute OSFI's proposed liquidity framework and include six chapters:\n\n- \uf0b7 overview;\n- \uf0b7 liquidity coverage ratio (LCR);\n- \uf0b7 net stable funding ratio (NSFR);\n- \uf0b7 net cumulative cash flow (NCCF);\n- \uf0b7 liquidity monitoring tools;\n- \uf0b7 intraday liquidity monitoring tools.\n\nLCR is used to ensure that banks can overcome severe short-term stress, while the NSFR is a structural ratio over a one-year horizon. The NCCF metric is defined as a monitoring tool that calculates a survival period. It is based on the assumptions of a stress scenario prescribed by OSFI that aims to represent a combined systemic and bank-specific crisis. The Bank publishes LCR and NSFR on a quarterly basis, whereas NCCF is produced monthly and communicated to OSFI.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, OSFI released, for public consultation, revisions to its LAR guideline, which was to take effect in the first quarter of 2023. OSFI is making changes that will improve the sensitivity to risk and that will ensure that financial institutions hold sufficient cash or other liquid investments to meet potential liquidity needs and to support the continued lending of credit, in particular during periods of financial stress. On November 29, 2021, OSFI postponed the implementation of the revisions to its LAR guideline to April 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 31, 2022, OSFI published a final version of the liquidity rules, which reflects the most recent Basel III reforms and, on February 16, 2022, OSFI published the corresponding changes to the regulatory return, i.e., the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) return.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, OSFI published, for consultation purposes, a draft guideline entitled Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns. OSFI relies largely on the regulatory returns produced by financial institutions when assessing their safety and soundness. The purpose of this draft guideline is to better inform auditors and institutions on the work to be performed on regulatory returns in order to clarify and align OSFI's assurance expectations across all financial institutions. In particular, the draft guideline addresses the assurance that must be provided by an external audit, attestation by senior management, the assurance that must be provided by an internal audit, and the proposed effective dates. The Bank is actively participating in this consultation.\n\nThe Bank continues to closely monitor regulatory developments and actively participates in various consultation processes.",

Although the day-to-day and strategic management of risks associated with liquidity, funding, and pledging activities is assumed by the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Risk Management Group is responsible for assessing liquidity risk and overseeing compliance with the resulting policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that an appropriate risk management framework is in place and ensures compliance with the risk appetite framework. This structure provides an independent oversight and effective challenge for liquidity, funding, and pledging decisions, strategy, and exposure.\n\nThe Bank's Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance Policy requires review and approval by the RMC, based on recommendations from the GRC. The Bank has established three levels of limits. The first two levels involve the Bank's overall cash position and are respectively approved by the Board and the GRC, whereas the third level of limits focuses more on specific aspects of liquidity risk and is approved by the Financial Markets Risk Committee. The Board not only approves the supervision of day-to-day risk management and governance but also backup plans in anticipation of emergency and liquidity crisis situations. If a limit has to be revised, the Risk Management Group with the support of the Global Funding and Treasury Group, submits the proposed revision to the approving committee.\n\nOversight of liquidity risk is entrusted mainly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee, whose members include representatives of the Financial Markets segment, the Global Funding and Treasury Group, and the Risk Management Group.\n\nThe Bank also has policies and guidelines governing its own collateral pledged to counterparties, given the potential impact of such asset transfers on its liquidity. In accordance with its Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance Policy, the Bank conducts simulations of potential counterparty collateral claims under the CSAs in effect in the event of a Bank downgrade or other unlikely occurrences. The simulations are based on various Bank downgrading scenarios or market value fluctuations of transactions covered by CSAs.\n\nThrough the Financial Markets Risk Committee, the Risk Management Group regularly reports changes in liquidity, funding, and pledging indicators and compliance with regulatory-, Board-, and GRC-approved limits. If control reports indicate non-compliance with the limits and a general deterioration of liquidity indicators, the Global Funding and Treasury Group takes remedial action. According to an escalation process, problematic situations are reported to management and to the GRC and the RMC. An executive report on the Bank's liquidity and funding risk management is submitted quarterly to the RMC; this report describes the Bank's liquidity position and informs the Board of non-compliance with the limits and other rules observed during the reference period as well as remedial action taken.\n\n## LLiiqquuiiddiittyy  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe Bank performs liquidity management, funding, and pledging operations not only from its head office and regional offices in Canada, but also through certain foreign centres. Although the volume of such operations abroad represents a sizable portion of global liquidity management, the Bank's liquidity management is centralized. By organizing liquidity management, funding, and pledging activities within the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Bank can better coordinate enterprise-wide funding and risk monitoring activities. All internal funding transactions between Bank entities are controlled by the Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nThis centralized structure streamlines the allocation and control of liquidity management, funding, and pledging limits. Nonetheless, the Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance Policy contains special provisions for financial centres whose size and/or strategic importance makes them more likely to contribute to the Bank's liquidity risk. Consequently, a liquidity and funding risk management structure exists at each financial centre. This structure imposes a set of limits of varying levels, up to the limits approved by the RMC, on diverse liquidity parameters, including liquidity stress tests as well as simple concentration measures.\n\nThe Bank's funds transfer pricing system prices liquidity by allocating the cost or income to the various business segments. Liquidity costs are allocated to liquidity-intensive activities, mainly long-term loans, and commitments to extend credit and less liquid securities as well as strategic investments. The liquidity compensation is credited to the suppliers of funds, primarily funding in the form of stable deposits from the Bank's distribution network.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Among these ratios and parameters, the Bank pays particular attention to the funds obtained on the wholesale market and to cumulative cash flows over various time horizons.\n\nMoreover, the Bank's collateral pledging activities are monitored in relation to the different limits set by the Bank and are subject to monthly stress tests using various scenarios. In particular, the Bank uses various scenarios to estimate the potential amounts of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a downgrade to the Bank's credit rating.\n\nLiquidity risk can be assessed in many different ways using different liquidity indicators. One of the key liquidity risk monitoring tools is the Bank's survival period, which is based on contractual maturity and behavioural assumptions applied to balance sheet items as well as off-balance-sheet commitments.\n\n## Stress Testing\n\nUsing various simulations, survival period measures the number of months it would take to completely utilize the Bank's liquid assets if the Bank were to lose deposits prematurely or if funds from wholesale markets were not renewed at maturity. It is measured monthly using three scenarios, which were developed to assess sensitivity to a Bank-specific and/or systemic crisis. Deposit loss simulations are carried out based on their degree of stability, while the value of certain assets is encumbered by an amount reflecting their readiness for liquidation in a crisis. Appropriate scenarios and limits are included in the Bank's Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance Policy.\n\nThe Bank maintains an up-to-date, comprehensive financial contingency and crisis recovery plan that describes the measures to be taken in the event of a critical liquidity situation. This plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Board as part of business continuity and recovery planning. For additional information, see the Regulatory Compliance Risk section of this MD&A.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Appetite\n\nThe Bank monitors and manages its risk appetite through liquidity limits, ratios, and stress tests. The Bank's liquidity risk appetite is based on the following three principles:\n\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank has a sufficient amount of unencumbered liquid assets to cover its financial requirements, in both normal and stressed conditions;\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank keeps a liquidity buffer above the minimum regulatory requirement;\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank maintains diversified and stable sources of funding.\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nTo protect depositors and creditors from unexpected crisis situations, the Bank holds a portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets that can be readily liquidated to meet financial obligations. The majority of the unencumbered liquid assets are held in Canadian or U.S. dollars. Moreover, all assets that can be quickly monetized are considered liquid assets. The Bank's liquidity reserves do not factor in the availability of the emergency liquidity facilities of central banks. The following tables provide information on the Bank's encumbered and unencumbered assets.",

LCR is calculated by dividing the total amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by the total amount of net cash outflows. OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. An LCR above 100% ensures that banks are holding sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows given a severe, 30day liquidity crisis. The assumptions underlying the LCR scenario were established by the BCBS and OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline.\n\nThe following table provides average LCR data calculated using the daily figures in the quarter. For the quarter ended October 31, 2022, the Bank's average LCR was 140%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement and demonstrating the Bank's solid liquidity position.",

Bank's HQLA, which includes cash, central bank deposits, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government and Canadian provincial governments. Cash outflows arise from the application of OSFI-prescribed assumptions on deposits, debt, secured funding, commitments and additional collateral requirements. The cash outflows are partly offset by cash inflows, which come mainly from secured loans and performing loans. The Bank expects some quarter-over-quarter variation between reported LCRs without such variation being necessarily indicative of a trend. The variation between the quarter ended October 31, 2022 and the preceding quarter is a result of normal business operations. The Bank's liquid asset buffer is well in excess of its total net cash outflows. The LCR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures presented in the tables on the previous pages or those used for internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework is prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank's internal liquidity metrics use assumptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.\n\n## Intraday Liquidity\n\nThe Bank manages its intraday liquidity in such a way that the amount of available liquidity exceeds its maximum intraday liquidity requirements. The Bank monitors its intraday liquidity on an hourly basis, and the evolution thereof is presented monthly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe BCBS has developed the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to promote a more resilient banking sector. The NSFR requires institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. A viable funding structure is intended to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to an institution's regular sources of funding would erode its liquidity position in a way that would increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. NSFR is calculated by dividing available stable funding by required stable funding. OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "The NSFR represents the amount of ASF relative to the amount of RSF. ASF is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The amount of RSF of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution as well as those of its off-balance-sheet exposures. The amounts of ASF and RSF are calibrated to reflect the degree of stability of liabilities and liquidity of assets. The Bank expects some quarter-over-quarter variation between reported NSFRs without such variation being necessarily indicative of a trend.\n\nThe NSFR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures provided in the tables on the preceding pages or those used for internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework is prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank's internal liquidity metrics use assumptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg  RRiisskk\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk to the Bank's ongoing ability to raise sufficient funds to finance actual or proposed business activities on an unsecured or secured basis at an acceptable price. The Bank maintains a good balance of its funding through appropriate diversification of its unsecured funding vehicles, securitization programs, and secured funding. The Bank also diversifies its funding by currency, geography, and maturity. The funding management priority is to achieve an optimal balance between deposits, securitization, secured funding, and unsecured funding. This brings optimal stability to the funding and reduces vulnerability to unpredictable events.\n\nLiquidity and funding levels remained sound and robust over the year, and the Bank does not foresee any event, commitment, or demand that might have a significant impact on its liquidity and funding risk position. For additional information, see the table entitled Residual Contractual Maturities of Balance Sheet Items and Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nThe credit ratings assigned by ratings agencies represent their assessment of the Bank's credit quality based on qualitative and quantitative information provided to them. Credit ratings may be revised at any time based on various factors, including macroeconomic factors, the methodologies used by ratings agencies, or the current and projected financial condition of the Bank. Credit ratings are one of the main factors that influence the Bank's ability to access financial markets at a reasonable cost. A downgrade in the Bank's credit ratings could adversely affect the cost, size, and term of future funding and could also result in increased requirement to pledge collateral or decreased capacity to engage in certain collateralized business activities at a reasonable cost, including hedging and derivative transactions.\n\nLiquidity and funding levels remain sound and robust, and the Bank continues to enjoy excellent access to the market for its funding needs. The Bank received favourable credit ratings from all the agencies, reflecting the high quality of its debt instruments, and the Bank's objective is to maintain these strong credit ratings. On April 29, 2022, DBRS Morningstar (DBRS) raised the ratings of the Bank and its related entities, including the rating for long-term deposits and for long-term non-bail-inable senior debt to AA from AA(low), and it raised the rating for short-term senior debt to R-1(high) from R-1(mid). In addition, DBRS changed the trends of all the ratings to 'Stable' from 'Positive'. This change reflects DBRS's recognition of the Bank's solid performance in recent years. For Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, the outlook remains unchanged at 'Stable.' The following table presents the Bank's credit ratings according to four rating agencies as at October 31, 2022.\n\n## T Thhee  BBaannkk''ss  CCrreeddiitt  RRaattiinnggss\n\n|                                           |                 |            | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                           | M Mooooddyy''ss | S S&&PP    | D DBBRRSS                                       | F Fiittcchh                                     |\n| Short-term senior debt                    | P-1             | A-1        | R-1 (high)                                      | F1+                                             |\n| Canadian commercial paper                 |                 | A-1 (mid)  |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Long-term deposits                        | Aa3             |            | AA                                              | AA-                                             |\n| Long-term non-bail-inable senior debt (1) | Aa3             | A          | AA                                              | AA-                                             |\n| Long term senior debt (2)                 | A3              | BBB+       | AA (low)                                        | A+                                              |\n| NVCC subordinated debt                    | Baa2 (hyb)      | BBB        | A (low)                                         |                                                 |\n| NVCC limited recourse capital notes       | Ba1 (hyb)       | BB+        | BBB (high)                                      |                                                 |\n| NVCC preferred shares                     | Ba1 (hyb)       | P-3 (high) | Pfd-2                                           |                                                 |\n| Counterparty risk (3)                     | Aa3/P-1         |            |                                                 | AA-                                             |\n| Covered bonds program                     | Aaa             |            | AAA                                             | AAA                                             |\n| Rating outlook                            | Stable          | Stable     | Stable                                          | Stable                                          |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank's liquidity position management approach already incorporates additional collateral requirements in the event of a one-notch to three-notch downgrade. These additional collateral requirements are presented in the table below.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                  | O Onnee--nnoottcchh   d doowwnnggrraaddee       | T Thhrreeee--nnoottcchh   d doowwnnggrraaddee   |\n| Derivatives (1)                  | 3 300                                           | 9 988                                           |\n\n## Funding Strategy\n\nThe main objective of the funding strategy is to support the Bank's organic growth while also enabling it to survive potentially severe and prolonged crises and to meet its regulatory obligations and financial targets.\n\nThe Bank's funding framework is summarized as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 pursue a diversified deposit strategy to fund core banking activities through stable deposits coming from the networks of each of the Bank's major business segments;\n- \uf0b7 maintain sound liquidity risk management through centralized expertise and management of liquidity metrics within a predefined risk appetite;\n- \uf0b7 maintain active access to various markets to ensure a diversification of institutional funding in terms of source, geographic location, currency, instrument, and maturity, whether or not funding is secured.\n\nThe funding strategy is implemented in support of the Bank's overall objectives of strengthening its franchise among market participants and reinforcing its excellent reputation. The Bank continuously monitors and analyzes market trends as well as possibilities for accessing less expensive and more flexible funding, considering both the risks and opportunities observed. The deposit strategy remains a priority for the Bank, which continues to prefer deposits to institutional funding.\n\nThe Bank actively monitors and controls liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within and across entities, business segments, and currencies. The process involves evaluating the liquidity position of individual business segments in addition to that of the Bank as a whole as well as the liquidity risk from raising unsecured and secured funding in foreign currencies. The funding strategy is implemented through the funding plan and deposit strategy, which are monitored, updated to reflect actual results, and regularly evaluated.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nThe primary purpose of diversifying by source, geographic location, currency, instrument, maturity, and depositor is to mitigate liquidity and funding risk by ensuring that the Bank maintains alternative sources of funds that strengthen its capacity to withstand a variety of severe yet plausible institution-specific and market-wide shocks. To meet this objective, the Bank:\n\n- \uf0b7 takes funding diversification into account in the business planning process;\n- \uf0b7 maintains a variety of funding programs to access different markets;\n- \uf0b7 sets limits on funding concentration;\n- \uf0b7 maintains strong relationships with fund providers;\n- \uf0b7 is active in various funding markets of all tenors and for various instruments;\n- \uf0b7 identifies and monitors the main factors that affect the ability to raise funds.\n\nThe Bank is active in the following funding and securitization platforms:\n\n- \uf0b7 Canadian dollar Senior Unsecured Debt;\n- \uf0b7 U.S. dollar Senior Unsecured Debt programs;\n- \uf0b7 Canadian Medium-Term Note Shelf;\n- \uf0b7 U.S. dollar Commercial Paper programs;\n- \uf0b7 U.S. dollar Certificates of Deposit;\n- \uf0b7 Euro Medium-Term Note program;\n- \uf0b7 Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation securitization programs;\n- \uf0b7 Canadian Credit Card Trust II;\n- \uf0b7 Legislative Covered Bond program.",

Operational risk exists for every Bank activity. Theft, fraud, cyberattacks, unauthorized transactions, system errors, human error, amendments to or misinterpretation of laws and regulations, litigation or disputes with clients, inappropriate sales practice behaviour, or property damage are just a few examples of events likely to cause financial loss, harm the Bank's reputation, or lead to regulatory penalties or sanctions.\n\nAlthough operational risk cannot be eliminated entirely, it can be managed in a thorough and transparent manner to keep it at an acceptable level. The Bank's operational risk management framework is built on the concept of three lines of defence and provides a clear allocation of responsibilities to all levels of the organization, as mentioned below.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nThe operational risk management framework is described in the Operational Risk Management Policy, which is derived from the Risk Management Policy. The operational risk management framework is aligned with the Bank's risk appetite and is made up of policies, standards, and procedures specific to each operational risk, which fall under the responsibility of specialized groups.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), a subcommittee of the GRC, is the main governance committee overseeing operational risk matters. Its mission is to provide oversight of the operational risk level across the organization to ensure it aligns with the Bank's risk appetite targets. It implements effective frameworks for managing operational risk, including policies and standards, and monitors the application thereof.\n\nThe segments use several operational risk management tools and methods to identify, assess, and manage their operational risks and control measures. With these tools and methods, the segments can:\n\n- \uf0b7 recognize and understand the inherent and residual risks to which their activities and operations are exposed;\n- \uf0b7 identify how to manage and monitor the identified risks to keep them at an acceptable level;\n- \uf0b7 proactively and continuously manage risks.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This process helps determine the Bank's exposure to the operational risks and operational losses incurred and assess the effectiveness of internal controls. It also helps limit operational events, keep losses at an acceptable level and, as a result, reduce potential capital charges and lower the likelihood of damage to the Bank's reputation. These data are processed and saved in a centralized database and are periodically the subject of a quality assurance exercise.\n\n## Analysis and Lessons Learned From Operational Incidents Observed in Other Large Businesses\n\nBy collecting and analyzing media-reported information about significant operational incidents, in particular incidents related to fraud, information security, and theft of personal information experienced by other organizations, the Bank can assess the effectiveness of its own operational risk management practices and reinforce them, if necessary.\n\n## Operational Risk Self-Assessment Program\n\nThe operational risk self-assessment program gives each business unit and corporate unit the means to proactively identify and assess the new or major operational risks to which they are exposed, evaluate the effectiveness of mitigating controls, and develop action plans to keep such risks at acceptable levels. As such, the program helps in anticipating factors that could hinder performance or the achievement of objectives.\n\n## Key Risk Indicators\n\nKey risk indicators are used to monitor the main operational risk exposure factors and track how risks are evolving in order to proactively manage them. The business units and corporate units define the key indicators associated with their main operational risks and assign tolerance thresholds to them. These indicators are monitored periodically and, when they show a significant increase in risk or when a tolerance threshold is exceeded, they are sent to an appropriate level in the hierarchy and action plans are implemented as required.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario analysis, which is part of a Bank-wide stress testing program, is an important and useful tool for assessing the impacts related to potentially serious events. It is used to define the risk appetite, set risk exposure limits, and engage in business planning. More specifically, scenario analysis provides management with a better understanding of the risks faced by the Bank and helps it make appropriate management decisions to mitigate potential operational risks that are inconsistent with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## Insurance Program\n\nTo protect itself against any material losses arising from unforeseeable operational risk exposure, the Bank also has adequate insurance, the nature and amount of which meet its coverage requirements.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  RReeppoorrttss  aanndd  DDiisscclloossuurreess\n\nOperational events for which the financial impact exceeds tolerance thresholds or that have a significant regulatory or reputation impact are submitted to appropriate decision-making levels. Management is obligated to report on its management process and to remain alert to current and future issues. Reports on the Bank's risk profile, highlights, and emerging risks are periodically submitted, on a timely basis, to the ORMC, the GRC, and the RMC. This reporting enhances the transparency and proactive management of the main operational risk factors.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  CCoommpplliiaannccee  RRiisskk\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk of the Bank or of one of its employees or business partners failing to comply with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally. Regulatory compliance risk is present in all of the daily operations of each Bank segment. A situation of regulatory non-compliance can adversely affect the Bank's reputation and result in penalties and sanctions or increased oversight by regulators.\n\n## O Orrggaanniizzaattiioonnaall  SSttrruuccttuurree  ooff  CCoommpplliiaannccee\n\nCompliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank. The Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer serves as both chief compliance officer (CCO) and chief anti-money laundering officer (CAMLO) for the Bank and its subsidiaries and foreign centres. She is responsible for implementing and updating the Bank's programs for regulatory compliance management, regulatory requirements related to AML/ATF, international sanctions, and the fight against corruption. The CCO and CAMLO has a direct relationship with the Chair of the RMC and meets with him at least once every quarter. She can also communicate directly with senior management, officers, and directors of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres.",

To ensure sound management of regulatory compliance, the Bank favours proactive approaches and incorporates regulatory requirements into its day-to-day operations.\n\nSuch proactive management also provides reasonable assurance that the Bank is in compliance, in all material respects, with the regulatory requirements in\n\neffect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.\n\nThe implementation of a regulatory compliance risk management framework across the Bank is entrusted to the Compliance Service, which has the following mandate:\n\n- \uf0b7 implement policies and standards that ensure compliance with current regulatory requirements, including those related to AML/ATF, to international sanctions, and to the fight against corruption;\n- \uf0b7 develop compliance and AML/ATF training programs for Bank employees, officers, and directors;\n- \uf0b7 exercise independent oversight and monitoring of the programs, policies, and procedures implemented by the management of the Bank, its subsidiaries, and its foreign centres to ensure that the control mechanisms are sufficient, respected, and effective;\n- \uf0b7 report relevant compliance and AML/ATF matters to the Bank's Board and inform it of any significant changes in the effectiveness of the risk management framework.\n\nThe Bank holds itself to high regulatory compliance risk management standards in order to earn the trust of its clients, its shareholders, the market, and the general public.\n\nDescribed below are the main regulatory developments that have been monitored over the past year.\n\n## Reform of the Official Languages Act  (federal law)\n\nBill C-13, An Act to amend the Official Languages Act, to enact the Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act and to make related amendments to other Acts, proposes to modernize the Official Languages Act by granting new powers to the Commissioner of Official Languages (entering into compliance agreements, issuing orders, and imposing penalties). The bill also proposes enactment of a new act, namely, the Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act, which addresses the language of service for consumers and the language of work in Quebec and in regions with a strong francophone presence.\n\n## Bill 96: An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Quebec (Quebec law)\n\nBill 96 makes amendments to the Charter of the French Language and other laws. The objectives are to strengthen the presence and use of the French language in Quebec, to establish a new Charter of the French Language, and to affirm that French is the only official language of Quebec. Key aspects of Bill 96 notably include francization committees, work and employment rights, contracts and consumer rights, litigation and the publication of rights, and public signs and commercial advertising. Bill 96 was assented to on June 1, 2022.\n\n## Bill 18 - Protection of Vulnerable Persons\n\nBill 18, An Act to amend the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Public Curator Act and various provisions as regards the protection of persons, has abolished curatorships and adviserships to persons of full age. Tutorships to persons of full age will remain in place, but it will be possible to modulate them based on the incapacity level of the person of full age. The new law will create temporary representation of persons of full age and assistants to persons of full age. The effective date, initially expected in June, was postponed to November 2022.\n\n## Consumer Protection (Bank Act)\n\nA new Financial Consumer Protection Framework (C-86) took effect on June 30, 2022. It modernized certain provisions of the Bank Act and related regulations in order to strengthen consumer protections, notably through additional communications to customers, assessments of product and service appropriateness, employee training, reporting of wrongdoings (whistleblowing), and complaint handling processes.\n\n## Bill C-30 Addressing Unclaimed Bank Balances, Among Other Matters\n\nBill C-30 makes an amendment to the Bank Act. Unclaimed balances refer in particular to a deposit in an inactive bank account and will now include deposits and instruments in foreign currencies. This plan requires financial institutions to send letters to clients to inform them of the existence of unclaimed balances. An electronic notice must also be sent when the financial institution possesses the electronic contact information of the clients. Additional information regarding clients who have an unclaimed balance will also have to be sent to the Bank of Canada. The effective date of the bill is anticipated to be June 30, 2023.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) Activities\n\nAmendments made to the regulations set out in the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act took effect on June 1, 2021. The new reporting requirements are expected to take effect in 2023-2024 such that the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) can prepare the new reporting forms.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Protection of Personal Information\n\nGiven changing technologies and societal behaviours, privacy and the protection of personal information is a topical issue in Canada. Recent regulatory measures (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe in 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the United States in 2020) reflect a desire to implement a stronger legislative framework in the areas of confidentiality and use of personal information. In Quebec, in September 2021, the government adopted Bill 64, An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information, which has introduced substantial changes regarding the protection of personal information. Essentially, the Act promotes transparency, raises the confidentiality level of data, and provides a framework for the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. At the federal level, Bill C-27, tabled in June 2022, enacts three new laws: the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act, the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act. The latter act is the first bill designed to regulate artificial intelligence in Canada. Members of industry, regulatory agencies, and consumer advocates were consulted to help design and establish the pillars of an open banking system, which enable consumers to transfer their financial data between financial institutions and accredited third parties in a secure and user-friendly manner.\n\n## Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)\n\nOn April 30, 2022, separate coverage for registered education savings plans and registered disability savings plans was granted as part of changes to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act. New requirements were established for the coverage of deposits in trust, particularly nominee-brokered deposits and those of professional trustees.\n\n## Recovery and Resolution Planning\n\nAs part of the regulatory measures used to manage systemic risks, D-SIBs are required to prepare recovery and resolution plans. A recovery plan is essentially a roadmap that guides the recovery of a bank in the event of severe financial stress; conversely, a resolution plan guides its orderly wind-down in the event of failure when recovery is no longer an option. The Bank improves and periodically updates its recovery and resolution plans to prepare for these high-risk, but low-probability, events. In addition, the Bank and other D-SIBs continue to work with the CDIC to maintain a comprehensive settlement plan that would ensure an orderly winding down of the Bank's operations. These plans are approved by the Board and submitted to the national regulatory agencies.\n\n## Section 871(m) - Dividend Equivalent Payments\n\nSection 871(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) aims to ensure that non-U.S. persons pay tax on payments that can be considered dividends on U.S. shares, when these payments are made on certain derivative instruments. The derivative instruments for which the underlyings are U.S. shares (including U.S. exchange-traded funds) or 'non-qualified indices' concluded as of January 1, 2017 are subject to the withholding and reporting requirements. The effective date for certain components of this regulation has been deferred to January 1, 2023. Some of the obligations of a qualified derivatives dealer, established under section 871(m) of the IRC and the qualified intermediary agreement, have also been deferred to January 1, 2023. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has informed market participants that it is working on a new notice that would again postpone these obligations beyond 2023.\n\n## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Common Reporting Standard\n\nThe U.S. law addressing foreign account tax compliance (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA), and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), an international standard, the principles of which have been incorporated into the Income Tax Act (Canada), are intended to counter tax evasion by taxpayers through the international exchange of tax information through financial institutions. On March 10, 2022, clarifications were provided on the application of some of the guidelines in these regulations.\n\n## Client-Centred Reforms - Amendments to Regulation 31-103\n\nPursuant to Regulation 31-103 respecting Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant obligations, regulatory changes were made to the process for declaring conflicts of interest and external activities and to the following topics: KYC (know-your-client) and KYP (know-your-product), suitability determination, misleading communications, relationship disclosure, and training. The Bank is ensuring that it is compliant with these changes as they are published.\n\n## Reform of Interest Rate Benchmarks\n\nThe reform of interest rate benchmarks is a global initiative that is being coordinated and led by central banks and governments around the world, including Canada. The objective is to improve benchmarks by ensuring that they meet robust international standards. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rates) in particular is in the process of being discontinued, and risk-free rates such as SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), ESTR (Euro Short-Term Rate), SONIA (Sterling Over Night Index Average), SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight), and TONAR (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate) are recommended as replacements for LIBOR. On December 31, 2021, all LIBOR rates in European, British, Swiss, and Japanese currency as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates were discontinued, whereas the other USD LIBOR rates will be discontinued after June 30, 2023. In Canada, publication of the CDOR (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate) will be discontinued on June 28, 2024 and be replaced by the risk-free rate CORRA (Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average).

        "page_content": "## One-Day Settlement Cycle\n\nIn February 2022, the CSA staff published a notice to inform Canadian securities stakeholders about an initiative to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most trades in securities from two days to one day.  This notice follows a report published in the U.S. securities sector indicating that it has set March 31, 2024 as the date for transitioning the standard settlement cycle in the U.S. to one day from the current settlement time of two days. Aligning the Canadian and U.S. settlement cycles is critical so as to avoid inefficiencies and prevent any prejudicial impact on Canadian investors and capital markets. The move towards a shortened settlement cycle will result in changes to systems, regulations, and procedures.\n\n## New Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO)\n\nThe CSA will create a new self-regulatory organization that will, among other things, combine the functions of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada. This new organization is expected to be operational by the end of 2022. A working committee was created to assess the potential impacts and benefits of this new structure for Wealth Management and the National Bank Investments subsidiary.\n\n## R Reeppuuttaattiioonn  RRiisskk\n\nReputation risk is the risk that the Bank's operations or practices will be judged negatively by the public, whether that judgment is with or without basis, thereby adversely affecting the perception, image, or trademarks of the Bank and potentially resulting in costly litigation or loss of income. Reputation risk generally arises from a deficiency in managing another risk. The Bank's reputation may, for example, be adversely affected by non-compliance with laws and regulations or by process failures. All risks must therefore be managed effectively in order to protect the Bank's reputation.\n\nThe Bank's corporate culture continually promotes the behaviours and values to be adopted by employees. It creates an awareness among all employees about the potential consequences of their actions on the Bank's reputation and brand. In addition to the above-mentioned operational risk management initiatives, the Bank uses a variety of mechanisms to support sound management of reputation risk. Our Code of Conduct outlines what is expected from each employee in terms of ethical behaviour and rules to be followed as they carry out their duties. Also supporting our corporate culture are policies specifically addressing ethics and corporate governance as well as appropriate training programs. The Bank also has a crisis management framework featuring effective intervention, communication, and behavioural parameters that help to minimize any impact on business activities, clients, and employees.\n\nThe Bank also has a reputation risk policy, approved by the RMC, that covers all of the Bank's practices and activities. The policy sets the reputation risk management principles and rules for clients, employees, and communities, all of which are stakeholders of the Bank. The policy is complemented by the special provisions of the new products and activities policy, which determines the approvals required by the various committees that assess risk whenever new products or activities are introduced within the business units. These provisions are intended, among other things, to provide oversight for the management of reputation risk, which may be material for such products or activities. The new products and activities policy requires that any new product or activity for which reputation risk is determined to be high be submitted to the GRC for approval. The activities of the Compliance Service, Legal Affairs Department, Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility Department and Investor Relations Department complete the reputation risk management framework.\n\n## S Sttrraatteeggiicc  RRiisskk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a financial loss or of reputational harm arising from inappropriate strategic orientations, improper execution, or ineffective response to economic, financial, or regulatory changes. The corporate strategic plan is developed by the Senior Leadership Team, in alignment with the Bank's overall risk appetite, and approved by the Board. Once approved, the initiatives of the strategic plan are monitored regularly to ensure that they are progressing. If not, strategies could be reviewed or adjusted if deemed appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the Bank has a specific Board-approved policy for strategic investments, which are defined as purchases of business assets or acquisitions of significant interests in an entity for the purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship. As such, acquisition projects and other strategic investments are analyzed through a due diligence process to ensure that these investments are aligned with the corporate strategic plan and the Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## E Ennvviirroonnmmeennttaall  aanndd  SSoocciiaall  RRiisskk\n\nEnvironmental and social risk is the possibility that environmental and social matters would result in a financial loss for the Bank or affect its business activities. The Bank is directly exposed to such risk through its own activities and indirectly exposed through the activities of its clients. This risk encompasses many topics, in particular pollution and waste; the use of energy, water, and other resources; climate change; biodiversity; human rights; inclusion, diversity and equity; labour standards and human capital management practices; community health; occupational health and safety; the rights of Indigenous Peoples and consultation thereof; as well as cultural heritage. The impact of environmental and social risk could also increase exposure to strategic, reputation, and regulatory compliance risks if the Bank's response is deemed inadequate or non-compliant with commitments. As such, it is possible that the Bank's predictions, targets, projections, expectations or conclusions prove to be inaccurate, that its assumptions may not be confirmed, and that its strategic objectives and performance targets will not be achieved.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Assessing and mitigating environmental and social risk are integral parts of the Bank's risk management framework. Environmental and social issues are now central to the Bank's decision-making process and are becoming increasingly imperative to the Bank. Addressing such risk may even prove to be a considerable asset in certain financing or investment transactions, and doing so also contributes to promoting exemplary practices to the Bank's stakeholders.\n\nThe Bank has adopted environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles that show the importance it attaches to sustainable development and to balancing the interests of societal stakeholders. These ESG principles have been incorporated into the organization's priorities, and ESG indicators have been added to various monitoring dashboards and are gradually being integrated into the Bank's risk appetite framework. Reports on these indicators and on the Bank's ESG commitments are being periodically presented to various internal committees and to Board committees. In addition, the Bank's Code of Conduct outlines what is expected from each employee in their professional, business, and community interactions. It also provides guidance on adhering to the Bank's values, on the day-to-day conduct of the Bank's affairs, and on relationships with third parties, employees, and clients to create an environment conducive to achieving the Bank's One Mission, namely, to have a positive impact on people's lives.\n\nThe Bank has also implemented an environmental policy that applies to all activities and decisions made across the Bank. This policy clearly sets out principles for identifying and limiting environmental risk and climate risk as well as the impacts therefrom on the community and on the Bank's business segments. The Bank is pursuing its commitment to carbon neutrality by reducing the carbon footprint of its own activities and by offsetting its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through various organizations. The Bank is also prioritizing energy efficiency and has demonstrated leadership in this regard by deploying an innovative system that lets it regulate the energy consumption of 260 branches using building control systems and a web interface. In addition, responsible procurement criteria have been incorporated into the purchasing and supplier selection practices for the construction of the Bank's new head office building. The new head office is, in fact, aiming to achieve LEED v4 (1) Gold certification in addition to WELL (2) certification. Furthermore, we are continuing to work on the implementation of a global responsible procurement strategy.\n\nESG factors continue to be integrated into the Bank's processes, in line with its strategy and the guiding principles approved by the Board. This integration is being conducted with due diligence, particularly in the area of credit-granting, and starting with the corporate credit portfolio. For this clientele, ESG risk is being analyzed using a collection of carbon footprint information and a climate risk classification (transition and physical risks) based on industry as well as scores assigned by ESG-rating agencies. Several other criteria are also being considered, notably waste management, labour standards, corporate governance, product liability, and human rights policies. The Bank plans to gradually extend the collection of such information to clients in other portfolios by adapting the current process.\n\nThe Bank collaborates with various industry partners to identify and implement sound management practices to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Aware that it has a mobilizing role to play, the Bank supports the recommendations of the TCFD and continues to demonstrate its commitment to mitigating climate risk. For example, it has become a signatory to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) as well as the United Nations' NetZero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This year, the Bank also began quantifying financed GHG emissions. Specifically, it quantified the emissions of oil and gas producers in its loan portfolio, and it has also set its first interim reduction targets under its PCAF and NZBA commitments. These targets consist of a 31% reduction in the intensity of the portfolio respectively for direct and indirect energy-related emissions and for other indirect emissions. In the next two years, the Bank plans to continue setting GHG emission reduction targets for other portfolios. The Bank has also started examining stress test scenarios to quantify the anticipated losses in the loan portfolio. Also during the year, the Bank joined the UNEP-FI's discussion group on biodiversity protection. This is an initiative seeking to mobilize financial system stakeholders towards biodiversity protection efforts, as the financial risk arising from biodiversity loss may take the form of both physical risk and transition risk. Given that this initiative is in its early stages, the Bank will continue to closely monitor the evolution thereof and take part in discussions. The Bank has also started taking concrete action to meet its commitments and to move its plan forward, notably by quantifying the financial impacts of environmental and social risk. Furthermore, the Bank is committed to transparently communicating information about its progress and its signatory commitments by periodically publishing its own performance reports.\n\nTo proactively ensure the strategic positioning of its entire portfolio, the Bank continues to support the transition to a low-carbon economy while closely monitoring the related developments and implications. Doing so involves ongoing and stronger adaptation efforts as well as additional mitigation measures for instances of business interruptions or disruptions caused by major incidents such as natural disasters or health crises. Such measures include the business continuity plan, the operational risk management program, and the disaster risk management program.\n\n- (1) Criteria of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification system. LEED certification involves satisfying climate criteria and adaptation characteristics that will help limit potential physical climate risks.\n- (2) The WELL Standard, administered by the International WELL Building Institute, recognizes environments that support the health and well-being of the occupants.",

The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical given their importance to the presentation of the Bank's financial position and operating results and require subjective and complex judgments and estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain. Any change in these judgments and estimates could have a significant impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and the geopolitical landscape, in particular supply chain disruptions and rising inflation, are persisting and creating uncertainty. As a result, establishing reliable estimates and applying judgment continue to be substantially complex. Some of the Bank's accounting policies, such as measurement of expected credit losses (ECLs), require particularly complex judgments and estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the most significant estimation processes used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and the valuation techniques used to determine carrying values and fair values of assets and liabilities. The uncertainty regarding certain key inputs used in measuring ECLs is described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## C Cllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss\n\nAt initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFor the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWhen classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the relevant evidence available to the Bank at the date of determination.\n\nA financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect' business model when the Bank's primary objective is to hold these financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows from them and not to sell them. When the Bank's objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank's objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a 'hold to collect' business model or a 'hold to collect and sell' business model.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhen there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the measurement date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is terminated before maturity.\n\nIn certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair value but that are not included in the valuation technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or valuation model risk and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient volume of transactions in a given market. The measurement adjustments also include the funding valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions.\n\nIFRS establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. The fair value measurement hierarchy has the following levels:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n\n## Level 2\n\nValuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and certain other liabilities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nValuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs. Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of investments in hedge funds, certain derivative financial instruments, equity and debt securities of private companies, certain loans, certain deposits (structured deposit notes), and certain other assets.\n\nEstablishing fair value is an accounting estimate and has an impact on the following items: Securities at fair value through profit or loss, certain Loans, Securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, Obligations related to securities sold short, Derivative financial instruments, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, and financial instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This estimate also has an impact on Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income of the Financial Markets segment and of the Other heading. Lastly, this estimate has an impact on Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimates, determining movements between the three stages, and applying forward-looking information. Any changes in assumptions and estimates, as well as the use of different, but equally reasonable, estimates and assumptions, could have an impact on the allowances for credit losses and the provisions for credit losses for the year. All business segments are affected by this accounting estimate. For additional information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## DDeetteerrmmiinniinngg  tthhee  SSttaaggee\n\nThe ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, is recorded. When there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of a financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset occurs, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime expected credit losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSiiggnniiffiiccaanntt  IInnccrreeaassee  iinn  CCrreeddiitt  RRiisskk\n\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking information to assess deterioration in the credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment.\n\n## MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess\n\nECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. Cash shortfalls represent the difference between all contractual cash flows owed to the Bank and all cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.\n\nThe measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Forwardlooking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) are incorporated into the risk parameters. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. Probability weights are assigned to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and are subject to management review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process.\n\nECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Allowances for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are not measured at fair value are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than the ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## DDeeffiinniittiioonn  ooff  DDeeffaauulltt\n\nThe definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following dates: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due.\n\n## W Wrriittee--OOffffss\n\nA financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances owing are not likely to be recovered.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nPremises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment test compares the carrying amount of an asset with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs will be determined. Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or a group of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected future cash flows, discount rates, and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant impact on income. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nManagement exercises judgment when determining whether there is objective evidence that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. It also uses judgment in determining to which CGU or group of CGUs an asset or goodwill is to be allocated. Moreover, for impairment assessment purposes, management must make estimates and assumptions regarding the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, CGUs, or a group of CGUs. For additional information on the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAny changes to these estimates and assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amount of a non-financial asset and, consequently, on impairment testing results. These accounting estimates have an impact on Premises and equipment, Intangible assets and Goodwill reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The aggregate impairment loss, if any, is recognized as a non-interest expense for the corresponding segment and presented in the Other  item.\n\n## E Emmppllooyyeeee  BBeenneeffiittss  --  PPeennssiioonn  PPllaannss  aanndd  OOtthheerr  PPoosstt--EEmmppllooyymmeenntt  BBeenneeffiitt  PPllaannss\n\nThe expense and obligation of the defined benefit component of the pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are actuarially determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities, presented in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current information. The Bank periodically evaluates deferred tax assets to assess recoverability. In the Bank's opinion, based on the information at its disposal, it is probable that all deferred tax assets will be realized before they expire.\n\nThis accounting estimate affects Income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income for all business segments.

The recent developments in the main legal proceeding involving the Bank are as follows:\n\n## Defrance\n\nOn January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the National Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Bank's consolidated results of operations for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank's consolidated financial position.\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank's best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money.\n\nThe recognition of a litigation provision requires the Bank's management to assess the probability of loss and estimate any potential monetary impact. The Bank examines each litigation provision individually by considering the development of each case, its past experience in similar transactions and the opinion of its legal counsel. Each new piece of information can alter the Bank's assessment as to the probability and estimated amount of the loss and the extent to which it adjusts the recorded provision. Moreover, the actual settlement cost of these litigations can be significantly higher or lower than the amounts recognized.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Structured entities are entities designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity is consolidated when the Bank concludes, after evaluating the substance of the relationship and its right or exposure to variable returns, that it controls that entity. Management must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank controls an entity. Additional information is provided in the Securitization and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements section of this MD&A and in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## A Accccoouunnttiinngg  PPoolliiccyy  CChhaannggeess\n\n## C Clloouudd  CCoommppuuttiinngg  AArrrraannggeemmeennttss  --  FFiinnaall  AAggeennddaa  DDeecciissiioonn  bbyy  IIFFRRIICC\n\nIn April 2021, IFRIC issued a final agenda decision on accounting for the costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's software as part of a cloud computing or SaaS (Software as a Service) arrangement. The main conclusion was that, if the incurred configuration or customization costs do not give rise to an intangible asset that is separate from the software or if the services received are distinct from the software, those costs are expensed as incurred. IFRIC decided that the relevant accounting standards (IAS 38 - Intangible Assets and IFRS 15 - Revenue From Contracts With Customers) contain sufficient guidance and that the conclusions, as indicated in the final agenda decision, are part of the interpretation of IFRS. As such, any change arising from these interpretations must be accounted for as a retrospectively applied accounting policy change in accordance with IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Bank completed an assessment of the impacts of this change in accounting policy. The change was applied retrospectively and had the following impacts on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \uf0b7 As at November 1, 2020: A $186 million decrease in Intangible assets, a $49 million increase in Other assets - Deferred tax assets, and a $137 million decrease in Retained earnings;\n- \uf0b7 As at October 31, 2021: A $50 million decrease in Intangible assets and a $13 million increase in Other assets - Deferred tax assets;\n- \uf0b7 For the year ended October 31, 2021: A $50 million increase in Non-interest expenses - Technology, a $13 million decrease in Income taxes, a $37 million decrease in Net income and Net income attributable to common shareholders, and a $0.11 decrease in Earnings per share - Basic and diluted.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, the impacts of this accounting policy change on the Consolidated Statement of Income consisted of a $10 million increase in Non-interest expenses - Technology and a $3 million decrease in Income taxes.\n\n## F Fuuttuurree  AAccccoouunnttiinngg  PPoolliiccyy  CChhaannggeess\n\nThe Bank closely monitors both new accounting standards and amendments to existing accounting standards issued by the IASB. The following standard has been issued but is not yet in effect. The Bank is currently assessing the impacts of applying this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## E Effffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  --  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22002233\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), a new standard that replaces IFRS 4, the current insurance contract accounting standard. IFRS 17 introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. IFRS 17 provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 will affect how an entity accounts for its insurance contracts and how it reports financial performance in the consolidated income statement, in particular the timing of revenue recognition for insurance contracts. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 that included a two-year deferral of the effective date along with other changes aimed at addressing concerns and implementation challenges identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017. IFRS 17, as amended, is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. If full retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach may be used.\n\nTo prepare for the application of IFRS 17, the Bank developed a project, set up a specialized team, and established a formal governance structure. It also started executing a detailed plan for the project that defines key activities and the timing of those activities. The project is progressing according to schedule. The Bank is continuing to assess all of the impacts of applying IFRS 17 on its consolidated financial statements as well as on the financial statements of its insurance subsidiary.",

Non-interest income consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses as well as interest income on securities measured at fair value through profit or loss, income from held-for-trading derivative financial instruments, changes in the fair value of loans at fair value through profit or loss, changes in the fair value of financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, certain commission income, other trading activity revenues, and any applicable transaction costs.\n\n## V Vaalluuee--aatt--RRiisskk  ((VVaaRR))\n\nVaR is a statistical measure of risk that is used to quantify market risks across products, per types of risks, and aggregate risk on a portfolio basis. VaR is defined as the maximum loss at a specific confidence level over a certain horizon under normal market conditions. The VaR method has the advantage of providing a uniform measurement of financial-instrumentrelated market risks based on a single statistical confidence level and time horizon.",

IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS.\n\nManagement maintains the accounting and internal control systems needed to discharge its responsibility, which is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial accounts are accurate and complete and that the Bank's assets are adequately safeguarded. Controls that are currently in place include quality standards on staff hiring and training; the implementation of organizational structures with clear divisions of responsibility and accountability for performance; the Code of Professional Conduct; and the communication of operating policies and procedures.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer, we have overseen the evaluation of the design and operation of the Bank's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings released by the Canadian Securities Administrators. Based on the evaluation work performed, we have concluded that the internal control over financial reporting and the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at October 31, 2022 and that they provide reasonable assurance that the Bank's financial information is reliable and that its consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving the financial information contained in the Annual Report. Acting through the Audit Committee, the Board also oversees the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and ensures that accounting and control systems are maintained. Composed of directors who are neither officers nor employees of the Bank, the Audit Committee is responsible, through Internal Audit, for performing an independent and objective review of the Bank's internal control effectiveness, i.e., governance processes, risk management processes and control measures. Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviews the consolidated financial statements and recommends their approval to the Board.\n\nThe control systems are further supported by the presence of the Compliance Service, which exercises independent oversight and evaluation in order to assist managers in effectively managing regulatory compliance risk and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with regulatory requirements.\n\nBoth the Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit and the Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer have a direct functional link to the Chair of the Audit Committee and to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee. They both also have direct access to the President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), OSFI is mandated to protect the rights and interests of depositors. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into the business and affairs of the Bank, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being satisfied and that the Bank is in sound financial condition.\n\nThe independent auditor, Deloitte LLP, whose report follows, was appointed by the shareholders at the recommendation of the Board.

We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## KKeeyy  AAuuddiitt  MMaatttteerrss\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2022.

The calculation of ECL is based on the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) of the underlying assets and represents an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate of losses expected to occur in the future based on forecasts of macroeconomic variables for three scenarios. Lifetime ECL is recorded for financial assets that have experienced significant increases in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or that are impaired; otherwise, 12-month ECL is recorded. Given uncertainty surrounding the key inputs used to measure credit losses, the Bank has applied expert credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results.\n\nWe have identified the allowances for credit losses as a key audit matter due to the inherent complexity of the ECL models used and the significant judgment required by management in relation to the forward-looking nature of some key assumptions, including the impact of a possible recession on the economy. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating: (i) the models and methodologies used to measure ECL; (ii) the forecasts of macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weighting; (iii) the determination of SICR; and (iv) the adjustments to the modelled ECL results representing management's expert credit judgment. Auditing the ECL models and the key judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills in credit risk and economics.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the models and the key judgments and assumptions used by management to estimate the ECL included the following, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 With the assistance of professionals with specialized skills in credit risk or economics:\n- o For a selection of ECL models, evaluated the appropriateness of the models used to estimate ECL;\n- o Evaluated the forecasts of macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weighting by comparing them against independently developed forecasts and publicly available industry data, including the impact of a possible recession;\n- o Assessed management's determination of SICR and the appropriateness of the related model's programming;\n- o Assessed the adjustments to the modelled ECL results by evaluating management's expert credit judgment.",

The Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. These provisions reflect management's best possible estimate of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. As disclosed in Note 24, the Bank was reassessed by the tax authorities for additional income taxes and interest in respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank for certain taxation years and may be reassessed for subsequent taxation years in regard to similar activities. The Bank has not recognized any tax liability related to these uncertain tax positions.\n\nWe have identified the assessment of the accounting of the uncertain tax positions related to certain Canadian dividends as a key audit matter given the significant judgment made by management when evaluating the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions and when interpreting relevant tax and case law and administrative positions. Auditing these judgments required a high degree of auditor judgment and resulted in an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of tax specialists.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures pertaining to the assessment of the accounting of the uncertain tax positions related to certain Canadian dividends included the following, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 With the assistance of tax specialists, evaluated management's assessment of the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions by assessing:\n- o The Bank's interpretations of relevant tax and case law and administrative positions;\n- o The advice and legal opinions obtained by the Bank's external tax advisors.\n- o The correspondence with the relevant tax authorities; and\n\n## OOtthheerr  IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe obtained Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor's report. If, based on the work we have performed on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor's report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Carl Magnan.\n\n## / /ss//  DDeellooiittttee  LLLLPP 1 1\n\nNovember 29, 2022 Montreal, Quebec",

Its head office is located at 600 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street West in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Bank is a chartered bank under Schedule 1 of the Bank Act (Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI). The Bank offers financial services to individuals, businesses, institutional clients, and governments throughout Canada as well as specialized services at the international level. It operates four business segments: the Personal and Commercial segment, the Wealth Management segment, the Financial Markets segment, and the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. Its full line of services includes banking and investing solutions for individuals and businesses, corporate banking and investment banking services, securities brokerage, insurance, and wealth management.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the publication of the Bank's audited annual consolidated financial statements (the consolidated financial statements) for the year ended October 31, 2022.\n\n## B Baassiiss  ooff  PPrreesseennttaattiioonn\n\nThe Bank's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements also comply with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by OSFI, the consolidated financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. The accounting policies described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section have been applied consistently to all periods presented, except for the change described hereafter in the Accounting Policy Changes section, which were applied retrospectively during the year ended October 31, 2022 as a result of a final agenda decision made by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) regarding the costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's software application as part of a cloud computing arrangement. To reflect this change in accounting policy, figures from the year ended October 31, 2021 have been adjusted.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  RRaattee  BBeenncchhmmaarrkk  RReeffoorrmm\n\nThe reform of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and other interest rate benchmarks is a global initiative being coordinated and led by central banks and governments around the world, including those in Canada. This reform has been unfolding for several years, with the IASB monitoring developments. To minimize the financial statement impacts arising from replacing current interest rate benchmarks with alternative benchmarks, the IASB amended certain IFRS standards and allowed for some temporary exemptions, notably in the area of hedge accounting.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Bank transitioned its LIBOR-related (London Interbank Offered Rates) contracts that involve pound sterling (GBP), the euro (EUR), the Japanese yen (JPY), and the Swiss franc (CHF), for which the cessation or loss of representativeness was December 31, 2021. As for USD LIBOR, for which the cessation or loss of representativeness is planned for June 30, 2023, the Bank included rate replacement clauses in contracts negotiated during 2021 and, since January 1, 2022, the Bank has no longer been using USD LIBOR in new contracts except in circumstances compliant with regulatory guidance. On December 16, 2021, the Bank of Canada announced that a white paper published by the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate (CARR) Working Group was recommending that CDOR (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate) be declared unrepresentative by its administrator, namely, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited (Refinitiv) and that CDOR cease to exist as of June 30, 2024 (including a recommendation to cease using CDOR on the derivative financial instrument market as of June 30, 2023).\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "On January 31, 2022, Refinitiv launched a public consultation on the future of CDOR. The consultation ended on March 2, 2022, after which Refinitiv published an update to the consultation on April 14, 2022. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv published the consultation conclusions and announced that the publication of CDOR would cease as of June 28, 2024. Following this announcement, the CARR Working Group welcomed Refinitiv's decision and, at the same time, OSFI published its prudential expectations regarding the cessation of CDOR. First, OSFI expects all new derivative contracts and securities to transition to alternative reference rates by June 30, 2023, with no new CDOR exposure being recorded after that date, with limited exceptions for risk mitigation requirements. Thereafter, by June 28, 2024, OSFI expects federally regulated financial institutions to have transitioned all loan agreements referencing CDOR to alternative reference rates.\n\nTo prepare for the interest rate benchmark reform, the Bank developed an enterprise-wide project, put together a dedicated team of experts, established a formal governance structure, and prepared a training plan, and several committees were created to ensure the success of the project. The project team is made up of qualified resources from various fields of expertise to ensure a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of the changes as well as the financial, legal, operational, and technological impacts. Many of these experts, who have in-depth knowledge of accounting standards and reform-related activities, are involved in various working groups and participate in meetings with OSFI. The project team regularly reports on the project's progress to the project steering committee and the Financial Markets Risk Committee. As at October 31, 2022, the project was progressing according to schedule. The Bank is exposed to several risks, including interest rate risk and operational risk, which arise from non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities, and derivative financial instruments. The project team ensures that risks are mitigated while ensuring a positive experience for its clients. The Bank is taking all necessary steps to identify, measure, and control all of the risks to ensure a smooth transition throughout the interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe following table discloses the non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities, and derivative financial instruments subject to the interest rate benchmark reform as at October 31, 2022 that have not yet transitioned to alternative benchmark rates.\n\n|                                                     | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   C CDDOORR   U USSDD  LLIIBBOORR   M Maattuurriinngg  aafftteerr   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   C CDDOORR   U USSDD  LLIIBBOORR   M Maattuurriinngg  aafftteerr   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | M Maattuurriinngg  aafftteerr   J Juunnee  2288,,  22002244                                                       | J Juunnee  3300,,  22002233                                                                                       |\n| Non-derivative financial assets (1)                 | 1 133,,998899                                                                                                     | 5 5,,556655                                                                                                       |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities (2)            | 1 111,,110077                                                                                                     | 3 366                                                                                                             |\n| Notional amount of derivative financial instruments | 3 37799,,553399                                                                                                   | 1 17755,,448899                                                                                                   |\n\n## A Accccoouunnttiinngg  PPoolliiccyy  CChhaannggeess\n\n## C Clloouudd  CCoommppuuttiinngg  AArrrraannggeemmeennttss  --  FFiinnaall  AAggeennddaa  DDeecciissiioonn  bbyy  IIFFRRIICC\n\nIn April 2021, IFRIC issued a final agenda decision on accounting for the costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's software as part of a cloud computing or SaaS (Software as a Service) arrangement. The main conclusion was that, if the incurred configuration or customization costs do not give rise to an intangible asset that is separate from the software or if the services received are distinct from the software, those costs are expensed as incurred. IFRIC decided that the relevant accounting standards (IAS 38 - Intangible Assets and IFRS 15 - Revenue From Contracts With Customers) contain sufficient guidance and that the conclusions, as indicated in the final agenda decision, are part of the interpretation of IFRS. As such, any change arising from these interpretations must be accounted for as a retrospectively applied accounting policy change in accordance with IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Bank completed an assessment of the impacts of this change in accounting policy. The change was applied retrospectively and had the following impacts on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \uf0b7 As at November 1, 2020: A $186 million decrease in Intangible assets, a $49 million increase in Other assets - Deferred tax assets, and a $137 million decrease in Retained earnings;\n- \uf0b7 As at October 31, 2021: A $50 million decrease in Intangible assets and a $13 million increase in Other assets - Deferred tax assets;\n- \uf0b7 For the year ended October 31, 2021: A $50 million increase in Non-interest expenses - Technology, a $13 million decrease in Income taxes, a $37 million decrease in Net income and Net income attributable to common shareholders, and a $0.11 decrease in Earnings per share - Basic and diluted.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, the impacts of this accounting policy change on the Consolidated Statement of Income consisted of a $10 million increase in Non-interest expenses - Technology and a $3 million decrease in Income taxes.",

Furthermore, certain accounting policies require complex judgments and estimates because they apply to matters that are inherently uncertain, in particular accounting policies applicable to the following: the fair value determination of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, the impairment of non-financial assets, pension plans and other postemployment benefits, income taxes, provisions, the consolidation of structured entities, and the classification of debt instruments. Descriptions of these judgments and estimates are provided in each of the notes related thereto in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could therefore differ from these estimates, in which case the impacts are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of future fiscal periods. The accounting policies described in this note provide greater detail about the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on judgment.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the geopolitical context, disrupted supply chains, and rising inflation are persisting and creating uncertainty. Therefore, developing reliable estimates and applying judgment continue to be substantially complex. The uncertainty surrounding certain key inputs used in measuring expected credit losses is described in Note 7 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## B Baassiiss  ooff  CCoonnssoolliiddaattiioonn\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Bank. A structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nManagement must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank must consolidate an entity. The Bank controls an entity only if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- \uf0b7 it has decision-making authority regarding the entity's relevant activities;\n- \uf0b7 it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \uf0b7 it has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the returns.\n\nWhen determining decision-making authority, the Bank considers many factors, including the existence and effect of actual and potential voting rights held by the Bank that can be exercised as well as the holding of instruments that are convertible into voting shares. In addition, the Bank must determine whether, as an investor with decision-making rights, it acts as a principal or agent.\n\nBased on these principles, an assessment of control is performed at the inception of a relationship between any entity and the Bank. When performing this assessment, the Bank considers all facts and circumstances, and it must reassess whether it still controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the three conditions of control have changed.\n\nThe Bank consolidates the entities it controls from the date on which control is obtained and ceases to consolidate them from the date control ceases. The Bank uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from a third party on the date control is obtained.\n\n## Non-Controlling Interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity interests held by third parties in the Bank's subsidiaries and are presented in total Equity, separately from Equity attributable to the Bank's shareholders and holders of other equity instruments. The non-controlling interests' proportionate shares of the net income and other comprehensive income of the Bank's subsidiaries are presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, respectively.\n\nWith respect to units issued to third parties by mutual funds and certain other funds that are consolidated, they are presented at fair value in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lastly, changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognized as equity transactions. The difference between the adjustment in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in Equity attributable to the Bank's shareholders and holders of other equity instruments.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nThe Bank exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. The Bank has joint control when there is a contractually agreed sharing of control of an entity, and joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments in associates, i.e., entities over which the Bank exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures, i.e., entities over which the Bank has rights to the net assets and exercises joint control, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and, following acquisition, the Bank's proportionate shares in the net income and in the other comprehensive income are recognized, respectively, in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The carrying value of the investment is adjusted by an equivalent amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reduced by distributions received.\n\n## T Trraannssllaattiioonn  ooff  FFoorreeiiggnn  CCuurrrreenncciieess\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency. Each foreign operation within the Bank's scope of consolidation determines its own functional currency, and the items reported in the financial statements of each foreign operation are measured using that currency.\n\nMonetary items and non-monetary items measured at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at historical rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except for equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income, for which unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated into the Bank's functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, whereas the revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated into the Bank's functional currency at the average exchange rates for the period. Any goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a foreign operation that does not have the same functional currency as the parent company, and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Unrealized translation gains and losses related to foreign operations, including the impact of hedges and income taxes on the related results, are presented in Other comprehensive income. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, any accumulated translation gains and losses, along with the related hedges, recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income item of this foreign operation, are reclassified to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## C Cllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  aanndd  MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss\n\nAt initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFor the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWhen classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the relevant evidence available to the Bank at the date of determination.",

When the Bank's objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank's objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a 'hold to collect' business model or a 'hold to collect and sell' business model.\n\n## Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss\n\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if certain conditions are met. The Bank may apply this option if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases, and if the fair values are reliable. Financial assets thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nA financial liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized. Financial liabilities thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Other comprehensive income unless these changes create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in Net income. Fair value changes not attributable to the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income will not be subsequently reclassified to Net income. Interest expense arising from these financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in the Net interest income item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following cases:\n\n- \uf0b7 if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities on different bases, and if the fair values are reliable;\n- \uf0b7 if a group of financial assets and financial liabilities to which an instrument belongs is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Bank's documented risk management or investment strategy, and information is provided on that basis to senior management. Consequently, the Bank may use this option if it has implemented a documented risk management strategy to manage a group of financial instruments together on the fair value basis, if it can demonstrate that significant financial risks are eliminated or significantly reduced, and if the fair values are reliable;\n- \uf0b7 for hybrid financial instruments with one or more embedded derivatives that would significantly modify the cash flows of the financial instruments and that would otherwise be bifurcated and accounted for separately.\n\n## Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nAt initial recognition, an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration recognized in a business combination may be irrevocably designated as being at fair value through other comprehensive income. In accordance with this designation, any change in fair value is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification to net income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nSecurities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include: (i) debt securities for which the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model and (ii) equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains and losses to net income.\n\nThe Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through other comprehensive income on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. Interest income and dividend income are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Debt Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of expected credit losses and income taxes, and provided that they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in Other comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest income - Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized to interest income over the expected life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Transaction costs incurred upon the purchase of such equity securities are not reclassified to net income upon the sale of the securities.\n\n## Securities Measured at Amortized Cost\n\nSecurities measured at amortized cost include debt securities for which the contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a 'hold to collect' business model.\n\nThe Bank recognizes these securities transactions at fair value on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized.

Changes in fair value between the trade date and the settlement date are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nSecurities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value. Interest income, any transaction costs, as well as realized and unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading are recognized in Non-interest income - Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income on securities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The dividend income and interest income on these financial assets are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Obligations Related to Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements, and Securities Borrowed and Loaned\n\nThe Bank recognizes these transactions at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, except when they are designated at fair value through profit or loss and are recorded at fair value. These transactions are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Securities sold under repurchase agreements remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions.\n\nThe Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral pledged or received in the form of cash is recognized in financial assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhen the collateral is pledged or received in the form of cash, the interest income and expense are recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

These loans are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All loans originated by the Bank are recognized when cash is advanced to a borrower. Purchased loans are recognized when the cash consideration is paid by the Bank.\n\nAll loans are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable costs and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, net of allowances for expected credit losses. For purchased performing loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. For purchased credit-impaired loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan consists of management's estimate of the shortfall of principal and interest cash flows that the Bank expects to collect and of the time value of money. The time value of money component of the fair value adjustment is amortized to interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. Loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Loans Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss\n\nLoans classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, loans designated at fair value through profit or loss, and loans for which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The interest income on loans at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nChanges in the fair value of loans classified as at fair value through profit or loss and loans designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in Non-interest income - Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. With respect to loans whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income - Other in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Reclassification of Financial Assets\n\nA financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument or a financial asset that, at initial recognition, was designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, is reclassified only in rare situations, i.e., when there is a change in the business model used to manage the financial asset. The reclassification is applied prospectively from the reclassification date.\n\n## E Essttaabblliisshhiinngg  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price).\n\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets, based on bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities, provide the best evidence of fair value. A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhen there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is terminated before maturity.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "In certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair value but that are not included in the measurement techniques due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are not limited to, the unobservable nature of the inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or valuation model risk, and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration that is below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient volume of transactions in a given market. The measurement adjustments also include the funding valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions.\n\nAs permitted when certain criteria are met, the Bank has elected to determine fair value based on net exposure to credit risk or market risk for certain portfolios of financial instruments, mainly derivative financial instruments.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Bank applies a three-stage impairment approach to measure the expected credit losses (ECL) on all debt instruments measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and on loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at fair value. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and future economic conditions.\n\n## Determining the Stage\n\nThe ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, is recorded. When there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of a financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset occurs, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime expected credit losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3.\n\n## Assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking information to assess deterioration in the credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment.\n\n## Measurement of Expected Credit Losses\n\nECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. Cash shortfalls represent the difference between all contractual cash flows owed to the Bank and all cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.\n\nThe measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD). Forwardlooking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) are incorporated into the risk parameters. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. Probability weights are assigned to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and subject to management review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process.",

In the case of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income  with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Allowances for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are not measured at fair value are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired Financial Assets\n\nOn initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank determines whether the asset is credit-impaired. For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than the ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## Definition of Default\n\nThe definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following dates: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due.\n\n## Write-Offs\n\nA financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances owing are not likely to be recovered.\n\n## DDeerreeccooggnniittiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  aanndd  SSeeccuurriittiizzaattiioonn\n\nA financial asset is considered for derecognition when the Bank has transferred contractual rights to receive the cash flows or assumed an obligation to transfer these cash flows to a third party. The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when it considers that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have been transferred or when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset expire. When the Bank considers that it has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset and, if applicable, recognizes a financial liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If, due to a derivative financial instrument, the transfer of a financial asset does not result in derecognition, the derivative financial instrument is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhen the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial asset it no longer controls. Any rights and obligations retained following the asset transfer are recognized separately as an asset or liability. If the Bank retains control of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset, i.e., the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nTo diversify its funding sources, the Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the MortgageBacked Securities Program under the National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. Under the first program, the Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgages and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT). As part of these transactions, the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership of the mortgage loans sold. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans securitized under the CMB program continue to be recognized in the Loans item of the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the liabilities for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Moreover, insured mortgage loans securitized and retained by the Bank continue to be recognized in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## D Deerreeccooggnniittiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  LLiiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation is discharged, cancelled, or expires.

Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are included in assets, whereas derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value are included in liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where there are offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative financial instruments is reported either as an asset or as a liability, depending on the circumstance.\n\n## Embedded Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host, the effect being that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided, in the case of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific to one of the parties to the contract.\n\nA derivative embedded in a financial liability is separated from the host contract and treated as a separate derivative if, and only if, the following three conditions are met: the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, the embedded derivative is a separate instrument that meets the definition of a derivative financial instrument, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEmbedded derivatives that are separately accounted for are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In general, all embedded derivatives are presented on a combined basis with the host contract. However, certain embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract are presented in Derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Held-for-Trading Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses (including interest income and expense) are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\n## Policy\n\nThe purpose of a hedging transaction is to modify the Bank's exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting ensures that offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period or periods.\n\n## Documenting and Assessing Effectiveness\n\nThe Bank designates and formally documents each hedging relationship, at its inception, by detailing the risk management objective and the hedging strategy. The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability, or cash flows being hedged, the related hedging instrument, the nature of the specific risk exposure or exposures being hedged, the intended term of the hedging relationship, and the method for assessing the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship. At the inception of the hedging relationship, and for every financial reporting period for which the hedge has been designated, the Bank ensures that the hedging relationship is highly effective and consistent with its originally documented risk management objective and strategy. When a hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting requirements, it is designated as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a foreign exchange hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.",

The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted based on the effective portion of the gains or losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The resulting ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe Bank prospectively discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank revokes the designation. When the designation is revoked, the hedged item is no longer adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, and the amounts previously recorded as cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are amortized using the effective interest rate method and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or terminated before maturity, the cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are immediately recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge variable cash flows attributable to the hedged risk related to a financial asset or liability (or to a group of financial assets or liabilities). The effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive income, whereas the ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income of the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank cancels that designation, then the amounts previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nDerivative and non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge foreign exchange risk related to investments made in foreign operations whose functional currency is not the Canadian dollar. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive income, whereas the ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon the total or partial sale of a net investment in a foreign operation, amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified, in whole or in part, to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## O Offffsseettttiinngg  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  aanndd  LLiiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

For additional information about the accounting treatment of right-of-use assets, see the Leases section presented below.\n\nBuildings, computer equipment, and equipment and furniture are systematically depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation period for leasehold improvements is the lesser of the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements or the non-cancellable period of the lease.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. When the Bank is a lessee, it recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date except for short-term leases (defined as leases with terms of 12 months or less) other than real estate leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For such leases, the Bank recognizes the lease payments as a non-interest expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a practical expedient, the Bank elected, for real estate leases, not to separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for them as a single lease component. When the Bank is the lessor, the leased assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported in Premises and equipment, and the rental income is recognized net of related expenses in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of lease liabilities. The cost of a right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, and an estimate of costs to dismantle the asset or restore the site, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. Right-of-use assets are presented in Premises and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The depreciation expense and impairment losses, if any, are recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments net of lease incentives not yet received. The present value of lease payments is determined using the Bank's incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. In determining the lease term, the Bank considers all the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option. The lease term determined by the Bank comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contracts, the periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Bank is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The Bank reassesses the lease term if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs and that is within its control. The Bank applies judgment to determine the lease term when the lease contains extension and termination options. Lease liabilities are presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the interest expense is presented in the Interest expense - Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the transaction costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Bank acquires control of a business, all of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, including intangible assets, are recorded at fair value. The interests previously held in the acquiree are also measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration and all previously held interests over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. If the fair value of the identifiable net assets exceeds the purchase consideration and all previously held interests, the difference is immediately recognized in income as a gain on a bargain purchase.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Bank's ownership interest and can be initially measured at either fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The measurement basis is selected on a case-by-case basis. Following an acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the value assigned to those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of the acquisition.\n\n## I Innttaannggiibbllee  AAsssseettss\n\n## Intangible Assets With Finite Useful Lives\n\nSoftware that is not part of a cloud computing arrangement and certain other intangible assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

The amortization expense is recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Intangible Assets With Indefinite Useful Lives\n\nThe Bank's intangible assets with indefinite useful lives come from the acquisition of subsidiaries or groups of assets and consist of management contracts and a trademark. They are recognized at the acquisition-date fair value. The management contracts are for the management of open-ended funds. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank reviews the useful lives to determine whether facts and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment. Intangible assets are deemed to have an indefinite useful life following an examination of all relevant factors, in particular: (a) the contracts do not have contractual maturities; (b) the stability of the business segment to which the intangible assets belong; (c) the Bank's capacity to control the future economic benefits of the intangible assets; and (d) the continued economic benefits generated by the intangible assets.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nPremises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs will be determined. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected future cash flows, discount rates, and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant impact on income.\n\nCorporate assets, such as the head office building and computer equipment, do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Therefore, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management has decided to dispose of the asset. However, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU or group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and that recoverable amount is compared with the carrying amount of this CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or group of CGUs. For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting from a business combination must be allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must represent the lowest level for which the goodwill is monitored internally at the Bank and must not be larger than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU or group of CGUs involves management's judgment. If an impairment loss is to be recognized, the Bank does so by first reducing the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs and then reducing the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill must be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased, given that the impairment loss was reversed, but shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for this asset in previous years.\n\n## P Prroovviissiioonnss\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank's best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. Provisions are presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  IInnccoommee  aanndd  EExxppeennssee\n\nInterest income and expense, except for the interest income on securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in Net interest income and calculated using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through the expected life of a financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets and financial assets that were not impaired upon their purchase or origination but became impaired thereafter. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Bank applies the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The credit-adjusted effective interest rate reflects expected credit losses. As for loans that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount (net of allowances for credit losses) rather than to the carrying amount.\n\nLoan origination fees, including commitment, restructuring, and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan. They are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Direct costs for originating a loan are netted against the loan origination fees. If it is likely that a commitment will result in a loan, commitment fees receive the same accounting treatment, i.e., they are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Otherwise, they are recorded in Non-interest income over the term of the commitment.\n\nLoan syndication fees are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Certain mortgage loan prepayment fees are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income when earned.\n\n## D Diivviiddeenndd  IInnccoommee\n\nDividends from an equity instrument are recognized in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the Bank's right to receive payment is established.",

The revenue may therefore be recognized at a point in time, upon completion of the service, or over time as services are provided.\n\nThe Bank must also determine whether its performance obligation is to provide the service itself or to arrange for another party to provide the service (in other words, whether the Bank is acting as a principal or agent). A principal may itself satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified good or service or it may engage another party to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its behalf. A principal also has the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service to the customer and has discretion in establishing the price for the service. If the Bank is acting as a principal, revenue is recognized on a gross basis in an amount corresponding to the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled. If the Bank is acting as an agent, then revenue is recognized net of the service fees and other costs incurred in relation to the commission and fees earned.\n\n## Underwriting and Advisory Fees\n\nUnderwriting and advisory fees include underwriting fees, financial advisory fees, and loan syndication fees. These fees are mainly earned in the Financial Markets segment and are recognized at a point in time as revenue upon successful completion of the engagement. Financial advisory fees are fees earned for assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Loan syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging, and administering a loan syndication and are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan.\n\n## Securities Brokerage Commissions\n\nSecurities brokerage commissions are earned in the Wealth Management segment and are recognized when the transaction is executed.\n\n## Mutual Fund Revenues\n\nMutual fund revenues include management fees earned in the Wealth Management segment. Management fees are primarily calculated based on a fund's net asset value and are recorded in the period the services are performed.\n\n## Investment Management and Trust Service Fees\n\nInvestment management and trust service fees include management fees, trust service fees, and fees for other investment services provided to clients and earned in the Wealth Management segment. Generally, these fees are calculated using the balances of assets under administration and assets under management. Such fees are recognized in the period the service is performed.\n\n## Card Revenues\n\nCard revenues are earned in the Personal and Commercial segment and include card fees such as annual and transactional fees as well as interchange fees. Interchange fees are recognized when a card transaction is settled. Card fees are recognized on the transaction date except for annual fees, which are recorded evenly throughout the year. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to interchange fees.\n\n## Credit Fees and Deposit and Payment Service Charges\n\nCredit fees and deposit and payment service charges are earned in the Personal and Commercial, Financial Markets, and U.S. Specialty Finance and International segments. Credit fees include commissions earned by providing services for loan commitments, financial guarantee contracts, bankers' acceptances, and letters of credit and guarantee, and they are generally recognized in income over the period the services are provided. Deposit and payment service charges include fees related to account maintenance activities and transaction-based service charges. Fees related to account maintenance activities are recognized in the period the services are provided, whereas transaction-based service charges are recognized when the transaction is executed.\n\n## I Innssuurraannccee  RReevveennuueess\n\nInsurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, are arrangements under which one party accepts significant insurance risk by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event was to occur. Gross premiums, net of premiums transferred under reinsurance contracts, are recognized when they become due. Royalties received from reinsurers are recognized when earned. Claims are recognized when received and an amount is estimated as they are being processed. All these amounts are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nUpon recognition of a premium, a reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized, respectively, in Other assets and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent changes in the carrying values of the reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates prevailing on the reporting date, and any adjustments recognized in the period for the current tax of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability.\n\nDeferred tax is established based on temporary differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, in accordance with enacted or substantively enacted income tax laws and rates that will apply on the date the differences reverse. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences related to the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 the initial accounting of goodwill;\n- \uf0b7 the initial accounting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting income nor taxable income;\n- \uf0b7 investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and that the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference;\n- \uf0b7 investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and that there will not be taxable income to which the temporary difference can be recognized.\n\nDeferred tax assets are tax benefits in the form of deductions that the Bank may claim to reduce its taxable income in future years. At the end of each reporting period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is revised, and it is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets and liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities that intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities based on their net amount.\n\nThe Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process involves estimating the actual amount of current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of items reported for accounting and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current information.\n\nThe Bank is subject to the jurisdictions of various tax authorities. In the normal course of its business, the Bank is involved in a number of transactions for which the tax impacts are uncertain. As a result, the Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the tax risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. The amounts of these provisions reflect the best possible estimates of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. The provisions are estimated at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that, at a future date, a provision might need to be adjusted following an audit by the tax authorities. When the final assessment differs from the initially provisioned amounts, the difference will impact the income taxes of the period in which the assessment was made.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  GGuuaarraanntteeee  CCoonnttrraaccttss\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract or indemnification agreement that could require the Bank to make specified payments (in cash, financial instruments, other assets, Bank shares, or provisions of services) to reimburse a beneficiary in the event of a loss resulting from a debtor defaulting on the original or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nTo reflect the fair value of an obligation assumed at the inception of a financial guarantee, a liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. After initial recognition, the Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the allowance for credit losses, determined using the ECL model, and of the initially recognized amount less, where applicable, the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. This revenue is recognized in Credit fees in the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

The Bank also offers other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The other post-employment benefit plans include post-employment medical, dental, and life insurance coverage. The defined benefit component of the pension plans is funded, whereas the defined contribution component of the pension plans and of the other postemployment benefit plans are not funded.\n\n## Defined Benefit Component of the Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans\n\nPlan expenses and obligations are actuarially determined based on the projected benefit method prorated on service. The calculations incorporate management's best estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and retirement age.\n\nThe net asset or net liability related to these plans are calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the present value of the future benefits earned by employees for current and prior-period service and the fair value of plan assets. The net asset or net liability is included in either the Other assets or Other liabilities item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe expense related to these plans consists of the following items: current service cost, net interest on the net plan asset or liability, administration costs, and past service cost, if any, recognized when a plan is amended. This expense is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The net amount of interest income and expense is determined by applying a discount rate to the net plan asset or liability amount.\n\nRemeasurements of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans represent actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net plan asset or liability amount. Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive income and are not subsequently reclassified to net income; these cumulative gains and losses are reclassified to Retained earnings.\n\n## Defined Contribution Component of the Pension Plans\n\nThe expense for these plans is equivalent to the Bank's contributions during the period and is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## SShhaarree--BBaasseedd  PPaayymmeennttss\n\nThe Bank has several share-based compensation plans: the Stock Option Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan, the Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plan, the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan, the Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of National Bank Financial, and the Employee Share Ownership Plan.\n\nCompensation expense is recognized over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the award. This period is generally the same as the vesting period, except where the required service period begins before the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees eligible to retire on the award date is immediately recognized on the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees who will become eligible to retire during the vesting period is recognized over the period from the award date to the date the employee becomes eligible to retire. For all of these plans, as of the first year of recognition, the expense includes cancellation and forfeiture estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised, as necessary. The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with some of these plans. The compensation expense for these plans, net of related hedges, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nUnder the Stock Option Plan, the Bank uses the fair value method to account for stock options awarded. The options vest at 25% per year, and each tranche is treated as though it was a separate award. The fair value of each of the tranches is measured on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and this fair value is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits and Contributed surplus. When the options are exercised, the Contributed surplus amount is credited to Equity - Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds received from the employees when these options are exercised are also credited to Equity - Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nSARs are recorded at fair value when awarded, and their fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until they are exercised. The cost is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligation that results from the change in fair value at each period is recognized in net income gradually over the vesting period, and periodically thereafter, until the SARs are exercised.  When a SAR is exercised, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the increase in the stock price since the date of the award.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date. For the PSU Plan, the change in the obligation attributable to changes in the share price, adjusted upward or downward depending on the relative result of the performance criteria, and the change in the obligation attributable to dividends paid on the shares awarded under the plan, are recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period in which the changes occur.

IFRS 17 introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. IFRS 17 provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 will affect how an entity accounts for its insurance contracts and how it reports financial performance in the consolidated income statement, in particular the timing of revenue recognition for insurance contracts. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 that included a two-year deferral of the effective date along with other changes aimed at addressing concerns and implementation challenges identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017. IFRS 17, as amended, is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. If full retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach may be used.\n\nTo prepare for the application of IFRS 17, the Bank developed a project, set up a specialized team, and established a formal governance structure. It also started executing a detailed plan for the project that defines key activities and the timing of those activities. The project is progressing according to schedule. The Bank is continuing to assess all of the impacts of applying IFRS 17 on its consolidated financial statements as well as on the financial statements of its insurance subsidiary.",

When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank applies other valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and that minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Such valuation techniques include the following: using information available from recent market transactions, referring to the current fair value of a comparable financial instrument, applying discounted cash flow analysis, applying option pricing models, or relying on any other valuation technique that is commonly used by market participants and has proven to yield reliable estimates. Judgment is required when applying many of the valuation techniques. The Bank's valuation was based on its assessment of the conditions prevailing as at October 31, 2022 and may change in the future. Furthermore, there may be measurement uncertainty resulting from the choice of valuation model used.",

The Bank has policies and procedures that govern the process for determining fair value. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All valuation models are validated, and controls have been implemented to ensure that they are applied.\n\nThe fair value of existing or new products is determined and validated by functions independent of the risk-taking team. Complex fair value matters are reviewed by valuation committees made up of experts from various specialized functions.\n\nFor financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Bank has documented the hierarchy classification policies, and controls are in place to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, reliably, and consistently. Valuation methods and the underlying assumptions are regularly reviewed.\n\n## V Vaalluuaattiioonn  MMeetthhooddss  aanndd  AAssssuummppttiioonnss\n\n## Financial Instruments Whose Fair Value Equals Carrying Value\n\nThe carrying value of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 cash and deposits with financial institutions;\n- \uf0b7 securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed;\n- \uf0b7 obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned;\n- \uf0b7 customers' liability under acceptances;\n- \uf0b7 acceptances;\n- \uf0b7 certain items of other assets and other liabilities.\n\n## Securities and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short\n\nThese financial instruments, except for securities at amortized cost, are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Their fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets, i.e., bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities. If there are no quoted prices in an active market, fair value is estimated using prices for securities that are substantially the same. If such prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices, the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, credit risk, interest rate yield curves, and currency rates.\n\nWhen one or more significant inputs are not observable in the markets, fair value is established primarily using internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the characteristics specific to the financial asset or liability, and other relevant factors.\n\n## Securities Issued or Guaranteed by Governments\n\nSecurities issued or guaranteed by governments include government debt securities of the governments of Canada (federal, provincial and municipal) as well as debt securities of the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury), of other U.S. agencies, and of other foreign governments. The fair value of these securities is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. For those classified in Level 2, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets are used to determine fair value. In the absence of an observable market, a valuation technique such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities.\n\n## Equity Securities and Other Debt Securities\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is determined primarily by using quoted prices in active markets. For equity securities and other debt securities classified in Level 2, a valuation technique based on quoted prices of identical and similar instruments in an active market is used to determine fair value. In the absence of observable inputs, a valuation technique such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. For those classified in Level 3, fair value can be determined based on net asset value, which represents the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from investment or fund managers or the general partners of limited partnerships. Fair value can also be determined using internal valuation techniques adjusted to reflect financial instrument risk factors and economic conditions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For exchange-traded derivative financial instruments, fair value is based on quoted prices in an active market.\n\nFor over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments, fair value is determined using well established valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices and the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, currency rates as well as price and rate volatility factors. In establishing the fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments, the Bank also incorporates the following factors:\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)\n\nThe CVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. For each counterparty, the CVA is based on the expected positive exposure and probabilities of default through time. The exposures are determined by using relevant factors such as current and potential future market values, master netting agreements, collateral agreements, and expected recovery rates. The default probabilities are inferred using credit default swap (CDS) spreads. When such information is unavailable, relevant proxies are used. While the general methodology currently assumes independence between expected positive exposures and probabilities of default, adjustments are applied to certain types of transactions where there is a direct link between the exposure at default and the default probabilities.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)\n\nThe FVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market-implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. The expected exposures are determined using methodologies consistent with the CVA framework. The funding level used to determine the FVA is based on the average funding level of relevant market participants.\n\nWhen the valuation techniques incorporate one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the markets, the fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the characteristics specific to the financial asset or financial liability, and other relevant factors.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows, adjusted for several factors, including prepayment options, current market interest rates for similar loans, and other relevant variables where applicable. The fair value of variable-rate mortgage loans is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\nThe fair value of other fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates charged for similar new loans. The fair value of other variable-rate loans is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe fair value of fixed-term deposits is determined primarily by discounting expected future contractual cash flows and considering several factors such as redemption options and market interest rates currently offered for financial instruments with similar conditions. For certain term funding instruments, fair value is determined using market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of demand deposits and notice deposits is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\nThe fair value of structured deposit notes is established using valuation models that maximize the use of observable inputs when available, such as benchmark indices, and also incorporates the Bank's own credit risk. In calculating the Bank's own credit risk, the market implied spreads of the Bank are used to infer its probabilities of default. Lastly, when fair value is determined using option pricing models, the valuation techniques are similar to those described for derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Liabilities Related to Transferred Receivables\n\nThese liabilities arise from sale transactions to Canada Housing Trust (CHT) of securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. These transactions do not qualify for derecognition. They are recorded as guaranteed borrowings, which results in the recording of liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these liabilities is established using valuation techniques based on observable market inputs such as Canada Mortgage Bond prices.",

If there is no active market, fair value is determined by discounting contractual cash flows using the current market interest rates offered for similar financial instruments that have the same term to maturity.\n\n## H Hiieerraarrcchhyy  ooff  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  MMeeaassuurreemmeennttss\n\n## D Deetteerrmmiinniinngg  tthhee  LLeevveellss  ooff  tthhee  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  HHiieerraarrcchhyy\n\nIFRS establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. This fair value hierarchy requires observable market inputs to be used whenever such inputs exist. According to the hierarchy, the highest level of inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and the lowest level of inputs are unobservable inputs. If inputs from different levels of the hierarchy are used, the financial instrument is classified in the same level as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value measurement hierarchy has the following levels:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n\n## Level 2\n\nValuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and certain other liabilities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nValuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs.\n\nFinancial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss: investments in hedge funds for which there are certain restrictions on unit or security redemptions, equity securities and debt securities of private companies, as well as certain derivative financial instruments whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs;\n- \uf0b7 securities at fair value through other comprehensive income: equity and debt securities of private companies;\n- \uf0b7 certain loans and certain deposits (structured deposit notes) whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs;\n- \uf0b7 certain other assets for which fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs.\n\n## TTrraannssffeerrss  BBeettwweeeenn  tthhee  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  HHiieerraarrcchhyy  LLeevveellss\n\nTransfers of financial instruments between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers to (or from) Level 3 are deemed to have taken place at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Significant transfers can occur between the fair value hierarchy levels due to new information on inputs used to determine fair value and the observable nature of those inputs.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, $41 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $3 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 as a result of changing market conditions ($31 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $2 million in obligations related to securities sold short in fiscal 2021). In addition, during fiscal 2022, $26 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $2 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 as a result of changing market conditions (for fiscal 2021, $30 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, financial instruments were transferred to (or from) Level 3 due to changes in the availability of observable market inputs as a result of changing market conditions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The net asset value of a fund is the total fair value of assets less liabilities.\n\n## EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) Multiple and Price Equivalent\n\nPrivate equity valuation inputs include earnings multiples, which are determined based on comparable companies, and a higher multiple will translate into a higher fair value. Price equivalent is a percentage of the market price based on the liquidity of the security.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rate is the input used to bring future cash flows to their present value. A higher discount rate will translate into a lower fair value.\n\n## Liquidity Premium\n\nA liquidity premium may be applied when few or no transactions exist to support the valuations. A higher liquidity premium will result in a lower value.\n\n## Long-Term Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the expected future variability of market prices. Volatility is generally observable in the market through options prices. However, the long-term volatility of options with a longer maturity might not be observable. An increase (decrease) in long-term volatility is generally associated with an increase (decrease) in long-term correlation. Higher long-term volatility may increase or decrease an instrument's fair value depending on its terms.\n\n## Market Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two different variables. A positive correlation means that the variables tend to move in the same direction; a negative correlation means that the variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to measure financial instruments whose future returns depend on several variables. Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument's fair value depending on the terms of its contractual payout.\n\n## Credit Spread\n\nA credit spread (yield) is the difference between the instrument's yield and a benchmark yield. Benchmark instruments have high credit quality ratings with similar maturities. The credit spread therefore represents the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows of an asset to reflect the market return required for credit quality in the estimated cash flows. A higher credit spread will result in a lower value.\n\n## S Seennssiittiivviittyy  AAnnaallyyssiiss  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss  CCllaassssiiffiieedd  iinn  LLeevveell  33\n\nThe Bank performs sensitivity analyses for the fair value measurements of Level 3 financial instruments, substituting unobservable inputs with one or more reasonably possible alternative assumptions.\n\nFor equity securities and other debt securities, the Bank varies significant unobservable inputs such as net asset values, EV/EBITDA multiples, or price equivalents and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $126 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2022 (a $115 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2021).\n\nFor loans, the Bank varies unobservable inputs such as a liquidity premium and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $31 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2022 (a $28 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2021).\n\nFor derivative financial instruments and embedded derivative financial instruments related to structured deposit notes, the Bank varies long-term volatility and market correlation inputs and establishes a reasonable fair value range. As at October 31, 2022, for derivative financial instruments, the net fair value could result in a $5 million increase or decrease (a $1 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2021), whereas for structured deposit notes, the net fair value could result in a $1 million increase or decrease (no sensitivity analysis as at October 31, 2021 since there were no structured deposit notes classified in Level 3).\n\nFor other assets, the Bank varies unobservable inputs such as discount rates and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $10 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2022 (no sensitivity analysis as at October 31, 2021 since there were no other assets classified in Level 3).\n\nFor all Level 3 financial instruments, the reasonable fair value ranges could result in a 5% increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2022 (a 5% increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2021).\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Consistent with its risk management strategy and in accordance with the fair value option, which permits the designation if it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets and liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses thereon on different bases, the Bank designated certain securities and certain liabilities related to transferred receivables at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of liabilities related to transferred receivables does not include credit risk, as the holders of these liabilities are not exposed to the Bank's credit risk. The Bank also designated certain deposits that include embedded derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTo determine a change in fair value arising from a change in the credit risk of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank calculates, at the beginning of the period, the present value of the instrument's contractual cash flows using the following rates: first, an observed discount rate for similar securities that reflects the Bank's credit spread and, then, a rate that excludes the Bank's credit spread. The difference obtained between the two values is then compared to the difference obtained using the same rates at the end of the period.\n\nInformation about the financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the following tables.\n\n|

If the offsetting criteria are met, these transactions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, as part of these transactions, the Bank may pledge or receive cash or other financial instruments used as collateral.\n\nThe following tables present information on financial assets and financial liabilities that are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, because they meet the offsetting criteria as well as information on those that are not netted and are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement or similar agreement.\n\n|                                               | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   |

The Bank has policies and procedures that govern impairments arising from credit risk. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All models used to calculate expected credit losses are validated, and controls are in place to ensure they are applied.\n\nThese models are validated by groups that are independent of the team that prepares the calculations. Complex questions on measurement methodologies and assumptions are reviewed by a group of experts from various functions. Furthermore, the inputs and assumptions used to determine expected credit losses are regularly reviewed.\n\n## MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  ((EECCLL))\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using three main variables: (1) probability of default (PD), (2) loss given default (LGD) and (3) exposure at default (EAD). For accounting purposes, 12-month PD and lifetime PD are the probabilities of a default occurring over the next 12 months or over the life of a financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and on future economic conditions that have, or will have, an impact on credit risk. LGD reflects the losses expected should default occur and considers such factors as the mitigating effects of collateral, the realizable value thereof, and the time value of money. EAD is the expected balance owing at default and considers such factors as repayments of principal and interest between the balance sheet date and the time of default as well as any amounts expected to be drawn on a committed facility. Twelve-month expected credit losses are estimated by multiplying 12-month PD by LGD and by EAD. Lifetime expected credit losses are estimated using the lifetime PD.\n\nFor most financial instruments, expected credit losses are measured on an individual basis. Financial instruments that have credit losses measured on a collective basis are grouped according to similar credit risk characteristics such as type of instrument, geographic location, comparable risk level, and business sector or industry.\n\n## I Innppuuttss,,  AAssssuummppttiioonnss  aanndd  EEssttiimmaattiioonn  TTeecchhnniiqquueess\n\nThe Bank's approach to calculating expected credit losses consists essentially of leveraging existing regulatory models and then adjusting their parameters for IFRS 9 purposes. These models have the advantage of having been thoroughly tested and validated. In addition, using the same base models, regardless of the purpose, provides consistency across risk assessments. These models use inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques that require a high degree of management judgment. The main factors that contribute to changes in ECL that are subject to significant judgment include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 calibration of regulatory parameters in order to obtain point-in-time and forward-looking parameters;\n- \uf0b7 forecasts of macroeconomic variables for multiple scenarios and the probability weighting of the scenarios;\n- \uf0b7 determination of the significant increases in credit risk (SICR) of a loan.",

The Bank performs the following: (1) A point-in-time calibration, where the PD of the portfolio is aligned with the appropriate default rate. The resulting PD estimate generally equals the prior-year default rate. The prior-year default rate is selected for the calibration performed at this stage, as it often reflects one of the most accurate and appropriate estimates of the current-year default rate; (2) Forward-looking adjustments are incorporated through, among other measures, a calibration factor based on forecasts produced by the stress testing team's analyses. The team considers three macroeconomic scenarios, and, for each scenario, produces a forward-looking assessment covering the three upcoming years.\n\n## LGD Estimates\n\nThe LGD estimation method consists of using, for each of the three macroeconomic scenarios, expected LGD based on the LGD values observed using backtesting, the economic LGD estimated and used to calculate economic capital, and lastly, the estimated downturn LGD used to calculate regulatory capital.\n\n## EAD Estimates\n\nFor term loans, the Bank uses expected EAD, which is the outstanding balance anticipated at each point in time. Expected EAD decreases over time according to contractual repayments and to prepayments. For revolving loans, the EAD percentage is based on the percentage estimated by the corresponding regulatory model and, thereafter, is converted to dollars according to the authorized balance.\n\n## Expected Life\n\nFor most financial instruments, the expected life used when measuring expected credit losses is the remaining contractual life. For revolving financial instruments where there is no contractual maturity, such as credit cards or lines of credit, the expected life is based on the behavioural life of clients who have defaulted or closed their account.\n\n## Incorporation of Forward-Looking Information\n\nThe Bank's Economy and Strategy Group is responsible for developing three macroeconomic scenarios and for recommending probability weights for each scenario. Macroeconomic scenarios are not developed for specific portfolios, as the Economy and Strategy Group provides a set of variables for each of the defined scenarios for the next three years. The PDs are also adjusted to incorporate economic assumptions (interest rates, unemployment rates, GDP forecasts, oil prices, housing price indices, etc.) that can be statistically tied to PD changes that will have an impact beyond the next 12 months. These statistical relationships are determined using the processes developed for stress testing. In addition, the group considers other relevant factors that may not be adequately reflected in the information used to calculate the PDs (including late payments and whether the financial asset is subject to additional monitoring within the watchlist process for business and government loan portfolios).\n\n## Determination of a Significant Increase in the Credit Risk of a Financial Instrument\n\nAt each reporting period, the Bank determines whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by examining the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. First, the Bank compares the point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date with the expected point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD established at initial recognition. Based on this comparison, the Bank determines whether the loan has deteriorated when compared to the initial conditions. Because the comparison includes an adjustment based on origination-date forward-looking information and reporting-date forward-looking information, the deterioration may be caused by the following factors: (i) deterioration of the economic outlook used in the forward-looking assessment; (ii) deterioration of the borrower's conditions (payment defaults, worsening financial ratios, etc.); or (iii) a combination of both factors. The quantitative criteria used to determine a significant increase in credit risk are a series of relative and absolute thresholds, and a backstop is also applied. All financial instruments that are over 30 days past due but below 90 days past due are migrated to Stage 2, even if the other criteria do not indicate a significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  QQuuaalliittyy  ooff  LLooaannss\n\nThe following tables present the gross carrying amounts of loans as at October 31, 2022 and 2021, according to credit quality and ECL impairment stage of each loan category at amortized cost, and according to credit quality for loans at fair value through profit or loss.

        "page_content": "## Note 7 - Loans and Allowances for Credit Losses (cont.)\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2022, the macroeconomic outlook generally deteriorated.\n\nIn the base scenario, the global economy faces a cycle of synchronized monetary tightening designed to curb inflation in a still uncertain geopolitical environment. The Canadian economy is relatively well positioned thanks to a resource sector that is benefitting from higher commodity prices. However, as is the case in other countries, higher interest rates slow the economy. The labour market already shows signs of cooling, and lower hiring intentions do not point to a short-term turnaround. In the housing resale market, a noticeable downtrend persists and home prices continue to decline. In such a scenario, inflation decelerates significantly, enabling the central bank to cease raising its policy rate. All in all, a significant economic slowdown occurs in the coming quarters, as consumers simultaneously deal with a loss in purchasing power, a negative wealth effect, and interest payment shock. After 12 months, the unemployment rate rises a full percentage point to 6.2%. Housing prices slide 11.2% year over year, the S&P/TSX is at 18,500 points after one year, and the price of oil hovers around US$77.\n\nIn the upside scenario, the economy surprises slightly in a positive direction owing to a resilient labour market. Governments continue to support the Canadian and U.S. economies. Consumer spending also surprises to the upside given the excess savings accumulated since the start of the pandemic. While the economy remains solid, the central bank does not need to significantly tighten monetary policy as inflation stabilizes given a normalization of supply chains and easing geopolitical tensions. After one year, the unemployment rate is more favourable than that of the base scenario (seven-tenths lower). Housing prices remain unchanged, the S&P/TSX is at 20,300 points after one year, and the price of oil hovers around US$102.\n\nIn the downside scenario, supply chain issues persist and the geopolitical landscape remains highly uncertain. The global economy stagnates with several countries seeing a drop in economic activity. In addition, central banks underestimated the impact of rising interest rates in a context of persistent supply shock. Given budgetary constraints, governments have a limited capacity to support households and businesses. After 12 months, the economic contraction pushes the unemployment rate to 8.2%. Housing prices decrease considerably, the S&P/TSX slides to 14,380 points after one year, and the price of oil falls to US$36.\n\nGiven uncertainty surrounding the key inputs used to measure credit losses, the Bank has applied expert credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results.\n\n## S Seennssiittiivviittyy  AAnnaallyyssiiss  ooff  AAlllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  oonn  NNoonn--IImmppaaiirreedd  LLooaannss\n\n## S Scceennaarriiooss\n\nThe following table shows a comparison of the Bank's allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans (Stages 1 and 2) as at October 31, 2022 based on the probability weightings of three scenarios with allowances for credit losses resulting from simulations of each scenario weighted at 100%.\n\n|                                                               | A Alllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  ccrreeddiitt  lloosssseess   o onn  nnoonn--iimmppaaiirreedd  llooaannss   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| B Baallaannccee  aass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222 | 8 85577                                                                                                   |\n| S Siimmuullaattiioonnss                                       |                                                                                                           |\n| 100% upside scenario                                          | 6 60033                                                                                                   |\n| 100% base scenario                                            | 6 69933                                                                                                   |\n| 100% downside scenario                                        | 1 1,,112233                                                                                               |\n\n## M Miiggrraattiioonn\n\nThe following table shows a comparison of the Bank's allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans (Stages 1 and 2) as at October 31, 2022 with the estimated allowances for credit losses that would result if all these non-impaired loans were in Stage 1.\n\n| B Baallaannccee  aass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002222   | A Alllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  ccrreeddiitt  lloosssseess   o onn  nnoonn--iimmppaaiirreedd  llooaannss   8 85577   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| S Siimmuullaattiioonnss                                         |                                                                                                                     |\n| Non-impaired loans if they were all in Stage 1                  | 6 66644                                                                                                             |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Where securities are received as collateral, the Bank does not record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  TTrraannssffeerrrreedd  ttoo  SSttrruuccttuurreedd  EEnnttiittiieess\n\nUnder the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program, the Bank sells securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of insured mortgage bonds. Third-party CMB investors have legal recourse only to the transferred assets.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the recoverable value of the CGU or group of CGUs may have fallen below its carrying amount.\n\nGoodwill was tested for impairment during the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, and no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nThe recoverable value of a CGU or group of CGUs is based on the value in use that is calculated based on discounted pre-tax cash flows. Future pre-tax cash flows are estimated based on a five-year period, which is the reference period used for the most recent financial forecasts approved by management. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.\n\nThe discount rate used for each CGU or group of CGUs is calculated using the cost of debt financing and the cost related to the Bank's equity. This rate corresponds to the Bank's weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risk specific to the CGU. The long-term growth rate used in calculating discounted cash flow estimates is based on the forecasted growth rate plus a risk premium. The rate is constant over the entire five-year period for which the cash flows were determined. Growth rates are determined, among other factors, based on past growth rates, economic trends, inflation, competition and the impact of the Bank's strategic initiatives. As at October 31, 2022, for each CGU or CGU group, the discount rate used was 12.9% (13.2% as at October 31, 2021), and the long-term growth rate varied between 2% and 5%, depending on the CGU, as at October 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank conducts sensitivity analyses by varying the after-tax discount rate upward by 1% and the terminal growth rates downward by 1%. Such sensitivity analyses demonstrate that a reasonable change in assumptions would not result in a CGU's carrying value exceeding its value in use.\n\n## I Innttaannggiibbllee  AAsssseettss\n\n|

These regulations provide certain powers to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), notably the power to convert certain eligible Bank shares and liabilities into common shares should the Bank become non-viable.\n\n## CCoovveerreedd  BBoonnddss\n\n## NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership\n\nIn December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. During the year ended October 31, 2022, an amount of 1.0 billion euros and US$1.0 billion in covered bonds reached maturity, and the Bank issued 1.3 billion euros, US$1.5 billion, and 750 million pounds sterling in covered bonds (US$470 million, 1.0 billion euros, and 250 million pounds sterling in covered bonds reached maturity, and the Bank issued 1.25 billion euros in covered bonds during the year ended October 31, 2021). The covered bonds totalled $10.4 billion as at October 31, 2022 ($8.8 billion as at October 31, 2021). For additional information, see Note 27 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Bank has limited access to the assets owned by this structured entity according to the terms of the agreements that apply to this transaction. The assets owned by this entity totalled $18.2 billion as at October 31, 2022 ($16.0 billion as at October 31, 2021), of which $17.9 billion ($15.7 billion as at October 31, 2021) is presented in Residential mortgage loans on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The rights of the Bank's note and debenture holders are subordinate to the claims of depositors and certain other creditors. Approval from OSFI is required before the Bank can redeem its subordinated notes and debentures in whole or in part.\n\nOn August 31, 2022, the Bank redeemed debentures denominated in a foreign currency and maturing on February 28, 2087 in an amount of US$7 million at their nominal value plus accrued interest.\n\nOn July 25, 2022, the Bank issued medium-term notes for an amount of $750 million, bearing interest at 5.426% and maturing on August 16, 2032. The interest on these notes will be payable semi-annually at 5.426% per annum until August 16, 2027 and, thereafter, at a floating rate equal to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate (CORRA) compounded daily plus 2.32% and payable quarterly. With the prior approval of OSFI, the Bank may, at its option, redeem these notes as of August 16, 2027, in whole or in part, at their nominal value plus accrued and unpaid interest. Since the medium-term notes satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\n| As at October 31                |                                                                    | 2 2002222   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| M Maattuurriittyy  ddaattee     | I Inntteerreesstt  rraattee   R Reeddeemmppttiioonn  ddaattee      |             |        |\n| February 2028 (1)               | 3.183% (2) February 1, 2023 (3)                                    | 7 75500     | 750    |\n| August 2032 (1)                 | 5.426% (4) August 16, 2027 (3)                                     | 7 75500     | -      |\n| February 2087                   | Variable   Redeemable at the Bank's option since February 28, 1993 | - -         | 9      |\n|                                 |                                                                    | 1 1,,550000 | 759    |\n| Fair value hedge adjustment (5) |                                                                    | 2 2         | 10     |\n| Unamortized issuance costs (6)  |                                                                    | ( (33))     | (1)    |\n| T Toottaall                     |                                                                    | 1 1,,449999 | 768    |",

Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is subject to the same credit approval, credit limit, and credit monitoring standards as those applied to the Bank's other credit transactions. Consequently, the Bank evaluates the creditworthiness of counterparties and manages the size of the portfolios as well as the diversification and maturity profiles of these financial instruments.\n\nThe Bank limits the credit risk of over-the-counter contracts by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and entering into contracts that provide for the exchange of collateral between parties where the fair value of the outstanding transactions exceeds an agreed threshold. The Bank also negotiates master netting agreements that provide for the simultaneous close-out and settling of all transactions with a given counterparty on a net basis in the event of default, insolvency, or bankruptcy. However, overall exposure to credit risk, reduced through master netting agreements, may change substantially after the balance sheet date because it is affected by all transactions subject to a contract as well as by changes in the market rates of the underlying instruments.\n\nThe Bank also uses financial intermediaries to have access to established clearing houses in order to minimize the settlement risk arising from financial derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank has direct access to clearing houses for settling derivative financial instruments. In addition, certain derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties.\n\nIn the case of exchange-traded contracts, exposure to credit risk is limited because these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established exchanges, each of which is associated with a well-capitalized clearing house that assumes the obligations of both counterparties and guarantees their performance obligations. All exchange-traded contracts are subject to initial margins and daily settlement.\n\n## T Teerrmmss  UUsseedd\n\n## Replacement Cost\n\nReplacement cost is the Bank's maximum credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This amount is the positive fair value of all derivative financial instruments, before all master netting agreements and collateral held.\n\n## Credit Risk Equivalent\n\nThe credit risk equivalent amount is the total replacement cost plus an amount representing the potential future credit risk exposure, as outlined in OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline.\n\n## Risk-Weighted Amount\n\nThe risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the OSFI guidance to the credit risk equivalent.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  EExxppoossuurree  ooff  tthhee  DDeerriivvaattiivvee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeenntt  PPoorrttffoolliioo\n\n| As at October 31                                  |                                     |                                                     | 2 2002222                                           | 2021              | 2021                        | 2021                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                   | R Reeppllaacceemmeenntt   c coosstt | C Crreeddiitt  rriisskk   e eqquuiivvaalleenntt (1) | R Riisskk--   w weeiigghhtteedd   a ammoouunntt (1) | Replacement  cost | Credit risk  equivalent (1) | Risk-  weighted  amount (1) |\n| Interest rate contracts                           | 5 5,,449900                         | 2 2,,663399                                         | 5 50088                                             | 1,975             | 3,239                       | 814                         |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                        | 8 8,,777755                         | 5 5,,992266                                         | 1 1,,884477                                         | 6,453             | 4,361                       | 1,405                       |\n| Equity, commodity and credit derivative contracts | 4 4,,228822                         | 6 6,,556699                                         | 1 1,,779977                                         | 8,056             | 12,113                      | 3,316                       |\n|                                                   | 1 188,,554477                       | 1 155,,113344                                       | 4 4,,115522                                         | 16,484            | 19,713                      | 5,535                       |\n| Impact of master netting agreements               | ( (99,,558833))                     |                                                     |                                                     | (9,398)           |                             |                             |\n|                                                   | 8 8,,996644                         | 1 155,,113344                                       | 4 4,,115522                                         | 7,086             | 19,713                      | 5,535                       |\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  EExxppoossuurree  ooff  tthhee  DDeerriivvaattiivvee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeenntt  PPoorrttffoolliioo  bbyy  CCoouunntteerrppaarrttyy\n\n| As at October 31                     | 2 2002222                           | 2 2002222                                       | 2021              | 2021                    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                      | R Reeppllaacceemmeenntt   c coosstt | C Crreeddiitt  rriisskk   e eqquuiivvaalleenntt | Replacement  cost | Credit risk  equivalent |\n| OECD (1)  member-country governments | 1 1,,334422                         | 2 2,,770000                                     | 771               | 2,604                   |\n| Banks of OECD member countries       | 5 58899                             | 3 3,,229922                                     | 714               | 3,492                   |\n| Other                                | 7 7,,003333                         | 9 9,,114422                                     | 5,601             | 13,617                  |\n|                                      | 8 8,,996644                         | 1 155,,113344                                   | 7,086             | 19,713                  |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments offset changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to portfolios of securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, fixed-rate mortgage loans, fixed-rate deposits, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and subordinated debt.\n\nIn addition, when a fixed-rate asset or liability is denominated in a foreign currency, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the associated foreign exchange risk. The Bank may designate a cross-currency swap to exchange the fixed-rate foreign currency for the functional currency at a floating rate in a single hedging relationship addressing both interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to foreign currency fixed-rate deposits.\n\nRegression analysis is used to test hedge effectiveness and determine the hedge ratio. For fair value hedges, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned.\n\nThe following tables show amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the fair value hedges.\n\n|                                                             | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr

In addition, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk caused by assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to its loan, personal credit line, acceptance, and deposit portfolios as well as liabilities related to transferred receivables.\n\nThe Bank also uses total return swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows related to the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan. Some of these swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge against a portion of the unrecognized obligation of the RSU Plan. In cash flow hedges, the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments reduce the variability of the future cash flows related to the hedged items.\n\nRegression analysis is used to assess hedge effectiveness and to determine the hedge ratio. For cash flow hedges, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned.\n\nThe following tables show the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the cash flow hedges.\n\n|                                                 | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,

The Bank measures this risk by assessing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and hedges it using derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (crosscurrency swaps and deposits). In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), the financial instruments used offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the investments. When non-derivative financial instruments are designated as foreign exchange risk hedges, only the changes in fair value that are attributable to foreign exchange risk are taken into account when assessing and calculating the effectiveness of the hedge.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of net investment hedges consists of comparing changes in the carrying value of the deposits or the fair value of the derivative attributable to exchange rate fluctuations with changes in the net investment in a foreign operation attributable to exchange rate fluctuations. Inasmuch as the notional amount of the hedging instruments and the hedged net investments are aligned, no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nThe following tables present the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the net investment hedges.\n\n|                                                                                                                        | A Ass  aatt

The trust assets consist of Series 44, Series 45 and Series 46 preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 1, LRCN - Series 2 and LRCN - Series 3. In the event of (i) non-payment of interest on any of the interest payment dates, (ii) non-payment of the redemption amount upon redemption of the LRCN, (iii) non-payment of the principal amount upon maturity of the LRCN, or (iv) an event of default in respect of the LRCN, the noteholders will have recourse only to the assets of the trust, and each noteholder will be entitled to its pro rata share of the assets of the trust. In such circumstances, delivery of the assets of the trust will eliminate all of the Bank's obligations with respect to the LRCN. The LRCN - Series 1, LRCN Series 2 and LRCN - Series 3 are redeemable at maturity or earlier to the extent that the Bank redeems the Series 44, Series 45 and Series 46 preferred shares from the date fixed for redemption, and subject to OSFI's consent and approval.\n- (10) The Series 44, Series 45 and Series 46 preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 1, LRCN - Series 2 and LRCN - Series 3 are held by a consolidated limited recourse trust on the Bank's balance sheet and are therefore eliminated for financial reporting purposes. Upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as defined by OSFI; (i) each LRCN will be automatically redeemed and the redemption price will be covered by delivery of the trust's assets that consist of Series 44, Series 45 and Series 46 preferred shares; (ii) each outstanding preferred share will be automatically and immediately converted on a full and permanent basis, without the consent of the holder, into a number of Bank common shares determined pursuant to an automatic conversion formula. This conversion will be calculated by dividing the value of the preferred shares, i.e., $1,000 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid interest as at the date of the trigger event, by the value of the common shares. The value of the common shares will be the greater of a $5.00 floor price or the current market price of the common shares. Current market price means the volume weighted average trading price of common shares for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank's Board.\n\n## Second Preferred Shares\n\n15 million shares without par value, issuable for a maximum aggregate consideration of $300 million.

The trust's assets consist of $500 million of Series 46 first preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 3. The LRCN - Series 3 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.50% per annum until November 16, 2027 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 4.281% until November 16, 2077. The LRCN - Series 3 mature on November 16, 2082.\n\nOn April 21, 2021, the Bank had issued $500 million of LRCN - Series 2 for which recourse of the noteholders is limited to the assets held by an independent trustee in a consolidated limited recourse trust. The trust's assets consist of $500 million of Series 45 first preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 2. The LRCN - Series 2 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.05% per annum until August 15, 2026 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 3.045% until August 15, 2076. The LRCN - Series 2 mature on August 15, 2081.\n\nIn the event of (i) non-payment of interest on any of the interest payment dates, (ii) non-payment of the redemption amount upon redemption of the LRCN, (iii) non-payment of the principal amount upon maturity of the LRCN, or (iv) an event of default in respect of the notes, the noteholders will have recourse only to the assets of the trust, and each noteholder will be entitled to its pro rata share of the assets of the trust. In such circumstances, delivery of the trust's assets will eliminate all of the Bank's obligations with respect to the LRCN. The LRCN - Series 2 and LRCN - Series 3 are redeemable at maturity or earlier to the extent that the Bank redeems the Series 45 and Series 46 preferred shares on certain redemption dates specified in the terms and conditions of said preferred shares, and subject to OSFI's consent and approval.\n\nGiven that the LRCN - Series 2 and LRCN - Series 3 satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\n## R Reeddeemmppttiioonnss  ooff  PPrreeffeerrrreedd  SShhaarreess\n\nOn August 16, 2021, i.e., the first business day after the August 15, 2021 redemption date, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 36 First Preferred Shares.

Any repurchase through the Toronto Stock Exchange will be done at market price. The common shares may also be repurchased through other means authorized by the Toronto Stock Exchange and applicable regulations, including private agreements or share repurchase programs under issuer bid exemption orders issued by the securities regulators. A private purchase made under an exemption order issued by a securities regulator will be done at a discount to the prevailing market price. The amounts that are paid above the average book value of the common shares are charged to Retained earnings. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank repurchased 2,500,000 common shares for $245 million, which reduced Common share capital by $24 million and Retained earnings by $221 million.\n\n## R Reesseerrvveedd  CCoommmmoonn  SShhaarreess\n\nAs at October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 15,507,568 common shares reserved under the Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan.

In addition, the ability to pay common share dividends is restricted by the terms of the outstanding preferred shares pursuant to which the Bank may not pay dividends on its common shares without the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, unless all preferred share dividends have been declared and paid or set aside for payment.\n\n## D Diivviiddeenndd  RReeiinnvveessttmmeenntt  aanndd  SShhaarree  PPuurrcchhaassee  PPllaann\n\nThe Bank has a Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan for holders of its common and preferred shares under which they can acquire common shares of the Bank without paying commissions or administration fees. Participants acquire common shares through the reinvestment of cash dividends paid on the shares they hold or through optional cash payments of at least $1 per payment, up to a maximum of $5,000 per quarter. Common shares subscribed by participants are purchased on their behalf in the secondary market through the Bank's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, at a price equal to the average purchase price of the common shares during the three business days immediately following the dividend payment date.\n\n## N Noottee  1199  --  NNoonn--CCoonnttrroolllliinngg  IInntteerreessttss\n\n| As at October 31           | 2 2002222   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Flinks Technology Inc.

This process is a key tool in establishing the Bank's capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments.\n\n## C Caappiittaall  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nCapital ratios are obtained by dividing capital (as defined by OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline) by risk-weighted assets and are expressed as percentages. Risk-weighted assets are calculated in accordance with the rules established by OSFI for on- and off-balance-sheet risks. Credit, market, and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets calculation for regulatory purposes. The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders' equity less goodwill, intangible assets, and other CET1 capital deductions. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital consists of eligible non-cumulative preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes, and other AT1 capital adjustments. The sum of CET1 and AT1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of the eligible portion of subordinated debt and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nThe Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain the following minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 12.0%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 14.0%. All of these ratios include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% established by the BCBS and OSFI as well as a 1.0% surcharge applicable solely to Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and a 2.5% domestic stability buffer. The domestic stability buffer, which can vary from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement will not be subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but will have to provide a remediation plan to OSFI. On June 22, 2022, OSFI confirmed that the domestic stability buffer was being maintained at 2.5%. Banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II Standardized Approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 70% of the capital requirements as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to risk-weighted assets. Lastly, OSFI requires Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of onbalance-sheet assets (including derivative exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total exposure.\n\nSince November 1, 2021, OSFI has also been requiring D-SIBs to maintain a risk-based total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) ratio of at least 24.0% (including the domestic stability buffer) of risk-weighted assets and a TLAC leverage ratio of at least 6.75%. The purpose of TLAC is to ensure that a D-SIB has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization in the unlikely event it becomes non-viable.\n\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI's regulatory capital, leverage, and TLAC requirements.",

Under this plan, participants can defer a portion of their annual compensation, and the Bank may pay a contribution to key employees when certain financial objectives are met. Amounts awarded by the Bank and the compensation deferred by participants are invested in, among other items, Bank common share units. These share units represent a right that has a value equal to the closing price of the Bank's common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the award date. Additional units are credited to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to the dividends declared on the Bank's common shares. Share units representing the amounts awarded by the Bank vest evenly over four years.

The Bank also offers other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The defined benefit component of the pension plans provides benefits based on years of plan participation and average earnings at retirement. The other post-employment benefits include post-employment medical, dental, and life insurance coverage. Since September 19, 2022, the Bank has been offering a new defined contribution component that is available to all new employees upon hiring as well as to current participants of the defined benefit component. Therefore, as of that date, the defined benefit component is no longer offered to new employees. For the defined contribution component, the Bank's base contribution equals a percentage of annual salary and the Bank's additional contribution varies according to the employee's contributions, and the sum of the employee's age and years of continuous service. The defined benefit component of the pension plans is funded, whereas the defined contribution component and the other post-employment benefit plans are not funded. The fair value of the defined benefit component and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were measured as at October 31.\n\nThe Bank's most significant pension plan is the Employee Pension Plan of the National Bank of Canada; it is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency and subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the Income Tax Act.\n\nThe defined benefit component of the pension plans and the other post-employment benefit plans exposes the Bank to specific risks such as investment performance, changes to the discount rate used to calculate the obligation, the longevity of plan participants, and future inflation. While management believes that the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation process are reasonable, there remains a degree of risk and uncertainty that may cause future results to differ significantly from these assumptions, which could give rise to gains or losses.\n\nAccording to the Bank's governance rules, the policies and risk management related to the defined benefit component of the pension plans are overseen at different levels by the pension committees, the Bank's management, and the Board's Human Resources Committee. The defined benefit component of the pension plans are examined on an ongoing basis in order to monitor the funding and investment policies, the financial status of the plans, and the Bank's funding requirements.\n\nThe Bank's funding policy for the defined benefit component of the pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by pension regulators.\n\nFor funded plans, the Bank determines whether an economic benefit exists in the form of potential reductions in future contributions and in the form of refunds from the plan surplus, where permitted by applicable regulations and plan provisions.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  BBeenneeffiitt  OObblliiggaattiioonn,,  AAsssseettss  ooff  tthhee  PPllaannss,,  aanndd  FFuunnddeedd  SSttaattuuss\n\nAs at October

For each plan, an allocation range per asset class is defined using a mix of equity and debt securities to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets and minimize asset/liability mismatching.\n\nThe assets of the pension plans may include investment securities issued by the Bank. As at October 31, 2022 and 2021, the assets of the pension plans do not include any securities issued by the Bank.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, the Bank and its related entities received $21 million ($15 million in fiscal 2021) in fees from the pension plans for related management, administration and custodial services.",

Short-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data from corporate AA bonds. Long-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on actual data and extrapolated data.\n\nTo measure the obligation related to the defined benefit component of the pension plans and related to the other post-employment benefit plans, the vested benefits that the Bank expects to pay in each future period are discounted to the measurement date using the spot rate associated with each of the respective periods based on the yield curve derived using the above methodology. The sum of discounted benefit amounts represents the defined benefit obligation. An average discount rate that replicates this obligation is then computed.\n\nTo better reflect current service cost, a separate discount rate was determined to account for the timing of future benefit payments associated with the additional year of service to be earned by the plan's active participants. Since these benefits are, on average, being paid at a later date than the benefits already earned by participants as a whole (i.e., longer duration), this method results in the use of a generally higher discount rate for calculating current service cost than that used to measure obligations where the yield curve is positively sloped. The methodology used to determine this discount rate is the same as the one used to establish the discount rate for measuring the obligation.\n\n## Other Assumptions\n\nFor measurement purposes, the estimated annual growth rate for health care costs was 4.77% as at October 31, 2022 (4.52% as at October 31, 2021). Based on the assumption retained, this rate is expected to increase to 5.42% in 2025, then remain at 5.30% from 2026 to 2030, then decrease gradually to 4.05% in 2040 and remain steady thereafter.\n\nMortality assumptions are a determining factor when measuring the defined benefit obligation. Determining the expected benefit payout period is based on best estimate assumptions regarding mortality. Mortality tables are reviewed at least once a year, and the assumptions made are in accordance with accepted actuarial practice. New results regarding the plans are reviewed and used in calculating best estimates of future mortality.\n\n## As at October 31\n\n|                                                                  | Pension plans - Defined benefit component   | Pension plans - Defined benefit component   | Other post-employment benefit plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                  | 2 2002222                                   | 2021                                        | 2 2002222                             | 2021                                  |\n| D Deeffiinneedd  bbeenneeffiitt  oobblliiggaattiioonn            |                                             |                                             |                                       |                                       |\n| Discount rate                                                    | 5 5..4455   % %                             | 3.55  %                                     | 5 5..4455   % %                       | 3.55  %                               |\n| Rate of compensation increase                                    | 3 3..0000   % %                             | 3.00  %                                     | 3 3..0000   % %                       | 3.00  %                               |\n| Health care cost trend rate                                      |                                             |                                             | 4 4..7777   % %                       | 4.52  %                               |\n| Life expectancy (in years)  at 65 for a participant currently at |                                             |                                             |                                       |                                       |\n| Age 65                                                           |                                             |                                             |                                       |                                       |\n| Men                                                              | 2 222..44                                   | 21.4                                        | 2 222..44                             | 21.4                                  |\n| Women                                                            | 2 244..77                                   | 23.7                                        | 2 244..77                             | 23.7                                  |\n| Age 45                                                           |                                             |                                             |                                       |                                       |\n| Men                                                              | 2 233..44                                   | 22.4                                        | 2 233..44                             | 22.4                                  |\n| Women                                                            | 2 255..66                                   | 24.7                                        | 2 255..66                             | 24.7                                  |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

These impacts are hypothetical and should be interpreted with caution, as changes in each significant assumption may not be linear. The Bank has decided to adjust the table by varying the discount rate by 1.00% instead of the 0.25% used in the previous fiscal year to reflect the current economic environment.\n\nAs at October 31, 2022\n\n|                                                                 | Pension plans - Defined  benefit component   Change in the obligation   | Other post-employment  benefit plans   Change in the obligation   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact of a 1.00% increase in the discount rate                 | (401)                                                                   | (11)                                                              |\n| Impact of a 1.00% decrease in the discount rate                 | 513                                                                     | 13                                                                |\n| Impact of a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase | 23                                                                      |                                                                   |\n| Impact of a 0.25% decrease in the rate of compensation increase | (25)                                                                    |                                                                   |\n| Impact of a 1.00% increase in the health care cost trend rate   |                                                                         | 5                                                                 |\n| Impact of a 1.00% decrease in the health care cost trend rate   |                                                                         | (4)                                                               |\n| Impact of an increase in the age of participants by one year    | (82)                                                                    | (1)                                                               |\n| Impact of a decrease in the age of participants by one year     | 76                                                                      | 1                                                                 |\n\n## P Prroojjeecctteedd  BBeenneeffiitt  PPaayymmeennttss\n\nYear ended October 31\n\n|              | Pension plans - Defined  benefit component   |   Other post-employment  benefit plans |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 2023         | 235                                          |                                      9 |\n| 2024         | 244                                          |                                      8 |\n| 2025         | 254                                          |                                      8 |\n| 2026         | 264                                          |                                      8 |\n| 2027         | 272                                          |                                      7 |\n| 2028 to 2032 | 1,489                                        |                                     36 |",

The Bank remains confident that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously defend its position. As a result, no amount has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2022.\n\n## P Prrooppoosseedd  LLeeggiissllaattiioonn\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-32 - An Act to implement certain provisions of the fall economic statement table in Parliament on November 3, 2022 and certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on April 7, 2022 to implement tax measures applicable to certain entities of banking and life insurer groups, as presented in its budget of April 7, 2022. These tax measures include the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD), which is a one-time 15% tax on the fiscal 2021 and 2020 average taxable income above $1 billion, and also include a 1.5% increase in the statutory tax rate. The amount of CRD for the Bank is estimated at $32 million. Since these tax measures were not substantively enacted at the reporting date, no amount has been recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2022.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

These letters of guarantee represent irrevocable commitments that the Bank will make payments in the event that a client cannot meet its obligations to third parties. The Bank's policy for requiring collateral security with respect to letters of guarantee is similar to that for loans.

The Bank provides backstop liquidity facilities to these multi-seller conduits.

These facilities have terms of less than one year and are automatically renewable unless the Bank sends a non-renewal notice. As at October 31, 2022 and 2021, the committed notional value for these facilities was $30 million. To date, the credit enhancement facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn.\n\nThe maximum risk of loss for the Bank cannot exceed the total amount of commercial paper outstanding, i.e., $3.2 billion as at October 31, 2022 ($2.8 billion as at October 31, 2021).

Certain fixed-income clearing members of CDCC have provided an equally shared committed and uncommitted global overnight liquidity facility for the purpose of supporting CDCC in its clearing activities of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements or sold under repurchase agreements. The objective of this facility is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event of a clearing member's default. As a fixed-income clearing member providing support to CDCC, the Bank provides a liquidity facility. As at October 31, 2022, the notional amount of the overnight uncommitted liquidity facility amounted to $5.6 billion ($4.5 billion as at October 31, 2021). As at October 31, 2022 and 2021, no amount had been drawn.\n\n## S Seeccuurriittiieess  LLeennddiinngg\n\nUnder securities lending agreements that the Bank has entered into with certain clients who have entrusted it with the safekeeping of their securities, the Bank lends the securities to third parties and indemnifies its clients in the event of loss. To protect itself against any contingent loss, the Bank obtains, as security from the borrower, a cash amount or extremely liquid marketable securities with a fair value greater than that of the securities loaned. No amount has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to potential indemnities resulting from securities lending agreements.\n\n## O Otthheerr  IInnddeemmnniiffiiccaattiioonn  AAggrreeeemmeennttss\n\nIn the normal course of business, including securitization transactions and discontinuances of businesses and operations, the Bank enters into numerous contractual agreements under which it undertakes to compensate the counterparty for costs incurred as a result of litigation, changes in laws and regulations (including tax legislation), claims with respect to past performance, incorrect representations or the non-performance of certain restrictive covenants. The Bank also undertakes to indemnify any person acting as a director or officer or performing a similar function within the Bank or one of its subsidiaries or another entity, at the request of the Bank, for all expenses incurred by that person in proceedings or investigations to which he or she is party in that capacity. Moreover, as a member of a securities transfer network and pursuant to the membership agreement and the regulations governing the operation of the network, the Bank granted collateral in favour of the Bank of Canada to guarantee any obligation of the Bank towards the Bank of Canada that could result from the Bank's participation in the securities transfer network. The durations of the indemnification agreements vary according to circumstance; as at October 31, 2022 and 2021, given the nature of the agreements, the Bank is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential liability it could be required to pay to counterparties. No amount related to these agreements has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## C Coommmmiittmmeennttss\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  IInnssttrruummeennttss\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments.

The recent developments in the main legal proceeding involving the Bank are as follows:\n\n## Defrance\n\nOn January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the National Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Bank's consolidated results of operations for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank's consolidated financial position.",

        "page_content": "## N Noottee  2277  --  SSttrruuccttuurreedd  EEnnttiittiieess\n\nA structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting treatment described in Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements. The Bank's maximum exposure to loss resulting from its interests in these structured entities consists primarily of the investments in these entities, the fair value of derivative financial instrument contracts entered into with them, and the backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities granted to certain structured entities.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities, including commercial loans, reverse repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the counterparty credit risk of the structured entities, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither power nor significant variable returns resulting from financing transactions with structured entities and does not consolidate such entities. Financing transactions with third-party-sponsored structured entities are included in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and are not included in the table accompanying this note on page 219.\n\n## N Noonn--CCoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  SSttrruuccttuurreedd  EEnnttiittiieess\n\n## Multi-Seller Conduits\n\nThe Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the assets acquired. Clients use these multi-seller conduits to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The Bank acts as a financial agent and provides these conduits with administrative and transaction structuring services as well as backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Note 26. The Bank has concluded derivative financial instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the Bank has the ability to direct the relevant activities of these conduits, it cannot use its power to affect the amount of the returns it obtains, as it acts as an agent. Consequently, the Bank does not control these conduits and does not consolidate them.\n\n## Investment Funds\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. In addition, the Bank is sponsor and investment manager of mutual funds in which it has insignificant or no interest. The Bank does not control the funds where its holdings are not significant given that, in these circumstances, the Bank either acts only as an agent or does not have any power over the relevant activities. In both cases, it does not have significant exposure to the variable returns of the funds. Therefore, the Bank does not consolidate these funds.\n\n## Private Investments\n\nAs part of its investment banking operations, the Bank invests in several limited liability partnerships and other incorporated entities. These investment companies in turn invest in operating companies with a view to reselling these investments at a profit over the medium or long term. The Bank does not intervene in the operations of these entities; its only role is that of an investor. Consequently, it does not control these companies and does not consolidate them.\n\n## Third-Party Structured Entities\n\nThe Bank has invested in third-party structured entities, some of which are asset-backed. The underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans, leases, and securities. The Bank does not have the ability to direct the relevant activities of these structured entities and has no exposure to their variable returns, other than the right to receive interest income and dividend income from its investments. Consequently, the Bank does not control these structured entities and does not consolidate them.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The excess spread represents the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid. The Bank also provides second-loss protection as it holds subordinated notes issued by CCCT II. In addition, the Bank acts as an administrative agent and servicer and as such is responsible for the daily administration and management of CCCT II's credit card receivables. The Bank therefore has the ability to direct the relevant activities of CCCT II and can exercise its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls CCCT II and consolidates it.\n\n## Multi-Seller Conduit\n\nThe Bank administers a multi-seller conduit that purchases various financial assets from clients and finances those purchases by issuing debt securities (including commercial paper) backed by the assets acquired. The clients use this multi-seller conduit to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. The Bank holds the sole note issued by the conduit and has concluded a derivative financial instrument contract with the conduit. The Bank controls the relevant activities of this conduit through its involvement as a financial agent, agent for administrative and transaction structuring services as well as investor in the conduit's sole note. The Bank's functions and investment in the conduit confer to it decision-making power over the composition of assets acquired by the conduit and the selection of the seller as well as some exposure to the conduit's variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates this conduit.",

The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. The Bank controls the relevant activities of certain funds through its involvement as an investor and its significant exposure to their variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates these funds.\n\n## Covered Bonds\n\n## NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership\n\nIn December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. The Bank acts as manager of the partnership and has decision-making authority over its relevant activities in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program. In addition, the Bank is able, in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program, to affect the variable returns of the partnership, which are directly related to the return on the mortgage loan portfolio and the interest on the loans from the Bank. Consequently, the Bank controls the partnership and consolidates it.\n\n## Third-Party Structured Entities\n\nIn 2018, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, provided financing to a third-party structured entity in exchange for a 100% interest in a loan portfolio, the sole asset held by that entity. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the structured entity, as it has the ability to direct the entity's relevant activities through its involvement in the decision-making process. The Bank is also exposed to the entity's variable returns.\n\nThe following table presents the Bank's investments and other assets in the consolidated structured entities as well as the total assets of these entities.\n\n| As at October 31                                                      | 2002222                                                     | 2002222                         | 2021   Total                  | 2021   Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                       | I Innvveessttmmeennttss   a anndd  ootthheerr  aasssseettss | T Toottaall   a asssseettss (1) | Investments  and other assets | assets (1)     |\n| C Coonnssoolliiddaatteedd  ssttrruuccttuurreedd  eennttiittiieess     |                                                             |                                 |                               |                |\n| Securitization entity for the Bank ' s credit card receivables (2)(3) | 1 1,,991166                                                 | 2 2,,007733                     | 2,410                         | 2,544          |\n| Multiseller conduit (4)                                               | 8 80022                                                     | 8 80022                         | 256                           | 256            |\n| Investment funds (5)                                                  | 5 566                                                       | 5 566                           | 121                           | 121            |\n| Covered bonds (6)                                                     | 1 177,,990000                                               | 1 188,,223377                   | 15,663                        | 16,048         |\n| Third-party structured entities (7)                                   | 1 16666                                                     | 1 16666                         | 169                           | 169            |\n|                                                                       | 2 200,,884400                                               | 2 211,,333344                   | 18,619                        | 19,138         |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The information gathered from this maturity analysis is a component of liquidity and funding management. However, this maturity profile does not represent how the Bank manages its interest rate risk nor its liquidity risk and funding needs. The Bank considers factors other than contractual maturity when assessing liquid assets or determining expected future cash flows.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the funding needs of its clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn.\n\nThe Bank also has future minimum commitments under leases for premises as well as under other contracts, mainly commitments to purchase loans and contracts for outsourced information technology services. Most of the lease commitments are related to operating leases.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

For presentation purposes, other activities are grouped in the Other heading. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele, and marketing strategy. The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2021. This presentation reflects the fact that the loan portfolio of borrowers in the \" Oil and gas \" and \" Pipelines \" sectors as well as related activities, which had previously been reported in the Personal and Commercial segment, is now reported in the Financial Markets segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its activities with its management structure.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall  aanndd  CCoommmmeerrcciiaall\n\nThe Personal and Commercial segment encompasses the banking, financing, and investing services offered to individuals, advisors and businesses as well as insurance operations.\n\n## W Weeaalltthh  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe Wealth Management segment comprises investment solutions, trust services, banking services, lending services and other wealth management solutions offered through internal and third-party distribution networks.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  MMaarrkkeettss\n\nThe Financial Markets segment encompasses corporate banking and investment banking and financial solutions for large and mid-size corporations, public sector organizations, and institutional investors.\n\n## U U..SS..

Taxable equivalent basis is a calculation method that consists in grossing up certain tax-exempt income by the amount of income tax that would have otherwise been payable. The effect of these adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. Operations support charges are allocated to each operating segment presented in the business segment results. The Bank assesses performance based on the net income attributable to the Bank's shareholders and holders of other equity instruments. Intersegment revenues are recognized at the exchange amount.",

(Flinks), a leading fintech company specialized in financial data aggregation and distribution, in which the Bank had already been holding a 30.2% equity interest. Flinks provides services to a wide North American fintech ecosystem and offers attractive data technology solutions. The acquisition strategically positions the Bank in a high-growth market so that it can continue enhancing customer experiences and benefitting from future technology-driven innovations. At the time of acquisition, the amount of which was $73 million in cash for voting preferred shares, the Bank was holding an 82.9% equity interest in Flinks, thereby giving it control thereover. Immediately after the acquisition, the Bank made an additional $30 million investment in voting preferred shares, giving the Bank an 85.9% equity interest in Flinks. The amount of the $73 million purchase price, of the fair value of the previously held equity interest, and of the estimated value of the non-controlling interest established on the acquisition date, exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $101 million. This excess amount was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill and mainly represents the future profits expected from Flinks given its favourable position in this growth market. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The previously held equity interest, accounted for as an associate, was remeasured at fair value, generating a $33 million non-taxable remeasurement gain that was reported in the Non-interest income - Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2021. With respect to the presentation of financial results according to business segment, the gain on remeasurement of the previously held equity interest as well as the financial results of Flinks are being reported in the Other heading of segment results. The financial results of Flinks have been consolidated into the Bank's financial statements since September 8, 2021.\n\nDuring the measurement period ended September 8, 2022, the final measurement of Flinks's net assets and the final calculation of working capital adjustments had no significant impact on goodwill.\n\n## N Noottee  3322  --  EEvveenntt  AAfftteerr  tthhee  CCoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  BBaallaannccee  SShheeeett  DDaattee\n\n## R Reeppuurrcchhaassee  ooff  CCoommmmoonn  SShhaarreess\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid, beginning December 12, 2022, to repurchase for cancellation up to 7,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 2.08% of its outstanding common shares) over the 12-month period ending December 11, 2023.
