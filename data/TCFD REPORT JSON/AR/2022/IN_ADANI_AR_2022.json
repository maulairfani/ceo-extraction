By making disproportionate investments, it intends to shift the needle not just for its investee Company but for the country as a whole - with the objective of extending access, reducing costs, widening the market and, in doing so, helping strengthen India.\n\nCompetitive advantage : At the Adani portfolio of companies, we believe that the ability to make a significant national\n\ncontribution can only be derived from a broadbased competitive advantage that is not dependent on any one factor but is the result of an overarching culture of excellence - the coming together of adjacent businesses, deep sectorial experience, ability to commission projects faster than the sectorial curve, competence to do so at a cost lower than the industry average, foresight to not merely service the market but to grow it, establish decisive sustainable leadership and evolve the Company's position into a generic name within the sector.\n\n## Relatively non-mature spaces :\n\nThe Adani portfolio of companies has entered businesses that may be considered 'maturely nonmature'. Some of the businesses can be classified as mature, based on the enduring industry presence and the conventional interpretation of their market potential; these businesses can be considered non-mature by the virtue of their vast addressable market potential and the superior\n\nAdani portfolio of companies value proposition. The result is that the Adani portfolio of companies addresses sectorial spaces not on the basis of existing market demand but on the basis of prospective market growth following the superior Adani sectorial value proposition.\n\nOutsized : The Adani portfolio of companies established a respect for taking outsized bets in select sectors and businesses without compromising Balance Sheet safety. The portfolio of companies establishes a large capacity aspiration that sends out a strong message of its longterm direction. Its outsized initial capacity establishes economies of scale within a relatively short time horizon that deters prospective competition and generates cost leadership (fixed and variable).\n\nTechnology : The Adani portfolio of companies invests in the best technology standards that could generate precious additional basis points in profitability and",

The portfolio of companies has established benchmark credentials in executing projects\n\nfaster than the sectorial average by drawing from the multidecade Adani pool of managerial excellence across a range of competencies.

I learnt that the Collins dictionary had defined it as 'An extended period of instability and insecurity'. It also chose it as the Word for the Year 2022. Interestingly, I also learnt that two other words that were in the running for the top spot were 'quiet quitting', which meant doing the bare minimum duties at work (in rejection of competitive careerism) and 'vibe shift', which meant a significant change in the prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that in the post-Covid world, these words accurately summarise changes that we see happening around us.",

        "page_content": "## A Global Reset is Underway\n\nThere can be no denying that the world is continuing to be hit by multiple shocks, be it the climate emergency, geopolitical disequilibrium, supply chain and energy volatility, or persistent inflation. What does make the situation a permacrisis is the fact that we have never had a time wherein all these events happened simultaneously and\n\nwithout a clear solution in sight. Add to this the opportunities and challenges because of the technological revolution, especially the breathtaking advances in artificial intelligence, and what we have is a massive potential reset in the existing global operating models. The future of work, the future of learning, the future of\n\nmedicine, and in some ways, the future of economic growth itself will need to be reset. Therefore, as we end one financial cycle and begin another, it is important to step back and assess the global economic situation and India's position as a part of this landscape.\n\n## India - The Beacon of Hope\n\nWhile economic cycles are getting increasingly hard to forecast, there is little doubt that India, already the world's fifth largest economy, will become the world's third largest economy well before 2030 and, thereafter, the world's second largest economy by 2050.\n\nIt is well understood that for any economy to lay the foundation of growth, a stable Government is critical. We have seen this impact with the implementation of several structural reforms that are critical for strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. This stability, coupled with India's young demographics and continued expansion of internal demand, is a potent combination.\n\nOur nation's demographic dividend is expected to drive consumption and accelerate the growth of a tax paying society at a record pace over the next three decades. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) projects that India's median age will be just 38 years even in 2050. Over this period, India's population is expected to grow by approximately 15%\n\nto 1.6 Billion, but the per capita income could accelerate by over 700% to about US dollars 16,000. On a purchasing power parity basis, this per capita metric could be three to four times higher. The growth of this consuming middle-class is expected to insulate us to some extent from global recessions as our growth is primarily driven by domestic demand. This, in turn, should drive a surge in private and government expenditures, as well as attract increasing foreign direct investments.\n\nWe have the statistics to prove it. Following independence in 1947, it took us 58 years to get to our first trillion dollars in GDP, 12 years to get to the next trillion and just five years to the third trillion. I anticipate that within the next decade, India will start adding a trillion dollars to its GDP every 18 months, putting us on track to emerge as a 25 to 30 trillion dollar economy by 2050. This could potentially drive India's total market capitalisation to over USD 40 trillion, an approximate 10x expansion from the current levels.\n\nI urge you to reflect on these incredible possibilities. India's success story of balancing economic growth and a vibrant democratic society has no parallel and a result, my belief in the India growth story has never been higher.\n\nOur nation's demographic dividend is expected to drive consumption and accelerate the growth of a tax paying society at a record pace over the next three decades.",

On the eve of our Republic Day, a US-based shortseller published a report just as we were planning to launch the largest Follow-on Public Offering (FPO) in India's history. The report was a combination of targeted misinformation and outdated, discredited allegations aimed at damaging our reputation and generating profits through a deliberate drive-down of our stock prices.\n\nSubsequently, despite a fully subscribed FPO, we selected to withdraw and return the money to our investors to protect their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterests. The short-selling incident resulted in several adverse consequences that we had to confront. Even though we promptly issued a comprehensive rebuttal, various vested interests tried to opportunistically exploit the claims made by the short seller. These entities engaged and encouraged false narratives across various news and social media platforms. Consequently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India constituted an Expert Committee to look into this matter. It comprised individuals known for their independence and integrity. The report of the Expert Committee was made public in May 2023.\n\nThe Expert Committee did not find any regulatory failure. The Committee's Report not only observed that the mitigating measures, undertaken by your company helped rebuild confidence but also cited that there were credible charges of concerted destabilisation of the Indian markets. It also confirmed the quality of our Group's disclosures and found no instance of regulatory failure or any breach. While the SEBI is still to submit its report in the months ahead, we remain confident of our governance and disclosure standards.\n\n## Adani Group Resilient, Stronger and Record Results for FY 2022-23\n\nOver the past three decades, I have learnt that growth comes with its set of challenges. Every challenge we have faced has made us more resilient. This resilience is vindicated by the outcomes we deliver.\n\nOur FY 2022-23 operational and financial results are as much a testimony to our success as a testimony to the continued expansion of our customer base - be it on the B2B side or the B2C side. Our Balance Sheet, our assets, and our operating\n\ncashflows continue to get stronger and are now healthier than ever before. The pace at which we have made acquisitions and turned them around is unmatched across the national landscape and has fuelled a significant part of our expansion. Our national and international partnerships are proof of our governance standards. The scale of our international expansions has been validated by our successes in Australia, Israel, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.",

During FY 2022-23, much of the world was affected by a continuing conflict in Europe, and a consequent increase in energy costs, which created a spiral of rising inflation, rate hikes by central banks, and stress on the banking system, which translated into an economic slowdown and early signs of an impending recession.\n\n## Emerging trend\n\nOver the coming decade, India's energy demand is projected to grow more than 40%, while peak demand is expected to grow by nearly 70%. This increase in demand for electricity will be catalysed by a much larger economy comprising a growing population with rising incomes and fast-improving living standards, greater share of the industrial sector - especially high-value manufacturing, and an accelerating shift in the choice of transport mode towards electric vehicles, abetting quality-of-life imperatives.

This\n\ndemand growth is a direct result of the commendable GDP growth, a concrete evidence of strong economic fundamentals, neversay-die attitude of the people, and foresight of government policies in times of global uncertainty.\n\n## Sectoral outlook\n\nInvestments in renewable energy in India have started outstripping those in conventional power over the last few years owing to the Government's emphasis on increasing the penetration of non-fossil fuel sources in the power generation mix. However, coal-based power is expected to continue playing an important role, given the ready availability of fuel and its propensity to support the grid at times of low renewable energy generation.\n\nIt is observed that power distribution companies have been increasingly preferring long-term power purchase agreements\n\n## Fuel availability\n\nA power producer like your Company has to ensure the timely availability of fuel at all plants, so that emerging demand can be met without disruptions, and contractual obligations can be addressed. Fuel management and logistics are complex activities requiring the handson management of multiple touchpoints with a myriad of\n\nagencies.

We have been able to negotiate mediumterm coal linkages under SHAKTI policy for supplying power under medium- term PPAs.\n\n## Performance for FY 2022-23\n\nDuring the year under review, APL's operating performance was constrained by high import coal prices in the case of coastal plants and domestic coal related\n\nconstraints at plants with open capacities.

This creates an opportunity for growthdriven companies to judiciously blend renewable energy with conventional generation, reconciling the need for sustainable energy with reliability and scalability.\n\nAt the same time, the reemergence of peak deficits and energy deficits due to strong demand growth is driving volumes and rates in the short-term market, creating opportunities for gainful placement of untied conventional power capacities.\n\nThe Company was able to achieve a quick turnaround of MEL, which was a financially distressed asset before acquisition, by leveraging APL's considerable skills and operational excellence.",

In doing so, we have positioned our assets as capable, dependable and responsible.\n\nThe Company invested in scale, scope and synergies, creating the next generation of national assets, strengthening the Company's performance, emerging as a sectorial benchmark and enhancing national respect.\n\nAdani Power resolved to graduate India to the next technology\n\n## Adani Power's supercritical and ultra-supercritical capacities: Transforming India\n\nEfficiency : Supercritical and ultra- supercritical power plants (operate at temperatures and pressures above the temperature and pressure at which the liquid and gas phases of water coexist in equilibrium) have an efficiency of more than 45%, 1300 bps higher than conventional power plants\n\nlevel in a conventional space. The company introduced India's first supercritical power generation unit (660 MW), when it commissioned Unit 5 in Mundra in December 2010. This power generation showpiece represented a convergence of scale (the world's largest singlelocation thermal power plant at that time) and efficiency, moderating the cost of power generation to one of the lowest in the country for modern power generation units.\n\nThe success of this plant inspired a technology revolution in India's power generation sector. In the next 13 years, the Company commissioned a significant portion of supercritical units in India.\n\nThe sizable critical mass of nextgeneration power generation assets has shifted the technology needle in India towards the cutting-edge and modern.\n\nCost-effective : The steam bottoming cycle is state-ofthe-art and requiring minimum development. The super-critical plants provide a superior costvalue proposition.\n\nProductivity : The load variation in supercritical boilers can be faster due to the absence of the drum. Higher temperature and pressure enhance efficiency, i.e. more electricity per ton of fired coal and correspondingly lower fuel used with moderated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAdani Power invested in India's largest seawater-based flue gas desulphurisation plant at its Mundra power generation facility. The company's Unit 4 (330MW sub-critical technology in the Mundra power plant) operated without downtime for a record 686 days; its Unit 7 (660MW supercritical technology at the Mundra power plant) delivered 444 days of uptime until 13 th September, 2020, record in India. Its Mundra power station was the world's first coal-based thermal power station to be registered with UNFCCC under CDM.\n\nThe Adani Power complement of more than a dozen modern power generation plants has enhanced respect for India's commitment to fight climate change with a complement of correspondingly complex technologies.\n\nCleaner : They require less coal per megawatt-hour with lower emissions (including carbon dioxide and mercury), higher efficiency and lower fuel costs per megawatt.\n\nFootprint : They provide a 10-15% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to a subcritical technology.",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nAt Adani Power, we introduced a completely new dimension in building large conventional power plants in India.\n\nBefore Adani Power had commissioned its first power plant, there was a conventional belief that such plants normally consumed the better part of a decade from concept to commissioning. During this period, such a project would be exposed to periodic cost escalations based on commodity price increases or changes in currency or interest rates. The result is that most conventional power plants in India reported cost mismatches between budgeted and eventual outcomes.\n\nAdani Power introduced a game-changing proposition: it commissioned the world's largest generation of thermal generation units around the shortest tenures (ground breaking to revenue accretion) in the country. In doing so, the company - new to power generation - graduated to a national benchmark.\n\nAdani Power emerged as a national benchmark in other ways as well.\n\nPioneering : The Company's Udupi plant was the first independent power project in India to utilise 100% imported coal. The Company's ultra-supercritical power project of 1,600 MW (2 x 800 MW) is supplying power to Bangladesh through a dedicated transmission line (secured by a 25-year power purchase agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board).\n\nThe Company invested in sonic soot blowers in its boilers to reduce ash accumulation in the gooseneck furnace areas. It installed fast cooling turbine devices to reduce turbine downtime in plants. Its thermography of coal stockpiles identifies hot spots in coal stockpiles to prevent coal fires in yards across all plants and eliminate energy loss. A comparative study between UAV Ninja/Drone and 3D scanner was carried out at Mundra port for volumetric measurement to establish technology suitability.\n\nSophistication : The company's 1,600 MW Godda thermal power project invested in the next generation ultra-supercritical technology. The Company's Energy Network Operations Centre (ENOC) utilised realtime data flows and artificial intelligence to course-correct and enhance performance. The use of drones enhanced inspection effectiveness across natural draft cooling tower and chimneys.\n\nSpeed : The Mundra super critical units 6 and 9 achieved synchronisation following boiler commissioning in less than 3.5 months, quicker than the national standard. The super critical segment of Unit 5 of the Mundra thermal power plant (660MW) was synchronised within 36 months, the fastest such implementation anywhere in the world. Two super-critical units (Unit 8 and Unit 9 of the Mundra thermal power plant) completed steam blowing within two days of boiler commissioning, among the quickest standards. The Mundra Units 3, 5 and 9 achieved\n\nfull load operation following synchronisation in less than four days.\n\nScale : The Mundra thermal power plant is India's largest to function off a seawater-based closed-cycle induced draft circulating cooling water system. The system draws on sea water that is recycled up to four times, conserving water and requiring a smaller discharge pipeline into the sea than an open circuit cooling system. The Company's Tiroda plant is equipped with the largest denomination of the latest high efficiency electrostatic precipitators (pollution control equipment) in Asia.\n\nIntegration : The Company invested in power generation facilities that represent a synergistic complement of scale, cost economy, feedstock integration, port support and power back-up. Besides, a complement of identical power generation units across locations helped optimise investment in spares and vendors. A phased indigenisation of critical equipment and broadbased domestic vendor eco-system enhanced supply chain security and national reliance.\n\nScope : The Company built the rail under rail on the congested Mumbai-Howrah rail link, removing bottlenecks in coal supply logistics.",

It is critical for industrial growth as well as for ensuring social growth of citizens and a high human development index.\n\nDemand for electricity in India is expected to grow at a sustained pace given the Indian government's push towards the Make In India programme, increasing industrialisation, improving incomes, enhanced living standards, and increasing penetration of electric vehicles in the transportation sector.\n\nThe 20 th Electric Power Survey of India, published in November 2022 by the Ministry of Power, projects total electric energy consumption at 1,610 BU in 2026-27 and 2,133 BU in 2031-32. The corresponding peak demand is projected at 277 GW and 366 GW for the two years respectively (total electricity demand in 202223 was 1,511 BU and peak demand was 216 GW).\n\nOver the longer term, power demand is projected to reach 3,423 BU by 2041-42 while peak demand is projected at 575 GW. The Central Electricity Authority\n\n(CEA) projects that India's projected installed capacity by the end of FY30 would be around 817 GW, up by around 450 GW over the present installed capacity.\n\nThe Government of India set a target of achieving 50% of the total installed capacity by the year 2030 from non-fossil fuels. The Optimal Generation Mix report published by CEA in April 2022 projects installed capacity of 777 GW by 2030. In comparison, installed capacity as of 31 st March, 2023 is 416 GW, of which 237 GW (57%) is from thermal power sources. Of this, coal and lignite-based power plants contribute 212 GW.\n\nThe report estimates that by 2029-30, installed capacity of coal and lignite-based power plants (net of retirements) would reach 252 GW. The likely share of thermal installed capacity is projected to reduce to 32% of the total installed capacity in 202930 as compared to 57% as of March 2023. However, in terms of energy generation, thermal power will continue to contribute the largest share at 57%, compared to more than 70% at present.\n\nThe reason for thermal power contributing a high share of\n\npower generation in the total energy mix is its inherent advantage of high levels of capacity utilisation, stemming from ready fuel availability from domestic sources. In contrast, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power suffer from intermittency and lower capacity utilisation. This makes thermal power ideal to supply base load power and support renewable power generation at times when solar and wind power generation is low.\n\nIn view of the realities, coal-based power will continue to play a significant role in addressing India's electricity demand across the long-term.\n\nAPL's current and upcoming capacities will increasingly play the twin roles of supplying base load power and enabling higher renewable energy penetration by serving peak power needs that cannot be addressed by intermittent power sources.",

EPMPL's name was changed to Mahan Energen Limited (MEL) following the acquisition.\n\nMEL owns and operates a 1,200 MW (2x600 MW) thermal power plant (Phase-I project) in the villages of Bandhaura, Khairahi, Karsualal and Nagwa in Tehsil Mada, Singrauli district, Madhya Pradesh. The power station comprises two units of 600 MW each.\n\nThe plant is proximate to prominent coal-bearing regions, a competitive advantage in terms of logistics costs.\n\n## Business process transformation\n\nFollowing acquisition, we integrated MEL into our systems and processes with speed. This helped scale PLF substantially in the first year of acquisition, which is a testimony to our rich knowledge, coupled with a\n\nculture of operational excellence, achieved through the DISHA process. DISHA is a proven Adani Business Operational Excellence model, designed to achieve operational transformation. DISHA was implemented in Mahan with in-house manpower. In addition to this, we inculcated Adani Safety Culture through implementation of Project Chetna, a model developed in association with renowned safety consultants for safety culture Transformation.\n\nYour Company invested in building the organisation and in infrastructure development, which yields in-process efficiency and productivity improvement. For example, in one of the two units, capital overhauling was carried out for more reliable and efficient power generation and an improved PLF.\n\nWe identified employee capabilities in various fields and offered targeted training programs to build the knowledge base and foster a culture of innovation and agility. We empowered employees to adapt quickly to changing technologies through digitalisation, and to generate maximum value out of the assets through the\n\nimplementation of the Asset Performance Management program.\n\n## Operational transformation\n\nImmediately after acquisition, we leveraged our considerable skills in fuel management and logistics to gain reliable access to fuel at a reasonable cost and improve competitiveness. Your Company's deep experience in power sales was leveraged to enable MEL to employ its generation capacity gainfully.\n\nMEL entered into a 23-month PPA to supply 200 MW of power starting September 2022. It secured 1.15 MMT of fuel under Shakti B (iii) Round-3 auctions, which is being used to supply power under the 200 MW medium term PPA.\n\nThrough these efforts, MEL was able to sell 2.41 Billion units of power in FY 2022-23 despite initial technical challenges, capital overhaul and a shortage of domestic coal experienced by the power sector.",

MEL is in possession of adequate land at the Bandhaura site to carry out an expansion by setting up facilities for the combined capacity of 2,800 MW.\n\n## Environmental protection\n\nMEL is in the process of development of a capital expenditure plan to install flue gas desulphurisers (FGD) to meet the prevalent emission norms notified by the MOEF&CC. The expansion project will also incorporate necessary emission control equipment to address emission norms.\n\n## Rationale for the Phase-II expansion project\n\nThe expansion project represents a sound investment for several reasons:\n\n- \u0083 The project will supply power to Madhya Pradesh, a populous state with a fast-growing economy, and support its economic growth.\n- \u0083 Major requirements for the expanded capacity, such as water linkage, land acquisition with a developed site, etc. are already in place, reducing the execution risk.\n- \u0083 A major part of the net capacity of the expansion project was tied up under a long-term PSA with the state government entity, thus mitigating market risk.\n- \u0083 Under the PSA, coal is arranged by the offtaker (MPPMCL) under SHAKTI B(iv) provisions. Alternate coal usage in case of shortfall will get a pass through under the terms of the PSA, thus addressing fuel price risk.\n- \u0083 The project is located in the vicinity of major coal bearing areas, marked by the development of commercial coal mines under the liberalised Coal Mining Policy. The project will minimise logistics of alternative fuel supplies by sourcing coal from proximate mines.\n\n## Building a Better Tomorrow\n\nIn this way, not only has your Company achieved a rapid turnaround of a previously financially stressed and operationally under-utilised power generation asset, but also improved its value to the economy by making it an important component of Madhya Pradesh's long-term power selfsuffiency.",

It is building a self-sustainable ecosystem to leverage both human potential and community resources for socio-economic growth. The initiatives are designed for onfarm, off-farm, and non-farm domains with objectives to increase, diversify, and sustain incomes. Through SLD, the Foundation offers a banquet of initiatives like water conservation, organic farming, dairy development through strategic animal husbandry projects, and augmentation of women's enterprises by supporting them with knowledge, skills, and market linkages. Details of initiatives in this theme is as follows:\n\nPASHUDHAN - Integrated livestock development centre (Kawai) : Livestock continues to be an important source of livelihood for small and marginal farmers in rural areas. With the growing demand of milk and dairy products, animal husbandry becomes the primary sector for developing small and marginal farmers with a major focus\n\non the improvement of cattle breeds (more female calves) for milk production.\n\nConsidering the scope to strengthen this sector, two Integrated Livestock Development Centre (ILDCs) are running successfully by the Adani Foundation at Nimoda and Bamori villages to provide breed improvement and cattle management services.\n\nThe main objective of livestock development activities is to upgrade the local indigenous low milk-yielding cows and buffaloes by breeding them through Artificial Insemination with the use of high-pedigree frozen semen of indigenous/exotic breeds. The process results in the birth of upgraded progeny with an improved genetic ensuring better milk-yielding capacity.\n\nThe Foundation has deployed 'Pashu-Mitra', an educated and local rural youth, after training him to facilitate animal breeding and ensure delivery of health and nutrition-related services like veterinary first aid, castration of scrub bulls, deworming, preventive vaccination against\n\nvarious diseases, infertility treatment etc.\n\nThese ILDCs are providing the following services:\n\nArtificial insemination (AI) : ILDCs are undertaking AI. The genetically superior progeny born out of this program will be better milk yielders. AI service is providing at the doorstep of the farmers with the use of highquality frozen semen. A total of 910 AIs were done during the year. ILDC in charge visits the cattle owner after 3 months of AI and does the cattle pregnancy test. After confirmation of pregnancy, Pashu Mitra guides the cattle owner on the required supplementary nutrition for the animal.\n\nVaccination : Over 1000 animals were given the required vaccination to safeguard them from common diseases (H.S.and B.Q).\n\nDeworming : Deworming medicines are given regularly to the newborn crossbred calves along with their mother. Dairy farmers are encouraged to treat their present non-descript cattle also with deworming medicines.\n\nFodder development : The significance of nutritious fodder lies in the fact that it can enhance the milk production capability of the farmer's livestock, thereby enabling an enhancement in his income levels. The eating capacity of enhanced animals also increases. Hence, good quality fodder needs to be supplemented. The Foundation supports farmers with the technical know-how of scientifically proven methods through fodder demonstration; 480 fodder demonstrations were done.\n\nCattle feed supplement : The Foundation is supporting farmers",

        "page_content": "with cattle feed supplements like calcium and mineral mixture for pregnant and dairy cattle. This is benefiting in more milk production and growth of calves. Total 450 cattle owners received supplementary feed.\n\n45 families were supported to adopt biogas, vermi compost and azolla cultivation.\n\n## Krishi-Kaushal - Fruit plantation for development of Wadi\n\n(Kawai) :This is one of the flagship projects of Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. The Wadi Project an integrated tribal development project is getting implemented in Kawai, Baran district. The main objective of this comprehensive project is to create opportunities for gainful self-employment for tribal families. The major challenges that tribal families face in the region are low land holding, soil degradation, high agriculture input costs, problems of pests and diseases, limited credit availability and unfavourable market situations. All these factors put together made the farming here less profitable. Wadi in local language means 'small orchard'.\n\nTwo or more fruit crops are selected towards minimising climate-related, biological, and marketing risks. Small farmers having less than 5-acre land are given 0.5-acre wadi each for raising 60 fruit plants suitable to local conditions. Further assistance towards enhancing the livelihood of farmers provided vegetable seeds to 20 farmers. These concerted efforts have resulted in an increase in income of approximately H 12000 to H 15000 for each family. In addition to this, farmers' families are having doorstep access to fresh and healthy organic vegetables.\n\nIn these 22 villages where the project is implemented, over 50 families are covered for developing 'wadis' of mango, orange, ber and guava plants. Fruiting has started in guava, ber and mango.\n\nThe Wadi Project is also adding another dimension of benefit that is institution building. It is carried out in the form of facilitation in promotion of local women groups, promoting income generation activities, and reducing drudgery. It is creating awareness on dairybased livelihoods, reproductive health, and other developmental aspects. The income generating activities included livestock management, develop wadis, vegetable cultivation, vermicomposting etc.\n\nAs a process, the project starts implementation through the formation of a village-level group with 25 women in each village. Total of 14 village and 350 women members are part of these groups. To further strengthen the process, the formation of a Farmers Producers Organisation (FPO) was facilitated. An FPO named Hadoti Pragatisheel Producer Company Limited was formed. This FPO has 305 women shareholders and runs a dairy development program. The FPO is collecting more than 400 liters of milk from 5 villages. The Foundation is facilitating capacity building through regular village-level meetings to orient farmers and cattle owners about agriculture and animal rearing best practices. It also provides exposure to dairy development and its marketing.\n\n## Skill development of youth\n\n(Singraulli) : Under Employment Development Programme, the Adani Foundation in collaboration with Union Bank's RSETI (Rural self-employment and Training\n\nInstitute) trained 52 youths in motor repairing, and selfemployed tailor (SET). Another 71 candidates received training in jute bag making, mushroom production, dhoop batti and artificial jewelry making.\n\n## Sports activity for youth\n\n(Singraulli) : Football, cricket, volleyball, kabaddi tournament, and athletic tournaments were organised for overall development of youths and towards maintaining positive relationship with community.\n\n## Animal husbandryrelated initiatives\n\nIn Tiroda, dairy business has favorable geographical condition, and many farmers are engaged in dairy business. But they are lacking in professional approach and technical enhancements to gain good profit margin. Hence, they are not able to sustain the income. Considering these challenges, the Adani Foundation has started livestock development center program in 26 villages in Tiroda block with the support of BAIF Institute of Sustainable Livelihood Development (BISLD). In this financial year, methods like Sorted Sex Semen (SSS) for Artificial Insemination (AI) was used to increase the occurrences of the birth of female calves. It ensures more than 90% possibility of female calves, which means more milking cattle and hence more income for the dairy farmers. Also, regular vaccination, health checkup camps, deworming drive, and fodder cultivation workshops are benefitting dairy farmers. Awareness is also created on the latest scientific animal management practices.",

This caused nodules on the cattle's skin and other parts of the body. Towards saving the lives of livestock of the farmers, with the support of district animal husbandry department, the Foundation facilitated vaccination of 6910 animals in 22 villages. 1989 cattle were checked in health camps and services like deworming, ticks, parasites demolition, infertility checkups, weakness treatments, and general treatments were provided. Some 481 cattle owners benefitted from these health check camps conducted in 10 villages.\n\nSo far, 475 vermi-compost beds were installed, attributing to crop yield and productivity increase by 15 %.\n\nSurplus compost is sold to needy farmers | Income from vermi compost added H 5000 in the annual incomes.\n\n8721 cattle were treated in these camps, helping 1510 families.\n\n351 cattle were vaccinated for protection from Lumpy disease.\n\nFodder demonstration and cultivation support : LDCs are promoting scientific fodder cultivation practices to develop healthy fodder feed management practices of livestock. 440 framers cultivated Hybrid Napier Fodder and 15 farmers cultivated Azolla Fodder. The availability of good quality of adequate fodder round the year improves milk productivity as well as animal health. 50 farmers trained to cultivate maise in one acre each and prepare silage to use and supply to cattle owners. This will help in the availability of green fodder for cattle owners and additional income to these farmers.\n\n## Agriculture initiatives\n\nDrip irrigation programme : This programme supports widow women farmers in the droughtprone Amravati region who lost their husbands as they committed suicide because of losses incurred in farming. The Foundation is supporting such women who are affected by severe crop damage of orange and cotton because of drought and lack of irrigation facilities. Under this program, drip irrigation facilities are installed on the farms. In FY-2022-23, 43 women of the Amravati region were supported - 171 women farmers benefitted. They are now able to safeguard their crops and maximise their harvests of cotton and oranges.\n\n## System Rice Intensification (SRI) through organic ways :\n\nThe organic SRI is a cultivation technique proven to yield more with less investment. It is based on scientific principles of paddy cultivation, mainly focused on water management, youngaged seeding, careful single seedling transplantation, and rotary weeding for soil aeration. 50 farmers were trained and\n\nencouraged to cultivate their farms using this technique. These farmers were also encouraged to produce and use organic fertiliser and pesticide to use in paddy fields.\n\nSRI is effective in increasing rice yields while reducing input costs. There was an average increase in yield by 21.30% and average net profit H 11,189/- per farmer.\n\n## Capacity building and support for income generation activity\n\n## Agarbatti production : 20\n\nAgarbatti machines were provided in 6 villages (Garada, Ramatola, Tikaramtola, Mendipur, Gumadhawada, and Koddebarra) in Gondia. A total of 60 SHG women are involved in the Agarbatti production business. The Foundation also supports in market linkages. In this FY2022-23, 68,572 Kg Agarbatti was produced and sold for H 39.48 Lakhs.\n\nLac bangles making : Lac is cultivated on a large scale by farmers in Gondia District. Seeing the potential in bangles making, the Foundation initiated lac bangle making activity with women's SHG. Last year 45 women received advanced training. They achieved a turnover of H 57,310 and earned H 30004000 per member.\n\nMushroom cultivation : The initiative is gaining momentum and expanding. The Foundation has facilitated training to women in Tiroda block on the various techniques with a practical demonstration of oyster mushroom cultivation. As a result, in the reporting year, mushrooms were cultivated on 5342 beds with a total harvest of 13,355 kg that fetched a net profit of H 17.42 Lakhs",

Farmers were recommended routine deworming\n\nand vaccination with the feeding of supplementary mineral-vitamin mixture to improve cattle's overall health.\n\n## Vermi compost production,\n\nGodda : The aim of the program is to enable farmers to become Vermi-entrepreneurs to boost their income. During the year, 2022-23, 17 farmers were trained and supported with 22 Vermi compost beds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Community infrastructure development\n\nThe Adani Foundation is building and strengthening public infrastructures. It is dedicated to assessing community needs and aspirations for designing and providing suitable infrastructure solutions. The approach is to supplement the government's efforts in schools, primary health care centres, large water conservation structures, public ponds, roads etc.\n\nThe organisation has been instrumental in constructing water conservation structures in water-scarce regions of the\n\ncountry. It is also facilitating rooftop rainwater structures in rural households with the objective to reduce the drudgery of women who are mostly responsible to fetch water for the house. Similarly, hundreds of borewells have been dug and ponds have been deepened to ensure water availability round the year, for domestic use, animals and agriculture.\n\n## Kawai\n\nConstruction of CC Road in Salpura village: CC road has been\n\nExposure visit, Raipur : 100 farmers including SHG women gained knowledge of modern farming techniques through exposure visits at KVK, Raipur. Exposure to the SRI technique and Wadi development have created awareness of ways to gain more cultivation and income from their limited farmland.\n\nconstructed in Salpura village. The community shall own the responsibility of taking care of the road. 770 people will be benefitted.\n\n## Need-based infrastructure development in school :\n\nConstructed boundary wall, a stage and facilitated ground leveling work at Government Senior Secondary School, Dhara. 278 students of this school will benefit from these interventions. Innovative theme-based painting work is also done to provide a good learning ambience for students.\n\nWater conservation : This year, the Foundation deepened a pond (12,078 CUM water holding capacity) in Ghoti village that comes under the Zilla Parishad of Gondia. The project aims to ensure sufficient water supply for irrigating approximately 100 acres of agricultural land, benefitting 54 farmers. It will provide ample drinking water for village cattle and nearby wildlife during the dry summer months. The project also aims to improve the groundwater table and protect natural water bodies.\n\nDrinking water facilities : Installed 4 handpumps in 4 villages (Ekodi - Ramatola, Bhivapur, Belati Kd,",

The Foundation installed 130 seating benches across 20 villages for public convenience.\n\nVillage road, Udupi : UPCL is committed to execute infrastructure development works in the villages coming under the panchayats of Yellur, Mudarangadi, Tenka, Bada, Belapu, Palimar and Padubidri.\n\nAdani Skill Development Centre (ASDC) : It aims to play a significant role in improving the socio-economic status of marginalised youth and women\n\nby offering skill development training programmes that enhance their employability and enable them to become selfsufficient. These initiatives are designed to uplift individuals from the lower strata of society and empower them to secure sustainable livelihoods. The highlights from ASDC Centres:\n\nGodda : This centre currently offers training courses in seven different trades: welder, fitter, mason and bar bender, general duty assistant, hospitality, electrical, and digital literacy. These courses are actively running, providing valuable skills to participants. In the current year, a total of 716 young candidates have been trained, adding to the cumulative count of 4,600 candidates trained over the past five years. Notably, out of these 716 candidates, 122 youths secured job offers from reputed organisations. These job offers came with an attractive average annual package of H 1.74 Lakh, along with benefits such as accommodation and other facilities.\n\nTiroda : At this centre, a total of 245 candidates received training in various trades, including welder, fitter, assistant\n\nelectrician, domestic data entry operator, digital literacy, and beauty therapist.

        "page_content": "## Management discussion and analysis\n\n## Global economy overview\n\nFiscal  policy  measures  taken  by  Central  Banks  to combat the downturn caused by COVID-19 lockdowns during 2020 had the downside of sparking spiraling inflation globally, which got exacerbated due to energy price shocks triggered by the conflagration in Europe in early 2022. The strong monetary policy response adopted  by  Central  Banks  as  a  countermeasure, in  the  form  of  successive  interest  rate  increases and absorbing liquidity, in turn led to tightening of financial conditions. Ultimately, the combined impact of  all  these  measures  was  a  slowdown  in  global growth from 6.2% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022, according to the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Emerging economies  were  also  not  immune  from  economic contagion, having to face currency depreciation and capital flight as investors expectedly turned to riskoff positions, causing portfolio outflows.\n\nHowever, concerns of global recession were alleviated after  resilience  in  labour  markets  and  consumer spending were noted across advanced and emerging economies, reviving investor sentiment in the second half of FY 2022-23. Measures taken by Governments to mitigate the impact of high energy prices have borne fruit to some extent, helped by a milder winter in Europe, which helped avert a crisis in millions of homes that need heating during periods of extreme cold.  Global inflation seems to have peaked, while labour  markets  have  remained  resilient,  thereby creating  policy  room  for  governments  to  stave recession off.  Despite the arrival of good news, high inflation and a slowdown in global trade in face of continuing hostilities in Europe remain major worries for governments and policy makers.\n\n## Indian economy overview\n\nThe Indian economy has once again demonstrated its deeply rooted growth fundamentals and resilience in face of a global slowdown, by posting a Real GDP growth of 7.2% in FY 2022-23, according to provisional estimates  of  the  National  Statistical  Office  (NSO), following  a  solid  growth  of  9.1%  in  FY  2021-22  in\n\nthe post-pandemic period.  This strong growth is a testament to the depth of India's economy, resilience and productivity of its people, entrepreneurial spirit of its businessmen, and last but not the least, prudent polices and bold decision-making of its government.\n\nThe growth in national output is a result of a recovery in  discretionary  spending  indicating  restoration  of consumer confidence and the government's thrust on CAPEX and infrastructure build-out, which powered economic growth despite the impact of inflation and a slowdown in exports in view of the global economic situation.\n\nOn the positive side, inflation has moderated following successive increases in policy rates by the Reserve Bank, prudent measures taken by the government for  supply-side  management,  initiatives  like  Digital Transformation,  augmentation  of  capital  in  the banking  system  and  successful  efforts  to  improve asset quality, in addition to easing of strain on global supply  chains,  and  softening  of  global  commodity prices.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe  IMF's  World  Economic  Outlook  expects  a slowdown in global growth to 2.8% in 2023, with only marginal improvement to 3% over the medium term. Global  efforts  to  contain  and  reduce  inflation  may have  limited  success  in  view  of  stickiness  of  core inflationary  pressures.  The  heightened  uncertainty caused by the current geopolitical situation and aftereffects  of  the  pandemic  will  create  a  challenging trade-off  for  policymakers  between  restoring  price stability  and  addressing  growth  slowdown.  Further, the global banking system has recently shown signs of fragility with high-profile failures, while elevated levels of debt for many governments create a more structural risk that can threaten the global financial system if not contained prudentially and in a timely manner.\n\nThe insipid global conditions also pose a challenge for  India,  given  strong  global  linkages  especially concerning  fuel  imports  and  exports  of  finished products.  However,  the  repetitively  demonstrated\n\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\n\nSTATUTORY REPORTS",

The  Reserve  Bank projects real GDP growth for FY 2023-24 at 6.5%, taking into account softer global commodity prices, the government's continued thrust on CAPEX, higher capacity utilisation in manufacturing, robust credit growth,  containment  of  high  inflation  and  rising optimism among businesses and consumers.\n\n## Indian power sector review\n\nEconomic development of a nation cannot progress significantly without a strong and self-reliant power sector.  Universal  access  to  affordable  power  in  a sustainable manner has been the guiding principle for  the  Indian  power  sector.  The  Government  has taken  various  initiatives  to  transform  India  from  a power deficit to power surplus nation which includes increasing  overall  capacity,  connecting  the  whole nation into one grid, strengthening the distribution system and achieving universal household electrification.\n\nOn  the  generation  side,  Government  policies  have borne fruit and India is today the third largest producer of electricity in the world, with installed generation capacity of over 4,16,059 MW as on March 31, 2023, with a highly diversified basket of generation.\n\nThere is vast headroom for India to achieve economic progress  and  growth  in  electricity  consumption comparable  to  key  developed  economies.  India's installed  power  capacity  has  grown  substantially over the last thirteen years, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7%. The nation's electricity demand has registered strong growth over the past three years on the back of robust economic growth, spurred by the Government's drive to provide Power To All. Aggregate electricity demand attained 9.6% growth in FY 2022-23 at 1,512 BU over the demand in FY 2021-22. Similarly, peak power demand registered a growth of 6.4% to scale a new peak of 215.9 GW in FY 2022-23, as compared to a peak of 203 GW in FY 2021-22.\n\nIndia  reported  a  slight  increase  in  energy  deficit  to 0.5% in FY2022-23 as compared to 0.4% in FY202122.  However,  the  peak  deficit  for  FY  2022-23 increased to 4.0% as compared to 1.2% in FY 202122, on account of growing power demand. As India's\n\neconomy continues to grow, electricity demand is set to rise further.\n\nIndia's installed power generation capacity growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThermal power continues to be the biggest source of power generated in India, given large coal reserves domestically, lack of natural gas reserves, and limited expansion in other conventional sources.  Coal-fired power  plants  act  as  base-load  power  generators and  are  increasingly supporting operations of renewable energy plants by providing grid-stabilizing power generation.  The  increase  in  coal-fired  power generation has resulted in the availability of reliable and affordable electricity across the country. Electricity  demand  in  the  country  has  increased rapidly  and  is  expected  to  rise  in  the  foreseeable future.\n\nInstalled Capacity as of 31st March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Indian power sector outlook\n\nThe  Government  of  India's  focus  to  attain  'Power for  all'  has  accelerated  capacity  addition  in  the country along with expansion and strengthening of power transmission and distribution networks. The nation still has a long way to go, as per capita annual consumption in the country was 1,255 kWh in FY22, which is significantly lower than world average and that of other developing countries like South Africa and Brazil. However, as India's GDP is expected to grow significantly over next two decades on the back of  demographic  strength,  per  capita  consumption",

        "page_content": "of  electricity  is  expected  to  rise  to  approximately 3000 kWh by 2040. Demand for electricity in India is expected to grow at a sustained pace given the government's massive push towards 'Make-In-India', PLI (Production Linked Incentive) Scheme, increasing industrialization,  improving  incomes  and  standards of living, and push for increasing the penetration of electric vehicles in the transportation sector, among others.\n\nThe 20th Electric Power Survey of India, published in November 2022 by the Ministry of Power projects total  electric  energy  consumption  at  1,610  BU  in 2026-27 and 2,133 BU in 2031-32. The corresponding peak demand is projected at 277 GW and 366 GW by the two years respectively. For comparison, the total electricity demand in 2022-23 was 1,511 BU and peak demand was 216 GW.\n\nOver the longer term, power demand is projected to reach  3,423  BU  by  2041-42  while  peak  demand  is projected at 575 GW. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA)  also  projects  that  India's  likely  Installed Capacity by the end of FY 30 will be around 817 GW, up by around 400 GW as compared to the present Installed Capacity.\n\nThe Government of India has set a target of achieving 50% of the total installed capacity by the year 2030 from  non-fossil  fuels.  The  Optimal  Generation  Mix report published by CEA in April 2022 estimates that by 2029-30, installed capacity of coal and lignitebased power plants (net of retirements) will reach 252 GW. The likely share of thermal installed capacity will reduce to nearly 32% of the total installed capacity in 2029-30 as compared to 57% as of March 2023. However,  in  terms  of  energy  generation,  thermal power will continue to contribute the largest share at 57%, as compared to more than 70% at present.\n\n## Coal demand and supply\n\nCoal  continues  to  be  the  most  important  source of fuel for power plants in India. It represents 51% of the installed capacity and nearly 72% of power generation as of FY 2022-23. Total coal consumption has witnessed consistent growth over the years as coal-based  generation  capacity  continues  to  rise. According to the Indian Ministry of Coal, India's coal demand will rise from 1,029 million tonnes (MT) in FY 2022-23 to 1,448 MT by 2029-30. Of this, the demand of the power sector for coal will increase from 735 MT to 1,034 MT during the same period.\n\nIn FY 2022-23, India's coal production registered a formidable growth of 14.7% to 893 MT compared to 778 MT in FY 2021-22. Coal dispatch to the power\n\nsector by domestic producers increased by 9.1% to 738 MT from 676 MT in this period. On the other hand, imports of non-coking coal increased to 166 MT in FY 2022-23 (Upto Feb'23) from 152 MT in FY 202122, mainly due to high surge in power demand.\n\nHowever, even as the Government targets increasing domestic coal production to 1,304 MT in FY 2024-25, coal imports are set to rise due to a surge in power demand.\n\n## Adani  Power  Limited  (APL):  Delivering  growth responsibly\n\nAPL is India's largest private thermal power producer with  a  power  generation  capacity  of  15,250  MW, consisting  of  15,210  MW  thermal  power  capacity and 40 MW solar power capacity. Of this, 1600 MW capacity (of which 800 MW is already commissioned) caters  to  power  supply  to  Bangladesh,  while  the balance 13,650 MW is being supplied within India. Out of the current and under-construction capacity, 10,840 MW of thermal power capacity, comprising a 4,620 MW plant at Mundra, Kutch in Gujarat, a 3,300 MW plant at Tiroda, Gondia in Maharashtra, a 1,320 MW plant at Kawai, Baran in Rajasthan, and 1,600 MW (under its subsidiary Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited, at Godda in Jharkhand, have been established by the Company.\n\nAPL has also acquired four thermal power plants with a combined capacity of 4,370 MW, including a 1,370 MW plant at Raipur in Chhattisgarh, a 600 MW plant at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh, a 1,200 MW plant at Udupi in Karnataka, and a 1,200 MW plant (under subsidiary Mahan Energen Limited) at Bandhaura, Singrauli  in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe Company is also developing a 2x800 MW Ultrasupercritical power plant in Madhya Pradesh, which will supply power to the State under a 1,230 MW (net),  25-year  Power  Supply  Agreement  (PSA)  with the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Ltd. The power plants of APL and its subsidiaries have specific locational advantages and strengths, which allow them easy access to fuel and connectivity to key markets.\n\nThe  Company  enjoys  a  substantial  competitive advantage due to its ability to conduct sourcing and logistics of 54 million tonnes per annum (MPTA) coal within India and from abroad along with 12 MTPA fly  ash,  which  is  a  complex,  multi-point  operation involving co-ordination of complete movement of up to 13,000 railway rakes a year.\n\nAPL has overcome numerous challenges to emerge as a financially stronger and profitable company.

The  Company's strategically located open capacity near major coal mining regions was able to benefit from the growth in demand and increase in merchant tariffs in the shortterm market due to its proximity to the fuel source, which creates a competitive advantage in terms of logistics cost of fuel.\n\nThe largest contribution to EBITDA growth was from the near-pithead segment, due to higher prior period revenue recognition on account of regulatory orders and  payments  from  customers  in  Tiroda.  EBITDA from  hinterland  plant  reduced  due  to  lower  prior period revenue recognition in Kawai, partially offset by revenue inclusion of newly acquired Mahan plant.

Adani  Power  Maharashtra Limited  ['APML'],  Adani  Power  Rajasthan  Limited ['APRL'],  Adani  Power  (Mundra)  Limited  ['APMuL'], Udupi  Power  Corporation  Limited  ['UPCL'],  Raipur Energen Limited ['REL'], and Raigarh Energy Generation Limited ['REGL'] have been amalgamated with the Holding Company, i.e. APL with effect from 1st  October  2021.  Following  this,  CRISIL  Ratings Limited  and  India  Ratings  Limited  have  affirmed credit rating of 'CRISIL A/Stable' and 'Ind A/Positive' respectively assigned to APL.\n\nThe  amalgamation  is  intended  to  achieve  size, scalability, integration, greater financial strength and flexibility thereby building a more resilient and robust organization  that  can  address  dynamic  business situations and volatility in various economic factors in a focused manner, in order to achieve improved long term financial returns.\n\n## OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## Mundra:\n\nIn  February  2023,  APL  entered  into  Supplemental PPAs  (SPPAs)  with  Haryana  DISCOMs,  wherein  the net contracted capacity under the original PPAs has been reduced from 1424 MW to 1200 MW. This will allow  efficient  recovery  of  alternate  fuel  costs  in case power demand from Haryana DISCOMs exceeds domestic coal availability under the FSA.\n\nFurther, subsequent to the financial year closing date, in  April 2023, the Company has entered into long term PPA of 360 MW (Net) with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL') for supplying power from third unit of Mundra Phase-IV plant which got freed-up due to amendment in Haryana PPA capacity. This will ultimately help in maximum utilization of Mundra's Phase-IV units.\n\n## Tiroda:\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court passed orders in March 2023 and April 2023 in the matters related to domestic coal shortfall suffered by erstwhile APML under the periods governed by New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) and SHAKTI policies. The Hon'ble Court's orders confirm earlier orders of the Hon'ble Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory  Commission  (MERC)  and  the  Hon'ble\n\n## Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (APTEL).\n\nSimilar  to  the  above,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court also passed another order related to de-allocation of Lohara coal block as part of change-in-law, confirming earlier orders of MERC and APTEL.\n\nThese orders will allow the Tiroda plant to recover alternate  coal  costs,  along  with  carrying  cost  and late payment surcharge, arising due to shortfall in domestic coal, under change-in-law clauses of the respective PPAs.\n\n## Human Resource Practices\n\nAt APL, we consider employees as our biggest asset. It is our constant endeavour to upgrade knowledge and skills, enhancing productivity of our employees. The average employee age of the company stood at 37 years, a complement of positive energy, enthusiasm and  experience.  We  offer  significant  importance  to employee safety and wellbeing through various safety initiatives like Chetna that sharpen our employees' skills to create a safe workplace.\n\nThe  Company  has  created  a  valuable  workplace revolving around the principles of capability building, employee engagement, governance and digitalisation. To  ensure  employee  life  cycle  management,  the company implemented Oracle Fusion Digital HR Tool. Learning modules and performance appraisal helped standardise systems on a real-time basis. Competence evaluation  and  development  were  focused  on  all major functions and services.\n\nFocused action plans were emphasized on increased engagement  based  on  the  outcome  of  a  Gallup employee engagement survey.\n\nThe company invested in young talents (GETs & MTs) and sharpened the skills of talented professionals to prepare them for bigger responsibilities rather hiring laterals. APL undertook focused approach to develop and train successors for all critical positions through high potential professionals and young managers.\n\nThe  Company  had  launched  capability  building initiatives under Transition Leadership Programs like Fulcrum, Takshashila and North Star in alliance with leading management institutes.\n\n## Internal control system\n\nThe Company has robust internal control procedures in  place  that  are  commensurate  with  its  size  and operations. The Board of Directors, responsible for the internal control system, sets the guidelines and verifies  its  adequacy,  effectiveness  and  application. The Company's internal control system is designed to ensure management efficiency, measurability and",

The consolidated revenue for FY 2022-23 comprised revenue from operations of H 38,773.30 crore and other income of H 4,267.22 crore as compared to H 27,711.18 crore  and H 3,975.29  crore  respectively  for FY 2021-22. Revenue  from  operations  for FY 2022-23 registered a growth of 39.92% over the previous year due to revival of the Mundra plant's 1,234  MW  Bid-2  Power  Purchase  Agreement ['PPA']  with  Gujarat  Urja  Vikas  Nigam  Limited ['GUVNL']  in  March  2022,  recognition  of  prior period revenue from operations of H 2,580 crore in Tiroda TPP due to favourable regulatory orders in respect of Shortfall in domestic coal, improved tariff realisation due to greater merchant / shortterm demand and higher import coal price, and inclusion of operating results of your Company's wholly owned subsidiary Mahan Energen Limited ['MEL'], which was acquired on 16th March, 2022. Other income for FY 2022-23 registered a growth of 7.34% over the previous year due to higher recognition of prior period other income primarily on account of regulatory orders for carrying costs and collection of late payment surcharges from customers.\n\nYour  Company  sold  53.39  Billion  units  of electricity  during  FY  2022-23  as  against  52.27 Billion units in FY 2021-22 from all the plants with  Plant  Load  Factor  (PLF)  decreasing  from 51.5% in the previous year to 47.9% in FY 2022-23. Capacity under operation increased from 12,450 MW in FY 2021-22 to 13,650 MW in FY 2022-23 following  the  acquisition  of  MEL,  which  owns and operates a 1,200 MW thermal power plant in Singrauli District of Madhya Pradesh.\n\n## b)   Operating and Administrative Expenses\n\nConsolidated Operating and Administrative Expenses during FY 2022-23 were H 28,728.64 crore,  which  have  increased  by  60.52%  from H 17,897.02  crore  in  FY  2021-22.  The  increase is mainly due to higher fuel cost owing to high prices of import coal, and higher other operating expenses including employee benefits expenses. The percentage of Operating and Administrative\n\nExpenses  to  Total  Revenue  has  increased  to 66.75% in FY 2022-23 from 56.48% in FY 2021-22.\n\n## c)   Depreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\nConsolidated Depreciation and  Amortization Expenses  during  FY  2022-23  were H 3,303.68 crore,  which  have  increased  by  5.97%  from H 3,117.54 crore in FY 2021-22 primarily due to the acquisition of MEL.\n\n## d)   Finance Costs\n\nConsolidated Finance Costs during FY 2022-23 were H 3,333.50  crore,  which  have  decreased by  18.59%  from H 4,094.78  crore  in  FY  202122,  mainly  due  to  reduction  in  outstanding loans through prepayment as well as scheduled repayments.\n\n## e)   Tax\n\nConsolidated  Tax  (Credit)  of H 3,267.37  Crore during FY 2022-23 was mainly due to reversal of deferred tax liability and current tax provision as compared to Tax Expense of H 1,744.80 Crore during FY 2021-22.\n\n## f) Total Comprehensive Income for the year\n\nConsolidated  Total  Comprehensive  Income  for FY 2022-23 was higher by 117.15% at H 10,760.38 crore  as  compared  to  Total  Comprehensive Income of H 4,955.21 crore in FY 2021-22.\n\nThe  detailed  operational  performance  of  your Company has been comprehensively discussed in the Management Discussion and Analysis Section which forms part of this Annual Report.\n\n## Credit Rating\n\nThe  Companies  financial  discipline  and  prudence is  reflected  in  the  strong  credit  ratings  ascribed by rating agencies. The details of credit rating are disclosed  in  Corporate  Governance  Report,  which forms part of the Annual Report.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  your  Company  ('Board'), after considering the relevant circumstances holistically  and  keeping  in  view  the  Company's Dividend  Distribution  Policy,  has  decided  that  it would be prudent not to recommend any dividend for the year under review.\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  the  scheme  of amalgamation of Raipur Energen Limited ('REL') and five other wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company ('APL') with APL became effective with effect from 7th  March,  2023.  In  consequence,  the  preference shareholders  of  REL,  holding  4,15,86,207  0.01% compulsorily redeemable preference shares of H 100/-",

The onboarding exercise for all new employees includes Human Rights awareness as part of their induction session. This induction session is held on monthly basis and focuses on aspects of POSH, and Code of Conduct. While the training on different elements of human rights is covered under various awareness and training program organized by the company, we are further strengthening our existing approach to human rights training and engagement including setting up a digital platform for better tracking and recording of hours of trainings conducted on ESG including human rights for different category of employees including workers.",

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\nThe Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. We follow the basic principle of segregation of the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept of 'reduce, reuse & recycle'.\n\nThe hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation.\n\nApart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include scrap metal, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All our site/locations are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible.\n\n- 10.

The invoices for change in law claims are raised considering operational /  cost  parameters  based  on  qualitative  parameters approved  in  terms  of  the  relevant  Regulatory Authorities  Orders  and  are  subject  to  partial  /  final acceptance of the claims by the respective Discoms. Considering that the methodology and the parameters of  claims  are  subject  to  final  acceptance  by  the respective Discoms, the revenue is recognised in the books of account based on the prudent parameters of claims and methodology, till the respective matters are accepted / settled with the Discoms.\n\nThus,  the  revenue/  receivables    from  Discoms  are subject  to  adjustments  to  the  extent  there  may be  adverse  impact  on  account  of  appeals  with  the regulatory authorities.\n\nIn  certain  cases  where  the  regulatory  order(s)  are subject  matter  of  appeal  with  higher  appellate forums / authorities, and the amount of claims are not ascertainable, revenues for change in law claims are not recognised, pending outcome of the final decision.\n\nIn  view  of  the  complexity  and  judgement  involved  in estimation of the amounts of such claims and recoverability thereof, the same is considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  in  response  to  this  key  audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Examined  the  Company's  accounting  policies with respect to assessing compliance with Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n- -Obtained understanding of the key controls that management has in place to monitor change in law events and related claims, status of various pending  claims  including  under  appeals  and orders passed by various regulatory authorities.\n- -Inspected the relevant state regulatory commission, CERC, appellate tribunal and court rulings and examined management assumptions / judgement relating to various parameters in terms of  regulatory  orders,  for  measuring  /  estimating the amount of such claims.\n- -Examined the underlying parameters and assumptions  /  judgement  used  for  measuring  / computing the amounts of compensation claims as  per  regulatory  orders  through  verification  of historical information and other available internal and external data.\n- -Tested  on  sample  basis,  the  accuracy  of  the underlying  data  used  for  computation  of  such claims.\n- -Tested the joint reconciliations for trade receivables  performed  by  the  Company  with the  respective  Discoms,  wherever  available  with underlying records.\n- -Tested the status of the outstanding receivables and  recoverability of the overdue  / aged receivables  through  inquiry  with  management, and collection trends in respect of receivables.\n- -Assessed  the  disclosures  in  accordance  with the  requirements  of  Ind  AS  115  'Revenue  from Contract with Customers'.\n\n## Revenue recognition for regulated power generation business\n\n(Also refer Note 33 to the standalone financial statements)\n\nIn the regulated power generation business of Udupi Thermal  Power  Plant  (Udupi  TPP)  (erstwhile  known as  Udupi  Power  Corporation  Limited),  the  tariff  is determined by the regulator based on cost plus return on equity basis wherein cost is subject to prudential norms.\n\nThe Company invoices its customers on the basis of provisional  approved  tariff  which  is  based  on  Tariff Regulation and is subject to true up adjustment.

Further  the  costs incurred  are  subject  to  prudential  checks  and  the prescribed  norms.  Significant  judgements  are  made in determining the accruals including interpretation of  tariff  regulations.  Further  certain  matters  for disallowance  of  claims  has  been  litigated  by  the Company before higher authorities.\n\nRevenue recognition and accrual of regulatory claims is  a  key  audit  matter  considering  the  significant judgements involved in the determination thereof.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated  the  key  assumptions  used  by  the Company by comparing it with the assumptions in provisional approved tariff order.\n- \u00b7 For  tariff  orders  (including  updated  tariff order)  received  by  the  Company,  assessed the impact recognised by the Company and for  matters  litigated  by  the  Company,  also assessed the management's evaluation of the likely outcome of the dispute based on past precedents.\n- \u00b7 Tested  the  joint  reconciliation  for  invoiced billed and  approved  tariff-based  income performed by the Company with the Discoms, wherever  available  with  underlying  records and adjustments made in books of account as  recoverable/  payable  for  the  respective approved tariff periods.\n- -Assessed  the  disclosures  in  accordance  with the  requirements  of  Ind  AS  115  'Revenue  from Contract with Customers'.\n\n## Evaluation of impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\n(Also refer Note 3(iv) and 47(c) to the standalone financial statements)\n\nAs  at  March  31,  2023,  the  carrying  value  of  the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of the Company (Mundra Thermal Power Plant (TPP) Cash Generating Unit (CGU)) is H 13,706.48 crores (net of government grant).\n\nTo assess if there is an impairment in the carrying value of PPE of Mundra TPP CGU, the management conducts CGU  level  impairment  tests  annually  or  whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that, the carrying value of PPE may require evaluation to verify recoverability. An impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount of PPE is lower than the carrying value.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  the  Mundra  TPP  CGU  is evaluated by calculating the value in use of the CGU to  which  carrying  value  of  PPE  is  attributable  along with the revised SPPA entered with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited ('GUVNL') in terms of Settlement Deed with  the  said  Discom  dated  January  4,  2022,  which has been approved by Hon'ble Supreme Court. Further, the unit has also entered into Supplementary Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) with Haryana discom in February 2023 and long term PPA with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL') to supply power from  Mundra TPP in April  2023.  This  is  a  key  audit  matter  as  the  testing of impairment of carrying value of Mundra TPP PPE is complex and involves significant judgement. .\n\nThe key assumptions involved in impairment test are projected revenue growth, tariff estimate, cost of coal, operating margins, estimated life of PPE and discount rates and terminal value.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  in  response  to  this  key  audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -We  have obtained an understanding the Management's  internal  controls  over  its  annual impairment  assessment  and  key  assumptions applied  such  as  revenue  growth,  operating margins, discount rates, estimated life of PPE and terminal growth rates;\n- -We  obtained  CGU  valuation  model  prepared  by the  management  and  engaged  our  valuation specialists  to  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of valuation  methodology  applied  in  impairment testing and to test the key assumptions around expected long term growth parameters discount rates etc.\n- -We  discussed  potential  changes  in  key  drivers with  management  in  order  to  evaluate  the suitability of inputs and assumptions used in the cash  flow  forecasts  and  performed  sensitivity analysis  around  the  key  assumptions  used  by management.\n- -We have obtained an understanding of impact of  the  revised  agreement  entered  with  GUVNL dated  March  30,  2022,  Haryana  discom  for supplying  the  power  dated    February  28,  2023 and long term PPA entered with MUL for supply of power dated April 14, 2023 having impact on the valuation model.\n- -Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances.  Under  section  143(3)(i)  of  the Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for  expressing  our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our  auditor's  report.  However,  future  events  or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the standalone  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters that  were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should not  be  communicated  in  our  report  because  the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1.

These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient  conduct  of its  business,  including  adherence  to  the  Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness  of  the  accounting  records,  and  the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit  in  accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  on Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit  of  internal  financial  controls  and,  both  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to  these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk. The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for our  qualified  audit  opinion  on  the  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With  Reference  to  these  Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3)",

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  the  internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Qualified Opinion\n\nAccording to the information and explanations given to us and based on our audit, pending completion of the ongoing investigations of Securities and Exchange Board of India and completion of proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in terms of its order dated March  2,  2023  as  stated  in  the  'Basis  for  Qualified Opinion'  paragraph  of  our  audit  report,  and  the consequential  impact  it  may  have  on  Company's processes  and  internal  controls  including  related party  transactions  and  compliance  with  applicable laws and regulations, to that extent we are unable to comment on whether there is any material weakness in  the  Company's  internal  controls  as  at  March  31, 2023.\n\nA 'material weakness' is a deficiency, or a combination of  deficiencies,  in  internal  financial  control  over financial  reporting,  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable possibility  that  a  material  misstatement  of  the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  except  for  the  possible  effects  of the  material  weakness  described  above  on  the\n\nachievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has maintained, in all material respects, adequate  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial  statements  were  operating  effectively  as of  March  31,  2023,  based  on  the  internal  control over  financial  reporting  criteria  established  by  the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\n## Explanatory paragraph\n\nWe  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the Standards  on  Auditing  issued  by  the  Institute  of Chartered  Accountants  of  India,  as  specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act, the standalone financial statements of Adani Power Limited, which comprise the  Balance  Sheet  as  at  March  31,  2023,  and  the related  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  including  the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow  Statement  and  the  Statement  of  Changes  in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information,  and  our  report  dated  May  5,  2023, expressed a qualified opinion.\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\n\n## per Santosh Agarwal\n\nPartner\n\nMembership Number: 093669\n\nUDIN: 23093669BGUYXA8928\n\nPlace of Signature : Ahmedabad\n\nDate: May 5, 2023",

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortisation is recognised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. The Company has intangible assets in the nature of Computer software having useful life of 5 years. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## c Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as asset held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from other items in the balance sheet.\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## d Current versus non-current classification\n\nThe  Company  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  balance  sheet  based  on  current/  non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- \u00b7 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period\n\nThe Company classifies all other assets as non-current.\n\nA liability is current when:\n\n- \u00b7 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle\n- \u00b7 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading",

The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.\n\n## e Financial Instruments\n\nA Financial Instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## f Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis i.e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades).\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\n\n## Classification of Financial assets\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  assets  that  meet  the  following  conditions  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using effective interest method ('EIR') (except for debt instruments that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the  asset  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of financial assets and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial assets, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nInterest is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).",

The net gain or loss recognised in statement of profit and loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## Reclassification of financial assets\n\nThe Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial  recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model. The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.\n\n## Impairment of Financial assets:\n\nThe Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset.\n\nExpected credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate. The Company estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument through the expected life of that financial instrument.\n\nThe Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire,  or  when  it  transfers  the  financial  asset  and  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership of the asset to another party or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in the statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.",

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Unsecured Perpetual Securities\n\nUnsecured perpetual securities ('securities') are the securities with no fixed maturity or redemption and the same are callable only at the option of issuer. These securities are ranked senior only to the equity share capital of the Company and the issuer does not have any redemption obligation hence these securities are recognised as equity as per Ind AS 32.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  in  the  case  of  financial  liabilities  at amortised cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\n## Classification of Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in statement of profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in statement of profit and loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.\n\nFair values are determined in the manner described in note 'o'.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities  that  are  not  held-for-trading  and  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL  are  measured at  amortised  cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent  accounting  periods.  The  carrying  amounts  of  financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the 'Finance costs' line item in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and costs paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised at the transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured  at  amortised  cost.  Similarly,  interest  bearing  loans,  trade  credits  and  borrowings  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method. Further, trade credits include Buyer's credit, Foreign Letter of Credit and Inland Letter of Credit.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company  derecognises  financial  liabilities  when,  and  only  when,  the  Company's  obligations",

An  exchange  with  a  lender  of  debt  instruments  with substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly,  a  substantial  modification  of  the  terms  of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. In case of derecognition of financial liabilities relating to promoters contribution, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in other equity.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value through profit or loss, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## h Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks on borrowings / purchases, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details of derivatives financial instruments are disclosed in note 50.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss immediately, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges (refer note (i)) are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\nReassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## i Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, which mainly includes derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet all of the following requirements :\n\n- -there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments,\n- -the  effect  of  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  that  economic relationship,\n- -the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship,  the  Company  documents  the  relationship  between  the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for",

Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives / hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in the 'Cash Flow Hedge Reserve'.\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Company uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in finance costs.\n\nThe Company designates only the spot element of a forward contract as a hedging instrument. The forward element is recognised in OCI.\n\nThe amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.\n\nFor  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  amount  accumulated  in  OCI  is  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  as reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\n## j Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are accounted for at cost, net of impairment, if any. (Also refer note 3(v)).\n\n## k Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value after providing for obsolence and other losses where considered necessary. Costs include all non-refundable duties and all charges incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on First in First out (FIFO) for coal inventory and on weighted average basis for other than coal inventory. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## l Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits  with  an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less,  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and shortterm deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Company's cash management.\n\n## m  Business combinations and Goodwill\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Company in exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.\n\nA business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and the control is not transitory. The transactions between entities under common control are specifically covered by Ind AS 103. Such transactions are",

The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised at their carrying amounts of the Company's financial statements. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The components of equity of the acquired companies are added to the same components within the Company's equity. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves. The Company's shares issued in consideration for the acquired companies are recognized from the moment the acquired companies are included in these financial statements and the financial statements of the commonly controlled entities would be combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period  presented.\n\nPurchase consideration paid in excess / shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities including  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent  assets,  is  recognised  as  goodwill  /  capital  reserve respectively, except in case where different accounting treatment is specified in the court approved scheme.\n\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefits arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' and Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits' respectively.\n\nPotential  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  and  carry  forwards  of  an  acquiree  that  exist  at  the acquisition date or arise as a result of the acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash-generating units (or company's of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nA cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in statement of profit and loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nOn disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## n Foreign currency translations\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Company, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange  differences  on  monetary  items  are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in  which they arise except for exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe Company has elected to continue the policy adopted for accounting for exchange differences arising from translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding and recognised in the financial statements for the period ending immediately before the beginning of the first Ind AS financial reporting period i.e. 31st March, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.",

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the financial asset or settle the financial liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market, or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nThe  Company's  management  determines  the  policies  and  procedures  for  both  recurring  fair  value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nExternal valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets and financial liabilities and derivatives.\n\nFor  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  recognised  in  the  financial  statements  on  a  recurring  basis,  the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## p Government grants\n\nThe  Company  recognises  government  grants  only  where  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Where Government grants relates to non-monetary assets, the cost of assets are presented at gross value and grant significantly complied thereon is recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss over the useful life of the related assets in proportion in which depreciation is charged.\n\nGrants related to income are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the same period as the related cost which they are intended to compensate are accounted for.",

If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due and the amount is billable. (Refer note 3(viii))\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs obligations under the contract.\n\n## r Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  recognised  when  control  of  the  goods  or  services  are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts and other incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts collected from customers.\n\nThe disclosure of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3 (vii).\n\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\n\n## i) Revenue from Power Supply\n\nThe Company's contracts with customers for the sale of electricity generally include one performance obligation. The Company has concluded that revenue from sale of electricity should be recognised at the point in time when electricity is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue from operations on account of Force Majeure / change in law events in terms of PPAs with customers (Power Distribution Utilities) is accounted for by the Company based on the orders / reports of Regulatory Authorities, best management estimates, wherever needed and reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n\nIn case of PPA under section 62 of Electricity Act, 2003, revenue from sale of power is recognised based on the most recent tariff order approved by the CERC, as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (\"APTEL\"), to the extent applicable, having regard to mechanism provided in applicable tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the customers. Where the tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## ii) Sale of traded goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of traded goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customers, which generally coincides with the delivery of goods.\n\n- iii) Carrying cost in respect of claims for change in law of taxes and duties, additional cost incurred on procurement of alternative coal and on other claims are recognised upon approval by relevant regulatory authorities, best management estimates and based on reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.",

Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing cost consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing cost.\n\n## t Employee benefits\n\n## i) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees (in some cases funded through Group Gratuity Scheme of Life Insurance Corporation of India). The Company accounts for the liability for the gratuity benefits payable in future based on an independent actuarial valuation carried out using Projected Unit Credit Method.\n\nDefined  benefit  costs  in  the  nature  of  current  and  past  service  cost  and  net  interest  expense or income are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (excluding amounts included in net interest or the net defined benefit liability) and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurement are not classified to statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods. Past service cost is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment.\n\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss:\n\n- \u00b7 Service  costs  comprising  current  service  costs,  past-service  costs,  gains  and  losses  on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and\n- \u00b7 Net interest expense or income\n\n## ii) Defined contribution plan:\n\nRetirement Benefits in the form of Provident Fund and Family Pension Fund which are defined contribution schemes are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period in which the contributions to the respective funds accrue as per relevant statues.\n\n## iii)  Compensated Absences:\n\nProvision  for  Compensated  Absences  and  its  classifications  between  current  and  non-current liabilities are based on independent actuarial valuation.

The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\nRental income from operating leases is generally recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the Company's expected inflationary cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nThe Company recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company records the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application and right of use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepayments/accruals recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Company also applied the available practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- \u00b7 Used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n- \u00b7 Relied  on  its  assessment  of  whether  leases  are  onerous  immediately  before  the  date  of  initial application\n- \u00b7 Applied the short-term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease\n\n## v Taxes on Income\n\nTax on Income comprises current tax and deferred tax. These are recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Current tax\n\nTax including Minimum Alternative Tax('MAT') on income for the current period is determined on the basis of estimated taxable income and tax credits computed in accordance with the provisions of the relevant tax laws and based on the expected outcome of assessments / appeals. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the",

Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nMinimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the statement of profit and loss as current tax for the year. The deferred tax asset is recognised for MAT credit available only to the extent that it is probable that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Company recognizes MAT credit as an asset, it is created by way of credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown as part of deferred tax asset.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized for the future tax consequences of deductible temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred tax liability arises at the time of transaction that affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credit and unused tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences arising at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the statement of profit and loss is recognized outside the statement of profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n## w  Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual  Securities  whether  declared  or  not)  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual Securities whether declared or not) as adjusted for the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the dilutive potential equity shares by weighted average number of shares plus dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## x Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.",

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\nA  contingent  liability  is  a  possible  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events  whose  existence  will  be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\nContingent liabilities may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims against the Company. Where it is management's assessment that the outcome is uncertain or cannot be reliably quantified, the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent assets  are  not  recognised  but  are  disclosed  in  the  notes  where  an  inflow  of  economic benefits is probable.\n\nA contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value. Subsequently, it is  measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\n## y Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit ('CGU') is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than it's carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budget and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Company's cash-generating unit to which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budget / forecasts, the Company estimates cash flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying",

A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## z Mine Development Expenditure :\n\n- i) Expenditure  incurred  towards  coal  mines  under  construction  are  capitalised  to  'Coal  Mines under construction' as long as they meet the capitalisation criteria  and  is  presented  as  capital work-in-progress. Upon commencement of production stage, the 'Coal Mines under construction' is capitalised and presented as 'Mining Rights' under Intangible Assets except in situation when the Company decide to surrender its rights in mine and amount is classified as recoverable from Nominated Authorities.\n- ii) Mining Rights are amortised using unit-of-production method on the basis of proven and probable reserves on commencement of commercial production.\n\n## Mine Closure Obligations :\n\nThe liability for meeting the mine closure has been estimated based on the mine closure plan in the proportion of total area exploited to the total area of the mine as a whole. These costs are updated annually during the life of the mine to reflect the developments in mining activities. The mine closure obligations are included in Mining Rights under Intangible assets and amortised based on unit of production method.\n\n## 3  Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions thereto are recognised in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods. Uncertainties about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key Sources of estimation uncertainty :\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nIn case of the power plant assets, where the life of the assets has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account the estimated usage of the asset and the current operating condition of the asset, depreciation on the same is provided based on the useful life of each component based on technical assessment, if materially different from that of the main asset.\n\n## ii) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nIn  estimating  the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  the  Company  uses  market observable  data  to  the  extent  available.  Where  such  Level  1  inputs  are  not  available,  the  Company establishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value",

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 55.\n\n## iii)  Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe  cost  of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan  and  the  present  value  of  the  gratuity  obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All  assumptions  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date.  Information  about  the  various  estimates  and assumptions made in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 58.\n\n## iv)  Impairment of non financial assets\n\nFor  determining  whether  property,  plant  and  equipments  and  goodwill  are  impaired,  it  requires  an estimation of the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. The value in use calculation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, change in law claims, operational performance of the Plants, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management. (Refer note 47).\n\n## v) Investments made / Loans given to subsidiaries\n\nIn case of investments made and Intercorporate Deposits ('ICD') given by the Company to its subsidiaries, the Management assesses whether there is any indication of impairment in the value of investments and ICDs.  The  carrying  amount  is  compared  with  the  present  value  of  future  net  cash  flow  of  the subsidiaries, as applicable.\n\n## vi)  Taxes\n\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies, including estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Deferred tax assets is recognised to the extent of the corresponding deferred tax liability. (Also refer note 24).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n## vii)  Income / Revenue\n\nRevenue from Operations on account of Force Majeure / Change in Law events or Other Income on account of carrying cost in terms of Power Purchase Agreements with various State Power Distribution Utilities is accounted for / recognised by the Company based on best management estimates following principles  of  prudence,  as  per  the  orders  /  reports  of  Regulatory  Authorities,  and  the  outstanding receivables thereof in the books of account may be subject to adjustments on account of final orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ('Hon'ble Supreme Court') and final closure of the matters with the respective Discoms. (Refer note 33 and 34).\n\nIn certain cases, the Company has claimed compensation from the Discoms based on management's interpretation of the regulatory orders and various technical parameters, which are subject to final verification and confirmation by the respective Discoms, and hence, in these cases, the revenues have been recognised during various financial years / periods, on a prudent basis with conservative attributable",

(Refer note 33 and 34).\n\n## viii) Classification of Trade Receivables :\n\nIn cases of circumstances / matters where there are pending litigations on regulatory matters / change in law claims, the classification of disputed / undisputed trade receivables is a matter of judgement based on facts and circumstances. The Company has evaluated the fact pattern and circumstances, including ongoing discussions with the Discoms, for each such regulatory matter pending to be adjudicated by the relevant authority.\n\nIn cases, where rule of law and principles of economic restitution have already been established by APTEL / Supreme Court in similar matters, the revenues are recognised on prudent and conservative technical parameters, significant amounts have been recovered already and the management does not perceive any downside risks in future on final adjudication by Supreme Court and settlement of matter with Discoms, the related receivables are classified as undisputed.\n\nIn  cases, where discussions with Discoms have not made reasonable progress and matters are subjudice, the related receivables are classified as disputed, even though the management is reasonably confident of recovering the dues in full, backed by the regulatory orders in favour of the Company.\n\nThe management will continue to monitor the developments on regulatory claims.\n\n## ix)  Mega Power Status :\n\nOne of the thermal power plant has availed exemption of customs / excise duty in pursuance to terms of the provisional mega power policy as notified by the Government of India. The Company has not recongnised for the reduction in cost to property, plant and equipment as a grant, pending compliance of terms of Mega Power Status which needs to be attained within 156 months, from the date of import of plant and equipment as per approval by the Ministry of Power (\"MoP\"), Government of India vide amendment dated 7th April, 2022. The management is of the view that the Company will comply with the grant conditions within the specified time. The Company will recognise grant to the extent of the duty waiver availed in the year of receipt of final mega power status to said thermal power plant or corresponding liability if any on expiry of the time lines specified in the MoP approval.",

The said benefits were availed by virtue of SEZ approval granted to the Power Plant in December 2006, in terms of the provisions of the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the 'SEZ Act') and the Special Economic Zone Rules, 2006 which entitled the Power Plant to procure goods and services without payment of taxes and duties as referred above.\n\nThe Company in respect of Tiroda thermal power plants ('Tiroda TPP') and Kawai thermal power plants ('Kawai TPP') have availed tax and duty benefit in the nature of exemptions from Custom Duty and Excise Duty on its project procurements. The said benefits were availed by virtue of power plants being designated as Mega Power Project in accordance with the policy guidelines issued in this regard by the Ministry of Power, Government of India which entitled Tiroda TPP and Kawai TPP to procure goods and services without payment of taxes and duties as referred above.\n\nSince, the procurement of goods and services during the project period were done by availing the exemption from payment of aforesaid taxes and duties, the amount capitalised for the said power plant as on the put to use date, is cost of property, plant and equipment (PPE) net off tax and duty benefit availed. In compliance with Ind AS 20 - 'Government Grant', Mundra TPP, Kawai TPP and Tiroda TPP have opted to gross up the value of its PPE by the amount of tax and duty benefit / credit availed after considering the same as government grant. The amount of said government grant (net off accumulated depreciation) as on the transition date has been added to the value of PPE with corresponding credit made to the deferred government grant. The amount of grant is amortised over useful life of PPE along with depreciation on PPE. The amount of deferred liability is amortised over the useful life of the PPE with credit to statement of profit and loss classified under the head 'Other Income'.\n\nThe Company has Government grant balance (net) of H 4,487.33 Crores till 31st March, 2023 (Previous year H 4,791.40 Crores).\n\n- iii)  Cost of Property Plant and Equipment includes carrying value recognised as deemed cost as of 1st April, 2015, measured as per previous GAAP and cost of subsequent additions.\n- iv)  During the year, an amount of H 33.97  Crores  was  expensed  out  of  carrying  amount  of  Capital  Work  in Progress towards impairment of project cost.\n- v)  During the previous year, an amount of H 55.57  Crores  was  transferred  from  balance  of  Capital  Work  in Progress to Other non current financials assets - Others.

The Company is restricted from assigning and subleasing the said leased assets.\n\nviii)  In November 2007, the Company obtained Land under lease from Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (Lessor) for its Udupi TPP for 11 years from the date of agreement whose validity period of Lease Agreement was further extended from Lessor till 11th September, 2022. As at year end, in terms of lease agreement, the Company is in the process to exercise its option to get the lease deed converted to sale deed as the terms and conditions of land allotment has been fulfilled. Since the entire amount of H 76.64 Crores which was considered in Lease-cum-Sale Agreement is considered as a sale consideration on expected transfer, the Company has not provided amortization on said land.\n\n## ix) Capital Work-In-Progress Ageing schedule:\n\n## a.  as at 31st March 2023\n\n| Capital Work In Progress   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n|                            | Less than 1  year                | 1-2 years                        | 2-3 years                        | More than 3  years               |         |\n| Projects in progress       | 98.00                            | 31.19                            | -                                | 59.14                            | 188.33  |\n| Total                      | 98.00                            | 31.19                            | -                                | 59.14                            | 188.33  |\n\n## b.  as at 31st March 2022\n\n| Capital Work In Progress   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Amount in CWIP for a period of   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n|                            | Less than 1  year                | 1-2 years                        | 2-3 years                        | More than 3  years               |         |\n| Projects in progress       | 87.69                            | 1.11                             | 0.27                             | 95.23                            | 184.30  |\n| Total                      | 87.69                            | 1.11                             | 0.27                             | 95.23                            | 184.30  |\n\nThe Company do not have any capital-work-in progress whose completion is overdue or has exceeded its cost compared to its original plan except below.\n\n## c.

The Management expects to acquire additional land from the government authorities and has already obtained in principle approval from railway authorities for the said project. Post acquisition of the additional land, the management will update the estimate and assumption of the original completion plan of the assets. Further, given that demand of power is expected to be higher compared with generation capacity available in the industry, the development of asset forming part of Capital Work-In-Progress will have economic viability for the Company. Further, during the year, the Company has expensed cost of Capital Work in Progress of H 33.97 Crores.\n\n## x) Title deeds of immovable properties (including Right to Use Assets) not held in name of the company as at 31st March, 2023:\n\n| Relevant line item in  the Balance sheet   | Description of item  of property                             |   Gross  carrying  value | Title deeds held in  the name of                            | Whether title deed  holder is a promoter,  director or relative of  promoter/director or  employee of promoter/ director   | Property held  since which  date          | Reason for not being  held in the name of the  company                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Property, Plant and  Equipment             | Land -

In case of delayed payments apart from carrying cost on settlement of claims, the Company is entitled to receive interest as per the terms of PPAs. Hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\n- iv)  Trade receivables includes Customers' bills discounted of H 1,192.50 Crores (Previous year H 1,000.00 Crores).\n- v) Also refer note 33 and 52.\n- vi)  The fair value of Trade receivables are approximately the carrying value presented (Also refer note 54).",

The relief was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ('APTEL') vide its order dated 5th October, 2020, although the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ('MSEDCL') had filed an appeal in the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the APTEL order. The Hon'ble Supreme Court after issuing interim relief order dated 31st January, 2022 passed the final order dated 20th April, 2023 upheld all the matters which were concluded in the APTEL order. Pursuant to said Hon'ble Supreme Court order, the Company has reassessed the compensation claims recognised till date and recognised an additional revenue of H 321.71 Crores (net off reversal of Carrying Cost of H 10.98 Crores) at the year end (including H 201.21 Crores pertaining to earlier period).\n\nThe total tariff compensation claim recognised for year ended 31st March, 2023 is H 3,916.48 Crores (including carrying cost H 487.15 Crores). The Company has recognised tariff compensation claims on best estimate basis and management expects to fully realise outstanding balances of such claims from the discoms.\n\n- (b)  In a matter relating to tariff compensation claim (including carrying costs thereon) for additional costs incurred by the Company for 2500 MW power generation capacity at Tiroda TPP, due to shortfall in availability of domestic coal under New Coal Distribution Policy ('NCDP') and Scheme of Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India ('SHAKTI') policy of the government, the Company had earlier received favorable orders from MERC, based on which the Company has recognised claims and carrying cost thereon in earlier years, on best estimate basis. Subsequently, APTEL vide its orders dated 14th and 28th September, 2020 provided further clarity on the various claim parameters to be considered in computing tariff compensation claims. However, MSEDCL had filed an appeal with the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the aforesaid orders of APTEL. The Hon'ble Supreme court after issuing interim relief order dated 31st January, 2022 passed its final order dated 3rd March 2023 and 20th April, 2023 upheld all the matters which were concluded in the APTEL orders towards compensation claims relating to NCDP and SHAKTI policy respectively. Pursuant to said Hon'ble Supreme Court orders",

In terms of the same, the Company has availed exemptions of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth H 960.01 Crores and pledge of margin money deposits of H 59.67 Crores. The grant of final Mega power status of Raipur TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding and the balance through regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up for supply of power as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months from the date of Import, till 12th September, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated 7th April, 2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and hence no adjustments are made.",

However, owing to non-availability of PPA, which as per management is beyond the control of the Company, Raipur TPP was not in a position to utilise the LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA, for which PGCIL has raised demand of H 154.50 Crores towards relinquishment charges on the Company. However, the said claim will be subject to the outcome of the petition dated 7th September, 2020 filed by the Company before the APTEL.\n- 2) For the Company's Udupi TPP and Tiroda TPP, matter on Custom Duty relating to March 2012 to February 2013 is contested at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal ('CESTAT').\n- 3) In  case  of  Raigarh  TPP,  Chief  Electrical  Inspector,  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  ('CEIG'),  has  raised demand for electricity duty on auxiliary power consumption @15% of tariff instead of @ 10% as per the circular dated 12th August, 2016 from January 2015 to December 2021 along with interest. During the current year, the Company has received favourable order from Chief Electrical Inspector, Raipur Office in the matter dated 1st June, 2022.\n- 4)  For company's Tiroda TPP, Joint Commissioner of State Tax (Adm), Nagpur Division, has raised demand of Value added tax relating to FY 13-14 along with interest.\n- ii) Apart from above, the Development Commissioner, Mundra has issued a show cause notice to the Company in case of Mundra TPP for the period FY 2009-10 to FY 2014-15 in relation to custom duty on raw materials used for generation of electricity supplied from SEZ to DTA, which amounts to H 963.94 Crores. The Company has contested the said show cause notice. Further, the management is of the view that such duties on raw material are eligible to be made good to Mundra TPP under the PPA with Discoms or are refundable from the Authorities. Hence, the Company has not considered this as contingent liabilities.\n- iii) The Company has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources will be required in respect of above matters.\n\n|                                                                                                                           | As at  31st March, 2023   | As at  31st March, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (b) Commitments :                                                                                                         |                           |                           |\n| Estimated  amount  of  contracts  remaining  to  be  executed  on  capital account and not provided for (net of advances) | 7,809.65                  | 174.93                    |\n| Total                                                                                                                     | 7,809.65                  | 174.93                    |\n\n## Note:\n\nAs at 31st March, 2023, capital commitment mainly includes commitment relating to Flue Gas Desulphurisation project.\n\n## Others:\n\n- (i) The Company has given a commitment to lenders of Mahan Energen Limited (MEL) that it will not transfer its 49% equity holding in MEL outside the Adani Power Group, except with the prior approval of lenders.\n\n## 42 Leases\n\nThe Company has lease contracts for land, Building and computer hardware used in its operations.

The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated 17th September, 2021, accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along with  obligation  to  fulfil  antecedent  liability.  On  29th  September  2021,  the  Hon'ble  Delhi  High  Court,  in response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. Further the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its order dated 3rd March, 2022, instructed the Nominated authority that the said performance bank guarantee shall be returned within one week from the date of execution of 'Letter of Intent of Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement' with a new bidder. The Nominated Authority has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on 13th September, 2022 and allotted mine to new bidder on 13th September, 2022.\n\nEarlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of mine with Nominated Authority, however based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority. The Company has also obtained legal opinion basis which it is reasonably confident to get compensation realised of the entire costs incurred towards the development of the coal mine in the subsequent period.\n\n- 45 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited ('REL') has incurred cost of H 55.57 Crores and H 30.75 Crores towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in the earlier years.\n\nIn the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon'ble Delhi High Court requesting surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India's ('UoI') notification dated 16th April, 2015 stating capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid security. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated 15th April, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon'ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon'ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated 30th May, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken in these matters.\n\nThe management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.\n\n- 46 The National Green Tribunal (\"NGT\") in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating to  Udupi  TPP  directed  the  Company vide its  order  dated  14th  March,  2019,  to  make  payment  of H 5.00 Crores as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board (\"CPCB\"), which was deposited by the Company with CPCB under protest, in April 2019 and expensed the same in the books.\n\nNGT vide its order dated 31st May, 2022 settled the matter and directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of H 47.02 Crores with CPCB within 3 months from the date of order. The Company has recognised expense provision in the books of H 47.02 Crores on conservative basis. The Company has filed petition with the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 26th August, 2022 against the above referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at reporting date.\n\n- 47 (a)  In respect of Power Purchase Agreement ('PPA / SPPA') for Bid 2 with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited ('GUVNL'), for supply of 1,234 MW power through Mundra TPP (as amended), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide its order dated 2nd July, 2019, had allowed appeal filed by the Company, for termination of long term PPA / SPPA with retrospective effect from the date of PPA i.e. 2nd February, 2007 and allowed the Company to claim compensatory tariff. Till reporting period ended 31st December, 2021, GUVNL was in appeal in the matter with Hon'ble Supreme Court and had filed the curative petition.",

CERC vide its order dated 13th June 2022 recommended the base energy tariff rates for final approval of GoG which is pending as on reporting date. CERC order allows the Company and GUVNL to mutually agree on adoption of six monthly or monthly escalation index to apply over base energy tariff rate as on October 2018 for determination of subsequent period energy rates. Pending approval of the base energy tariff rate by GoG and the mutual agreement between the Company and GUVNL on methodology for escalation index, the Company has made adjustments in the revenue of H 269.09 Crores based on prudent principles with conservative parameters. Presently, revenue in this matter has been recognised based on pass through of coal cost in a prudent and consistent basis as concluded through Supplemental Agreement dated 30th March, 2022.\n\n- (b)  On 28th February 2023, a Supplemental Power Purchase Agreements ('SPPA') has ben signed with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited and Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (collectively 'Haryana DISCOMs') in respect of its two existing Power Purchase Agreements ('PPA') of net contracted capacity of 712 MW each (1424 MW in aggregate at Generation end). Under the terms of the SPPAs, the net capacity contracted with Haryana DISCOMs has been reduced to 600 MW each, or 1200 MW in aggregate, as delivered. This development allowed the Company to schedule power supply to Haryana DISCOMs using two dedicated Units of 660 MW each instead of all three units of Phase IV of Mundra TPP.  This  will  also  allow  efficient  recovery  of  alternate  fuel  costs  in  case  of  demand  from  Haryana DISCOMs exceeds domestic coal availability under the FSA. Further on 14th April, 2023, the Company has entered into long term PPA of 360 MW with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL') to be supplied from third unit of Mundra TPP Phase-IV.\n\nThe management believes that with majority of the tariff compensation claim issues relating to GUVNL and Haryana Discoms have been resolved, over a foreseeable future Mundra TPP of the Company would be able to establish profitable operations and meet its performance and financial obligations. Hence, based on the assessment of value in use of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP related property, plant and equipment aggregating to H 16,200.47 Crores as at 31st March, 2023.\n\n- (c)  The  Company  has  determined  the  recoverable  amounts  of  the  Power  Plants  (including  goodwill allocated to respective Power Plants) over their useful lives based on the Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\") identified,  as  required  under  Ind  AS  36,  Impairment  of  Assets  on  the  basis  of  their  Value  in  Use  by estimating the future cash inflows over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, availability of domestic coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n\nOn a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has concluded that the recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at 31st March 2023. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n\n- 48 In  respect of Mundra TPP, the Company has claimed tariff compensation claim (including carrying cost thereon) for additional cost incurred related to power generation against 1424 MW of Power Purchase Agreement due to shortfall in domestic coal based on supplies under Fuel Supply Agreements with Collieries of Coal India Limited's subsidiaries, against power supplied to Haryana Discoms based on favourable CERC Order dated 31st May, 2018 and 13th June, 2019 duly upheld by APTEL order dated 3rd November, 2020 and 30th June, 2021. However, Haryana Discom had filed an appeal with the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the",

The Hon'ble Supreme Court after issuing interim relief order dated 16th February, 2021 passed its final orders dated 20th April, 2023 upheld all the matters which were concluded in the APTEL order towards tariff compensation claims relating to NCDP and SHAKTI policy respectively.\n\nBased on final order of Hon'ble Supreme Court, there is no significant change in tariff compensation claims recognised on best estimate as per the orders of CERC / APTEL and management expects to fully realise outstanding balances of such claims from the discom.\n\n- 49 GUVNL vide its letter dated 21st May, 2021 has raised certain claims on the Company for excess energy injected during the period 1st April, 2017 to 31st October, 2020 from the 40 MW solar power plant at Bitta in terms of the power purchase agreement and has withheld H 72.10 Crores against power supply dues in the previous year. GERC vide its order dated 3rd November, 2022 in the matter accepting the petition of the Company in the said matter and directed GUVNL to make payment of the amount withheld within three months from the date of order along with late payment surcharge as per PPA. However, GUVNL has filed an appeal with APTEL against the said order of GERC and the matter is pending adjudication. The management, based on GERC order, expects favourable outcome in the matter. As per interim order of APTEL, the Company has already received H 51.75 Crores being 75% of the withheld amount subject to outcome of appeal with APTEL. The Management expects favourable resolution of this matter and is reasonably confident to realise the outstanding dues.\n- 50 The Company has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on  items  including  principal  loan  amount  and  interest  thereof  along  with  interest  rate  changes.

The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company's policies and risk objectives.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i)  Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of  changes  in  market  prices.  Market  risk  comprises  three  types  of  risk:  interest  rate  risk, currency risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the part of Company's debt obligations with floating interest rates.\n\nThe Company manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points on the exposure of borrowings (having fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of H 20,735.47 Crores as on 31st March, 2023 and H 23,494.30 Crores as on 31st March, 2022 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the Company's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows:\n\n|                                                  |   For the year ended  31st March, 2023 |   For the year ended  31st March, 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year |                                 103.68 |                                 117.48 |\n| Impact on Equity                                 |                                 103.68 |                                  97.69 |\n\n## b) Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's operating activities and borrowings. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to realise in future. The Company also enters into various foreign exchange hedging contracts such as forward covers, swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or trade payables.\n\nEvery one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S.dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 56.53 million as on 31st March, 2023 and $ 87.48 million as on 31st March, 2022 would have affected the Company's profit or loss for the year as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                               |   For the year ended  31st March, 2023 |   For the year ended  31st March, 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Impact  on  Profit  or  Loss  before  tax  for  the  year  (net  of  amounts capitalised under Property, Plant and Equipment) |                                   4.65 |                                   6.63 |\n| Impact on Equity                                                                                                              |                                   4.65 |                                   6.62 |",

Its operating / trading activities require the on-going purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Company monitors its purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost.\n\n## (ii)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\nThe Company is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\nThe Company has issued financial guarantees to banks on behalf of and in respect of loan facilities availed by its subsidiaries. In accordance with the policy of the Company, the Company has recognised these financial guarantees as liability at fair value (Refer note 22 and 29). Outstanding loans in the subsidiaries against the financial guarantee contracts given by the Company as at 31st March, 2023 is H 9,477.45 Crores (Previous year H 7,522.52 Crores).\n\n## (iii) Liquidity  risk\n\nThe Company monitors its risk of shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models.

On 31st March, 2023, MCA amended the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules,  2015  by  issuing  the  Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from 1st April, 2023, as below:\n\n## Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThe amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n## Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nThe amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition  of  a  change  in  accounting  estimates  has  been  replaced  with  a  definition  of  accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n## Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nThe  amendments  clarify  how  companies  account  for  deferred  tax  on  transactions  such  as  leases  and decommissioning  obligations.  The  amendments  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  recognition  exemption  in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.",

The  invoices  for change in law claims are raised considering operational /  cost  parameters  based  on  qualitative  parameters approved  in  terms  of  the  relevant  Regulatory Authorities  Orders  and  are  subject  to  partial/  final acceptance of the claims by the respective Discoms. Considering that the methodology and the parameters of  claims  are  subject  to  final  acceptance  by  the respective Discoms, the revenue is recognised in the books  of  account  based  on  the  prudent  parameters and  methodology,  till  the  respective  matters  are accepted / settled with the Discoms.\n\nThus,  the  revenue/  receivables  from  Discoms  are subject  to  adjustments  to  the  extent  there  may be  adverse  impact  on  account  of  appeals  with  the regulatory authorities.\n\nIn  certain  cases  where  the  regulatory  order(s)  are subject  matter  of  appeal  with  higher  appellate forums / authorities, and the amount of claims are not ascertainable, revenues for change in law claims are not recognised, pending outcome of the final decision.\n\nIn  view  of  the  complexity  and  judgement  involved in  estimation  of  the  amounts  of  such  claims  and recoverability thereof, the same is considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  in  response  to  this  key  audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Examined  the  Group's  accounting  policies  with respect  to  assessing  compliance  with  Ind  AS  115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'\n- -Obtained  understanding  of  the  key  controls  that management has in place to monitor change in law  events  and  related  claims,  status  of  various pending claims including under appeals and orders passed by various regulatory authorities.\n- -Inspected the relevant state regulatory commission,  CERC,  appellate  tribunal  and  court rulings and examined management assumptions / judgement relating to various parameters in terms of regulatory orders, for measuring / estimating the amount of such claims.\n- -Examined the underlying parameters and assumptions  /  judgement  used  for  measuring  / computing the amounts of compensation claims as  per  regulatory  orders  through  verification  of historical information and other available internal and external data.\n- -Tested  on  sample  basis,  the  accuracy  of  the underlying  data  used  for  computation  of  such claims.\n- -Tested the joint reconciliations for trade receivables performed  by  the  Group  with  the  respective Discoms, wherever  available with underlying records.\n- -Tested the status of the outstanding receivables and recoverability of the overdue / aged receivables through inquiry with management, and collection trends in respect of receivables.\n- -Assessed the disclosures  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n\n## Revenue recognition for regulated power generation business\n\n(Also refer Note 32 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nIn the regulated power generation business of Udupi Thermal  Power  Plant  (Udupi  TPP)  (erstwhile  known as  Udupi  Power  Corporation  Limited),  the  tariff  is determined by the regulator based on cost plus return on equity basis wherein cost is subject to prudential norms.\n\nThe Company invoices its customers on the basis of provisional  approved  tariff  which  is  based  on  Tariff Regulation and is subject to true up adjustment. As the Company is entitled to tariff based on actual cost incurred for the year,  at point of revenue recognition it  recognises  adjustments  for  the  escalation/  deescalation in the various parameters compared to the entitled parameters.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  in  response  to  this  key  audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Examined the Company's accounting policies with respect  to  assessing  compliance  with  Ind  AS  115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n- -Performed test of controls over revenue recognition and accruals through inspection of evidence of performance of these controls.\n- -Performed  the  tests  of  details  including  the following key procedures:\n- \u00b7 Evaluated  the  key  assumptions  used  by  the Company by comparing it with the assumptions in provisional approved tariff order.",

Further  the  costs incurred  are  subject  to  prudential  checks  and  the prescribed  norms.  Significant  judgements  are  made in determining the accruals including interpretation of  tariff  regulations.  Further  certain  matters  for disallowance  of  claims  has  been  litigated  by  the Company before higher authorities.\n\nRevenue recognition and accrual of regulatory claims is  a  key  audit  matter  considering  the  significant judgements involved in the determination thereof.\n\n- \u00b7 For tariff orders (including updated tariff order) received by the Company, assessed the impact recognised by the Company and for matters litigated by the Company, also assessed the management's evaluation of the likely outcome of the dispute based on past precedents.\n- \u00b7 Tested  the  joint  reconciliation  for  invoiced billed and approved tariff-based income performed by the Company with the Discoms, wherever  available  with  underlying  records and  adjustments  made  in  books  of  account as  recoverable/  payable  for  the  respective approved tariff periods.\n- -Assessed the disclosures  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n\nEvaluation of impairment of property, plant and equipment (Also refer Note 3(iv) and 51(c) to the consolidated\n\n## financial statements)\n\nAs  at  March  31,  2023,  the  carrying  value  of  the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of the Company (Mundra Thermal Power Plant (TPP) Cash Generating Unit (CGU)) is H 13,706.48 crores (net of government grant).\n\nTo assess if there is an impairment in the carrying value of PPE of Mundra TPP CGU, the management conducts CGU  level  impairment  tests  annually  or  whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that, the carrying value of PPE may require evaluation to verify recoverability. An impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount of PPE is lower than the carrying value.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  the  Mundra  TPP  CGU  is evaluated by calculating the value in use of the CGU to  which  carrying  value  of  PPE  is  attributable  along with the revised SPPA entered with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited ('GUVNL') in terms of Settlement Deed with  the  said  Discom  dated  January  4,  2022,  which has been approved by Hon'ble Supreme Court. Further, the unit has also entered into Supplementary Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) with Haryana discom in February 2023 and long term PPA with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL') to supply power from Mundra TPP in April  2023.  This  is  a  key  audit  matter  as  the  testing of impairment of carrying value of Mundra TPP PPE is complex and involves significant judgement.\n\nThe key assumptions involved in impairment test are projected revenue growth, tariff estimate, cost of coal, operating margins, estimated life of PPE and discount rates and terminal value.\n\nOur  audit  procedures  in  response  to  this  key  audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -We have obtained an understanding the Management's  internal  controls  over  its  annual impairment  assessment  and  key  assumptions applied such as revenue growth, operating margins, discount rates, estimated life of PPE and terminal growth rates;\n- -We obtained CGU valuation model prepared by the management and engaged our valuation specialists to  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  valuation methodology  applied  in  impairment  testing  and to test the key assumptions around expected long term growth parameters, discount rates etc.\n- -We discussed potential changes in key drivers with management in order to evaluate the suitability of inputs and assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts and performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions used by management.\n- -We have obtained an understanding of impact of the revised agreement entered with GUVNL dated March 30, 2022, Haryana discom for supplying the power dated February 28, 2023 and long term PPA entered with MUL for supply of power dated April 14, 2023 having impact on the valuation model.\n- -Assessed the disclosures  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Ind AS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.",

The  other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  our knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit  or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  Holding  Company's  Board  of  Directors  is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of  the  consolidated  financial  position,  consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income,  consolidated  cash  flows  and  consolidated statement  of  changes  in  equity  of  the  Group  in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  specified  under  section  133  of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board  of  Directors  of  the  company  (ies)  included in  the  Group  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective company (ies) and for preventing and detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection and  application  of  appropriate  accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent;  and  the  design,  implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation\n\nof  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  give a  true  and  fair  view  and  are  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, the  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the  companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective company (ies) to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  of  accounting  unless  management  either intends to liquidate the respective company (ies) or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies included  in  the  Group  are  also  responsible  for overseeing  the  financial  reporting  process  of  their respective company (ies).\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement, whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the",

Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast significant  doubt  on  the  ability  of  the  Group  to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor's  report  to  the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our  auditor's  report.  However,  future  events or  conditions  may  cause  the  Group  to  cease  to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence regarding the financial information of the entities  or  business  activities  within  the  Group of  which  we  are  the  independent  auditors  and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements,  which  have  been  audited  by  other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them.

We describe these matters in our auditor's  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes public  disclosure  about  the  matter  or  when,  in extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a matter should not be communicated in our report because  the  adverse  consequences  of  doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\n- (a)  We  did  not  audit  the  financial  statements and  other  financial  information,  in  respect  of twelve  subsidiaries,  whose  financial  statements include total assets of H 16,259.53 crores as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of H 173.46 crores  and  net  cash  inflows  of H 141.41  crores for the year ended on that date. These financial statement  and  other  financial  information  have been audited by other  auditors,  which  financial statements,  other  financial  information  and auditor's reports have been furnished to us by the management. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries and our report in terms of subsections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on the report(s) of such other auditors.\n- (b)  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include unaudited financial statements and other unaudited financial information  in  respect  of  one  subsidiary,  which was  acquired  and  disposed  off  during  the  year,",

These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation and maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls  that  were  operating effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective  company's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of its  assets,  the  prevention  and  detection  of  frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records,  and  the  timely  preparation  of reliable  financial  information,  as  required  under  the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting  with  reference  to  these  consolidated financial statements  based  on  our  audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over\n\nFinancial  Reporting  (the  'Guidance  Note')  and  the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Act,  to  the extent  applicable  to  an  audit  of  internal  financial controls.  Those  Standards  and  the  Guidance  Note require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference to  these  consolidated  financial  statements  was established  and  maintained  and  if  such  controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with reference to these consolidated financial statements and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with reference to these consolidated financial statements, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the assessed  risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on the  auditor's  judgement,  including  the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in  terms  of  their  reports  referred  to  in  the  Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with  reference  to  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting  with  reference  to  these  consolidated",

A company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial reporting  with  reference  to  these  consolidated financial  statements  includes  those  policies  and procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these  consolidated  financial  statements,  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these  consolidated  financial  statements  to  future periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  the  internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial statements may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Qualified Opinion\n\nAccording to the information and explanations given to us and based on our audit, pending completion of\n\nthe ongoing investigations of Securities and Exchange Board of India and completion of proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in terms of its order dated March  2,  2023  as  stated  in  the  'Basis  for  Qualified Opinion'  paragraph  of  our  audit  report,  and  the consequential  impact  it  may  have  on  Company's processes  and  internal  controls  including  related party  transactions  and  compliance  with  applicable laws and regulations, to that extent we are unable to comment on whether there is any material weakness in  the  Company's  internal  controls  as  at  March  31, 2023.\n\nA 'material weakness' is a deficiency, or a combination of  deficiencies,  in  internal  financial  control  over financial  reporting,  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable possibility  that  a  material  misstatement  of  the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  except  for  the  possible  effects  of the  material  weakness  described  above  on  the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has maintained, in all material respects, adequate  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting  with  reference  to  these  Consolidated financial  statements  and  such  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference to  these  Consolidated  financial  statements  were operating  effectively  as  of  March  31,  2023,  based on  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\n## Explanatory paragraph\n\nWe  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the Standards  on  Auditing  issued  by  the  Institute  of Chartered  Accountants  of  India,  as  specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act, the consolidated financial statements  of  Adani  Power  Limited  (hereinafter referred to as 'the Holding Company'), its subsidiaries (the  Holding  Company and its subsidiaries together referred  to  as  'the  Group')  comprising  of  the consolidated Balance sheet as at March 31 2023, the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including",

The parent company, Adani Power Limited and the subsidiaries (together referred to as ''the Group'') sell power generated from these projects under a combination of long term Power Purchase Agreements ('PPA'), Medium term PPA, Short term PPA and on merchant basis and also engaged in trading, investment and other business activities. Information on the Group's structure is provided in Note 40.\n\nAs at 31st March, 2023, S. B. Adani Family Trust (\"SBAFT\") together with entities controlled by it, has the ability to control the Group. The Group gets synergetic benefit of the integrated value chain of Adani group.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  were  approved  for  issue  in  accordance  with  a  resolution  of  the directors on 5th May, 2023.\n\n## 2  Significant accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) read with section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 and presentation requirements of Division II of schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in INR ( H ), which is also the parent company's functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest Crores, except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of consolidation\n\n## a Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by it as at 31st March, 2023. Control is achieved when the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 has power over the investee;\n- \u00b7 is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- \u00b7 has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\n\nWhen the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee  when  the  voting  rights  are  sufficient  to  give  it  the  practical  ability  to  direct  the  relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the size of the Company's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;\n- \u00b7 potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;",

Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from  the  date  the  Company  gains  control  until  the  date  when  the  Company  ceases  to  control  the subsidiary.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nConsolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances,  appropriate  adjustments  are  made  to  that  Group  member's  financial  statements  in preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  ensure  conformity  with  the  Group's  accounting policies.\n\nThe financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e. year ended on 31 March.\n\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Changes in the Group's ownership interests in existing subsidiaries\n\nChanges in  the  Group's  ownership  interests  in  subsidiaries  that  do  not  result  in  the  Group's  losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable Ind AS).\n\n## 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## a Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at original cost grossed up with the amount of tax / duty benefits  availed,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Other Indirect expenses relating to the project activities, incurred during the project development period, net of income earned during the period till commercial operation date of the project, are recorded as indirect project expenses and disclosed as a part of Capital Work-in-Progress. Properties / projects in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. All costs, including borrowing costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, is capitalised along with respective asset. Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.\n\nWhen significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives.",

The useful life of property, plant and equipment is considered based on life prescribed in schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in case of power plant assets, where the life has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account, the estimated usage of the assets and the current operating condition of the assets. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.

Provision for R&R costs are provided at  the  present  value  of  expected  costs  to  settle  the  obligation  using  estimated  cash  flows  and  are recognised as part of the cost of the land. The cash flows are discounted at a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the R&R liability. The unwinding of the discount as well as payments made/adjustments is expensed as incurred cost and recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated future costs of R&R are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Subsequent costs are depreciated over the residual life of the respective assets. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortisation is recognised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. The Group has intangible assets in the nature of Computer software having useful life of 5 years. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## c Investment properties\n\n## Recognition and initial measurement\n\nInvestment properties are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at their cost of acquisition. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing cost if  capitalization  criteria  are  met  and  directly  attributable  cost  of  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working condition for the intended use. Any trade discount and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred.\n\nThough the  Group  measures  investment  property  using  cost-based  measurement,  the  fair  value  of investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based on an annual valuation performed  by  an  accredited  external  independent  valuer  who  holds  a  recognised  and  relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.\n\n## Subsequent measurement (depreciation and useful lives)\n\nDepreciation on investment properties is provided on the straight-line method, computed on the basis of useful lives prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. In case of leasehold properties, the same is depreciated over the lease period.",

The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised as other operating income in statement of profit and loss in the period of de-recognition.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as asset held for sale.

Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades).\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\n\n## Classification of Financial assets\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  assets  that  meet  the  following  conditions  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using effective interest method ('EIR') (except for debt instruments that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of financial assets and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial assets, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nInterest is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are measured initially as well as at the end of each reporting date at fair value, recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\n- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- b) The contractual terms of the asset that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payment of principal and interest.",

The net gain or loss recognised in statement of profit and loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## Reclassifcation of Financials Assets\n\nThe Group determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. A change in the business model occurs when the Group either begins or ceases to perform  an  activity  that  is  significant  to  its  operations.  If  the  Group  reclassifies  financial  assets,  it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model. The Group does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.\n\n## Impairment of Financials Assets\n\nThe Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset.\n\nExpected credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate. The Company estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument through the expected life of that financial instrument.\n\nThe Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in consolidated other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in the statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.\n\n## h Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments",

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Unsecured Perpetual Securities\n\nUnsecured perpetual securities ('securities') are the securities with no fixed maturity or redemption and the same are callable only at the option of issuer. These securities are ranked senior only to the equity share capital of the Company and the issuer does not have any redemption obligation hence these securities are recognised as equity as per Ind AS 32.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  in  the  case  of  financial  liabilities  at amortised cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\n## Classification of Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in statement of profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.\n\nFair values are determined in the manner described in note 'o'.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities  that  are  not  held-for-trading  and  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL  are  measured at  amortised  cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent  accounting  periods.  The  carrying  amounts  of  financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the 'Finance costs' line item in consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and costs paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised at the transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured  at  amortised  cost.  Similarly,  interest  bearing  loans,  trade  credits  and  borrowings  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method. Further, trade credits include Buyer's credit, Foreign Letter of Credit and Inland Letter of Credit.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

In case of derecognition of financial liabilities relating to promoters contribution, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid / payable is recognised in other equity.\n\n## i Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate  and  foreign  exchange  rate  risks  as  borrowings  /  purchase,  including  foreign  exchange  forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details of derivatives financial instruments are disclosed in note 53.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss.\n\nReassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## j Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments, which mainly includes derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet all of the following requirements :\n\n- -there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments,\n- -the  effect  of  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  that  economic relationship,\n- -the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives / hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in the 'Cash Flow Hedge Reserve'.\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in finance costs.\n\nThe Group designates only the spot element of a forward contract as a hedging instrument.

If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.\n\nFor  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  amount  accumulated  in  OCI  is  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  as reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\n## k Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value after providing for obsolence and other losses where considered necessary. Costs include all non-refundable duties and all charges incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on First in First out (FIFO) for coal inventory and on weighted average basis for other than coal inventory. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## l Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits  with  an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less,  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group's cash management.\n\n## m  Business combinations and Goodwill\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.\n\nA business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and the control is not transitory. The transactions between entities under common control are specifically covered by Ind AS 103. Such transactions are accounted for using the pooling-of-interest method. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised at their carrying amounts of the Company's financial statements. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The components of equity of the acquired companies are added to the same components within the Company's equity. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves. The Company's shares issued in consideration for the acquired companies are recognized from the moment the acquired companies are included in these financial statements and the financial statements of the commonly controlled entities would be combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period  presented.\n\nPurchase consideration paid in excess / shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities including  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent  assets,  is  recognised  as  goodwill  /  capital  reserve respectively, except in case where different accounting treatment is specified in the court approved scheme.\n\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefits arrangements",

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly  in  profit  or  loss.  An  impairment  loss  recognised  for  goodwill  is  not  reversed  in  subsequent periods.\n\nOn disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## n Foreign currency translations\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Group, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange  differences  on  monetary  items  are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in  which they arise except for exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe Group has elected to continue the policy adopted for accounting for exchange differences arising from translation of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding and recognised in the financial statements for the period ending immediately before the beginning of the first Ind AS financial reporting period i.e. 31st March, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.\n\n## o Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives and mutual funds at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the financial asset or settle the financial liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market, or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic",

Where Government grants relates to non-monetary assets, the cost of assets are presented at gross value and grant significantly complied thereon is recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss over the useful life of the related assets in proportion in which depreciation is charged.\n\nGrants related to income are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the same period as the related cost which they are intended to compensate are accounted for.\n\n## q Contract Balances\n\n## Contract assets\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due and the amount is billable.

Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts collected from customers.\n\nThe disclosure of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3 (vi).\n\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\n\n## i Revenue from Power Supply\n\nThe Group's contracts with customers for the sale of electricity generally include one performance obligation. The Group has concluded that revenue from sale of electricity should be recognised at the point in time when electricity is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue from operations on account of Force Majeure / change in law events in terms of PPAs with customers (Power Distribution Utilities) is accounted for by the Group based on the orders / reports of Regulatory Authorities, best management estimates, wherever needed and reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n\nIn case of PPA under section 62 of Electricity Act, 2003, revenue from sale of power is recognised based on the most recent tariff order approved by the CERC, as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ('APTEL'), to the extent applicable, having regard to mechanism provided in applicable tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the customers. Where the tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## ii) Sale of traded goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of traded goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customers, which generally coincides with the delivery of goods.\n\n- iii) Carrying cost in respect of claims for change in law of taxes and duties, additional cost incurred on procurement of alternative coal and on other claims are recognised upon approval by relevant regulatory authorities, best management estimates and based on reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n- iv)  Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis at the effective interest rate ('EIR') applicable.\n- v) Dividend  income  from  investments  is  recognised  when  the  Group's  right  to  receive  payment  is established.\n- vi)  Late payment surcharge on delayed payment for power supply is recognised based on receipt / collection from customers or on acceptance / acknowledgement by the customers whichever is earlier.\n\n## s Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended",

Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (excluding amounts included in net interest or the net defined benefit liability) and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurement are not classified to statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods. Past service cost is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment.\n\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss:\n\n- \u00b7 Service  costs  comprising  current  service  costs,  past-service  costs,  gains  and  losses  on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and\n- \u00b7 Net interest expense or income\n\n## ii) Defined contribution plan:\n\nRetirement Benefits in the form of Provident Fund and Family Pension Fund which are defined contribution schemes are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period in which the contributions to the respective funds accrue as per relevant statues.\n\n## iii)  Compensated Absences:\n\nProvision  for  Compensated  Absences  and  its  classifications  between  current  and  non-current liabilities are based on independent actuarial valuation.

Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group records the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application and right of use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepayments/accruals recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group also applied the available practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- \u00b7 Used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n- \u00b7 Relied  on  its  assessment  of  whether  leases  are  onerous  immediately  before  the  date  of  initial application\n- \u00b7 Applied the short-term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease\n\n## v Taxes on Income\n\nTax on Income comprises current tax and deferred tax. These are recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Current tax\n\nTax including Minimum Alternative Tax ('MAT') on income for the current period is determined on the basis of estimated taxable income and tax credits computed in accordance with the provisions of the relevant tax laws and based on the expected outcome of assessments / appeals. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nMinimum alternate tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the statement of profit and loss as current tax for the year. The deferred tax asset is recognised for MAT credit available only to the extent that it is probable that the Group will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Group recognizes MAT credit as an",

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred tax liability arises at the time of transaction that affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credit and unused tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences arising at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the statement of profit and loss is recognized outside the statement of profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n## w  Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual  Securities  whether  declared  or  not)  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual Securities whether declared or not) as adjusted for the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the dilutive potential equity shares by weighted average number of shares plus dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## x Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of  a  past  event,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost\n\nA  contingent  liability  is  a  possible  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events  whose  existence  will  be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be",

Where it is management's assessment that the outcome is uncertain or cannot be reliably quantified, the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent assets  are  not  recognised  but  are  disclosed  in  the  notes  where  an  inflow  of  economic benefits is probable.\n\nA contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value. Subsequently, it is  measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\n## y Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit ('CGU') is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than it's carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nThe Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budget and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's cash-generating unit to which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budget / forecasts, the Company estimates cash flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss.\n\n## z Mine Development Expenditure :\n\n- i) Expenditure  incurred  towards  coal  mines  under  construction  are  capitalised  to  'Coal  Mines under construction' as long as they meet the capitalisation criteria  and  is  presented  as  capital work-in-progress.

These costs are updated annually during the life of the mine to reflect the developments in mining activities. The mine closure obligations are included in Mining Rights under Intangible assets and amortised based on unit of production method.\n\n## 3  Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions thereto are recognised in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods. Uncertainties about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key Sources of estimation uncertainty :\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nIn case of the power plant assets, where the life of the assets has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account, the estimated usage of the asset and the current operating condition of the asset, depreciation on the same is provided based on the useful life of each component based on technical assessment, if materially different from that of the main asset.\n\n## ii) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nIn estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group uses market observable data  to  the  extent  available.  Where  such  Level  1  inputs  are  not  available,  the  Group  establishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 58.\n\n## iii)  Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe  cost  of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan  and  the  present  value  of  the  gratuity  obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and",

All  assumptions  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date.  Information  about  the  various  estimates  and assumptions made in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 59.\n\n## iv)  Impairment of non financial assets\n\nDetermining  whether  property,  plant  and  equipments  and  goodwill  are  impaired,  it  requires  an estimation of the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. The value in use calculation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, change in law claims, operational performance of the Plants, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management. (Refer note 51).\n\n## v) Taxes\n\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies, including estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Deferred tax assets is recognised to the extent of the corresponding deferred tax liability. (Also refer note 23).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n## vi)  Income / Revenue\n\nRevenue from Operations on account of Force Majeure / Change in Law events or Other Income on account of carrying cost in terms of Power Purchase Agreements with various State Power Distribution Utilities is accounted for / recognised by the Group based on best management estimates following principles  of  prudence,  as  per  the  orders  /  reports  of  Regulatory  Authorities,  and  the  outstanding receivables thereof in the books of account may be subject to adjustments on account of final orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ('Hon'ble Supreme Court') and final closure of the matters with the respective Discoms. (Refer note 32 and 33).\n\nIn  certain  cases,  the  Group  has  claimed  compensation  from  the  Discoms  based  on  management's interpretation of the regulatory orders and various technical parameters, which are subject to final verification and confirmation by the respective Discoms, and hence, in these cases, the revenues have been recognised during various financial years / periods, on a prudent basis with conservative attributable parameters in the books. The necessary true-up adjustments for revenue claims (including carrying cost / delayed payment surcharge) are made in the books on final acknowledgement / regulatory orders / settlement of matters with respective Discoms or eventual recovery of the claims, whichever is earlier.\n\nIn case of Udupi TPP, Revenue from sale of power is recognised upon judgement by the management for recoverability of the claims based on the relevant contractual terms / provisional tariff rates as provided by the regulator / governing tariff regulations, to the extent applicable, having regard to mechanism provided  in  applicable  tariff  regulations  and  the  bilateral  arrangement  with  the  customers,  which may be subject to adjustments in future years, on receipt of final orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities or final closure of the matter with the customers. (Refer note 32 and 33).\n\n## vii)  Classification of Trade Receivables :\n\nIn cases of circumstances / matters where there are pending litigations on regulatory matters / change in law claims, the classification of disputed / undisputed trade receivables is a matter of judgement based on facts and circumstances. The Group has evaluated the fact pattern and circumstances, including ongoing discussions with the Discoms, for each such regulatory matter pending to be adjudicated by the relevant authority.",

The Management expects to acquire additional land from the government authorities and has already obtained in principle approval from railway authorities for the said project. Post acquisition of the additional land, the management will update the estimate and assumption of the original completion plan of the assets. Further, given that demand of power is expected to be higher compared with generation capacity available in the industry, the development of asset forming part of Capital Work-In-Progress will have economic viability for the Company.\n\nFurther, during the year, the Company has expensed cost of Capital Work in Progress of H 33.97 Crores.\n\n## e.

In case of delayed payments apart from carrying cost on settlement of claims, the Group is entitled to receive interest as per the terms of PPAs. Hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\n- iv)  Trade receivables includes Customers' bills discounted of H 1,192.50 Crores (Previous year H 1,000.00 Crores).\n- v) Also refer note 32 and 55.\n- vi) The fair value of Trade receivables approximate the carrying value presented.

Pursuant to said Hon'ble Supreme Court order, the Company has reassessed the compensation claims recognised till date and recognised an additional revenue of H 321.71 Crores (net off reversal of Carrying Cost of H 10.98 Crores) at the year end (including H 201.21 Crores pertaining to earlier period).\n\nThe total tariff compensation claim recognised for year ended 31st March, 2023 is H 3,916.48 Crores (including carrying cost H 487.15 Crores).

In terms of the same, the Company has availed exemptions of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth H 960.01 Crores and pledge of margin money deposits of H 59.67 Crores. The grant of final Mega power status of Raipur TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding and the balance through regulated  market  within  stipulated  time.  The  time  period  to  achieve  tie  up  for  supply  of  power  as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months from the date of Import, till 12th September, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated 7th April, 2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and hence no adjustments are made.\n- (b)   In case of Raipur TPP, the Company had entered into a bulk power transmission agreement ('BPTA') with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited ('PGCIL') dated 31st March, 2010 as per which the Company was granted Long term Access ('LTA') of 816 MW. However, owing to non-availability of PPA, which as per management is beyond the control of the Company, Raipur TPP was not in a position to utilise the LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA, for which PGCIL has raised demand of H 154.50 Crores towards relinquishment charges on the Company. However, the said claim will be subject to the outcome of the petition dated 7th September, 2020 filed by the Company before the APTEL.\n- 2) For the Company's Udupi TPP and Tiroda TPP, matter on Custom Duty relating to March 2012 to February 2013 is contested at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal ('CESTAT').\n- 3) In case of Raigarh TPP, Chief Electrical Inspector, Government of Chhattisgarh ('CEIG'), has raised demand for electricity duty on auxiliary power consumption @15% of tariff instead of @ 10% as per the circular dated 12th August, 2016 from January 2015 to December 2021 along with interest. During the current year, the Company has received favourable order from Chief Electrical Inspector, Raipur Office in the matter dated 1st June, 2022.\n- 4)  For company's Tiroda TPP, Joint Commissioner of State Tax (Adm), Nagpur Division, has raised demand of Value added tax relating to FY 13-14 along with interest.\n- 5) In case of  APJL, Water resource department ('WRD'), Jharkhand has charged penalty on the amount of penalty on water charges which has not been accepted by APJL as per the terms of agreement and the matter is under discussion with WRD to reconsider the demand.\n- 6)  In  case  of    MEL,  MEL  relinquished  the  long-term  transmission  agreement  for  supply  of  power  through Mahan  -  Sipat  transmission  line  in  April  2017,  which  was  accepted  by  Central  Transmission  Utility Ltd  ('CTUIL').  In  this  regard,  CERC  vide  its  tariff  determination  order  dated  14th  March,  2022  imposed",

Subsequently, MEL filed a review petition stating that no additional charges are leviable, as the transmission line was relinquished. Moreover, MEL also filed an appeal in this matter with the APTEL.  While the matter is pending final adjudication, APTEL vide its interim order dated 24th January, 2023 instructed MEL to make interim payments, till the appeal is finally disposed of wherein MEL has made payment of H 86.76 Crore under protest, till the reporting date.During Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ('CIRP') of MEL, no claim on the matter has been ascertained by NCLT while approving the Scheme filed by the Company. As per legal opinion obtained by MEL, it has a fair case on merit. Accordingly, no impact towards the said claim has been given in the books of account.\n\n- ii) Apart from above, the Development Commissioner, Mundra has issued a show cause notice to the Company in case of Mundra TPP for the period FY 2009-10 to FY 2014-15 in relation to custom duty on raw materials used for generation of electricity supplied from SEZ to DTA, which amounts to H 963.94 Crores. The Company has contested the said show cause notice. Further, the management is of the view that such duties on raw material are eligible to be made good to Mundra TPP under the PPA with Discoms or are refundable from the Authorities. Hence, the Company has not considered this as contingent liabilities.\n- iii) The Group has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources will be required in respect of above matters.\n\n## (b)  Commitments :\n\n|                                                                                                                   | As at  31st March, 2023   | As at  31st March, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital  account and not provided for (net of advances) | 8,674.54                  | 2,193.51                  |\n| Total                                                                                                             | 8,674.54                  | 2,193.51                  |\n\nAs at 31st March, 2023, capital commitment mainly includes commitment relating to Flue Gas Desulphurisation project.\n\n## Others :\n\n- (i) The Company has given a commitment to lenders of Mahan Energen Limited ('MEL') that it will not transfer its 49% equity holding in MEL outside the Adani Power Group, except with the prior approval of lenders.\n\n## 44 Leases\n\nThe Group has lease contracts for land, Building and computer hardware used in its operations.

The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated 17th September, 2021, accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along with  obligation  to  fulfil  antecedent  liability.  On  29th  September  2021,  the  Hon'ble  Delhi  High  Court,  in response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. Further the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its order dated 3rd March, 2022, instructed the Nominated authority that the said performance bank guarantee shall be returned within one week from the date of execution of 'Letter of Intent of Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement' with a new bidder. The Nominated Authority has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on 13th September, 2022 and allotted mine to new bidder on 13th September, 2022.\n\nEarlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of mine with Nominated Authority, however based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority. The Company has also obtained legal opinion basis which it is reasonably confident to get compensation realised of the entire costs incurred towards the development of the coal mine in the subsequent period.\n\n- 48 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited ('REL') has incurred cost of H 55.57 Crores and H 30.75 Crores towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in the earlier years.\n\nIn the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon'ble Delhi High Court requesting surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India's ('UoI') notification dated 16th April, 2015 stating capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid security. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated 15th April, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon'ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon'ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated 30th May, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken in these matters.\n\nThe management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.\n\n- 49 The Government of India conducted bidding for allocation of coal blocks, under the coal block auction process whereby MEL acquired the rights of Tokisud Coal Block (in the state of Jharkhand) on 18th March, 2015. Subsequently, in the month of April 2015, by way of a notification, Ministry of Power put cap on the fixed/capacity charges due to which MEL had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi for impugning the above referred notification and also offered to return the said coal block to the Government of India against return of the performance security in the form of Bank Guarantee of H 261.76 Crores provided by MEL and moneys paid, without any penalty.\n\nHowever,  Hon'ble  High  Court  vide  its  judgement  dated  15th  April  2019  dismissed  the  petition  of  MEL. Subsequently, MEL has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the order of the Hon'ble High Court. Meanwhile, the bank guarantee of H 261.76 Crores had been invoked by the Nominated Authority.\n\nThe Union Ministry of Coal has re-allocated the said coal block to National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) for commercial mining. MEL had incurred a total of H 491.62 Crores towards development of tokisud coal mine. Nominated authority vide order dated 16th March, 2022 determined H 163.23 crores being the total compensation payable by successful allottee (NMDC) to MEL. The said amount has been received during the year. During the pendency of the matter in Supreme Court, MEL has fully provided for the balance receivable of H 328.41 crores during the previous year.",

The Company has recognised expense provision in the books of H 47.02 Crores on conservative basis. The Company has filed petition with the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 26th August, 2022 against the above referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at reporting date.\n\n- 51 (a)  In respect of Power Purchase Agreement ('PPA / SPPA') for Bid 2 with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited ('GUVNL'), for supply of 1,234 MW power through Mundra TPP (as amended), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide its order dated 2nd July, 2019, had allowed appeal filed by the Company, for termination of long term PPA / SPPA with retrospective effect from the date of PPA i.e. 2nd February, 2007 and allowed the Company to claim compensatory tariff. Till reporting period ended 31st December, 2021, GUVNL was in appeal in the matter with Hon'ble Supreme Court and had filed the curative petition.\n- On 3rd January 2022, a settlement deed was entered between the Company and GUVNL to resolve all  pending matters / disputes relating to Bid 1 & Bid 2 and as per the Settlement deed followed by Supplemental  Power  Purchase  Agreement  dated  30th  March,  2022,  GUVNL  approached  CERC  to determine the base energy tariff rates for power sales under Bid 1 & Bid 2 SPPAs, with retrospective effect from 15th October, 2018, for submission to the Government of Gujarat ('GoG'). CERC vide its order dated 13th June 2022 recommended the base energy tariff rates for final approval of GoG which is pending as on reporting date. CERC order allows the Company and GUVNL to mutually agree on adoption of six monthly or monthly escalation index to apply over base energy tariff rate as on October 2018 for determination of subsequent period energy rates. Pending approval of the base energy tariff rate by GoG and the mutual agreement between the Company and GUVNL on methodology for escalation index, the Company has made adjustments in the revenue of H 269.09 Crores based on prudent principles with conservative parameters. Presently, revenue in this matter has been recognised based on pass through of coal cost in a prudent and consistent basis as concluded through Supplemental Agreement dated 30th March, 2022.\n- (b)  On 28th February 2023, a Supplemental Power Purchase Agreements ('SPPA') has ben signed with Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited and Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (collectively 'Haryana DISCOMs') in respect of its two existing Power Purchase Agreements ('PPA') of net contracted capacity of 712 MW each (1424 MW in aggregate at Generation end). Under the terms of the SPPAs, the net capacity contracted with Haryana DISCOMs has been reduced to 600 MW each, or 1200 MW in aggregate, as delivered. This development allowed the Company to schedule power supply to Haryana DISCOMs using two dedicated Units of 660 MW each instead of all three units of Phase IV of Mundra TPP.  This  will  also  allow  efficient  recovery  of  alternate  fuel  costs  in  case  of  demand  from  Haryana DISCOMs exceeds domestic coal availability under the FSA. Further on 14th April, 2023, the Company has entered into long term PPA of 360 MW with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL') to be supplied from third unit of Mundra TPP Phase-IV.",

However,  Haryana  Discom  had filed  an  appeal  with  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  against  the  aforesaid  order  of  APTEL  although the  Company  had  recognised  revenue  supported  by  favourable  order  in  respect  of  similar  other matters.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  after  issuing  interim  relief  order  dated  16th  February,  2021 passed its  final  orders  dated  20th  April,  2023  upheld  all  the  matters  which  were  concluded  in  the APTEL  order  towards  tariff  compensation  claims  relating  to  NCDP  and  SHAKTI  policy  respectively. Based on final order of Hon'ble Supreme Court, there is no significant change in tariff compensation claims recognised on best estimate as per the orders of CERC / APTEL and management expects to fully realise outstanding balances of such claims from the discom.\n\nThe management believes that with majority of the tariff compensation claim issues relating to GUVNL and Haryana Discoms have been resolved, over a foreseeable future Mundra TPP of the Company would be able to establish profitable operations and meet its performance and financial obligations. Hence, based on the assessment of value in use of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP related property, plant and equipment aggregating to H 16,200.47 Crores as at 31st March, 2023.\n\n- (c)  The Group has determined the recoverable amounts of the Power Plants (including goodwill allocated to  respective  Power  Plants)  over  their  useful  lives  based  on  the  Cash  Generating  Units  ('CGUs') identified,  as  required  under  Ind  AS  36,  Impairment  of  Assets  on  the  basis  of  their  Value  in  Use  by estimating the future cash inflows over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, availability of domestic coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n\nOn a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Group has concluded that the recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at 31st March 2023. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n\n- 52 GUVNL vide its letter dated 21st May, 2021 has raised certain claims on the Company for excess energy injected during the period 1st April, 2017 to 31st October, 2020 from the 40 MW solar power plant at Bitta in terms of the power purchase agreement and has withheld H 72.10 Crores against power supply dues in the previous year. GERC vide its order dated 3rd November, 2022 in the matter accepting the petition of the Company in the said matter and directed GUVNL to make payment of the amount withheld within three months from the date of order along with late payment surcharge as per PPA. However, GUVNL has filed an appeal with APTEL against the said order of GERC and the matter is pending adjudication. The management, based on GERC order, expects favourable outcome in the matter. As per interim order of APTEL, the Company has already received H 51.75 Crores being 75% of the withheld amount subject to outcome of appeal with APTEL. The Management expects favourable resolution of this matter and is",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## for the year ended 31st March, 2023\n\nAll amounts are in H Crores, unless otherwise stated\n\n## 54 Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :\n\nThe  Group's  risk  management  activities  are  subject  to  the  management  direction  and  control  under  the framework of Risk Management Policy as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i)  Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the part of Group's debt obligations with floating interest rates.\n\nThe Group manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn  case  of  fluctuation  in  interest  rates  by  50  basis  points  on  the  exposure  of  borrowings  (having fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of H 21,985.47 Crores as on 31st March, 2023 and H 24,815.86 Crores as on 31st March, 2022 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the Group's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows:\n\n|                                                  |   For the year ended  31st March, 2023 |   For the year ended  31st March, 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year |                                 109.93 |                                 124.08 |\n| Impact on Equity                                 |                                 109.93 |                                 104.3  |\n\n## b) Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group's operating activities and borrowings. The Group manages its  foreign  currency  risk  by  hedging  transactions  that  are  expected  to  realise  in  future.  The  Group manages its foreign currency risk by entering into currency swap for converting INR loan into other foreign currency for taking advantage of lower cost of borrowing in stable currency environment. The Group also  enters  into  various  foreign  exchange  hedging  contracts  such  as  forward  covers,  swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or trade payables.\n\nEvery one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S.dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 234.08 million as on 31st March, 2023 and $ 353.40 million as on 31st March, 2022 would have affected the Group's profit or loss for the year as follows:",

Its operating / trading activities require the on-going purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Group monitors its purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost\n\n## (ii)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\nThe Group is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\n## (iii)  Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group monitors its risk of shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations. The Group's objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure. A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through internal accruals as well as adequately adjusting the working capital cycle and additional support from promoter group companies on need basis.\n\n## Maturity profile of financial liabilities :\n\nThe table below has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial liabilities including interest that will be paid on those liabilities upto the maturity of the instruments.\n\n| As at 31st March, 2023      | Carrying  Amount   | Less than  1 year   | 1 to 5  years   | More than  5 years   | Total     |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Borrowings                  | 42,252.05          | 11,954.46           | 30,776.86       | 13,145.76            | 55,877.08 |\n| (Refer note 19 and 25)      |                    |                     |                 |                      |           |\n| Trade Payables              | 3,079.45           | 3,079.45            | -               | -                    | 3,079.45  |\n| Derivative Instruments      | 7.04               | 7.04                | -               | -                    | 7.04      |\n| Lease liabilities           | 97.48              | 15.54               | 47.85           | 308.94               | 372.33    |\n| Other Financial Liabilities | 2,454.54           | 2,454.54            | -               | -                    | 2,454.54  |\n\n| As at 31st March, 2022              | Carrying  Amount   | Less than  1 year   | 1 to 5  years   | More than  5 years   | Total                 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Borrowings   (Refer note 19 and 25) | 48,795.68          | 13,795.22           | 31,913.34       |                      | 19,140.56   64,849.12 |\n| Trade Payables                      | 3,508.21           | 3,508.21            | -               | -                    | 3,508.21              |\n| Derivative Instruments              | 27.92              | 18.61               | 9.31            | -                    | 27.92                 |\n| Lease liabilities                   | 102.75             | 14.61               | 51.36           | 319.64               | 385.61                |\n| Other Financial Liabilities         | 2,099.77           | 1,148.71            | 951.06          | -                    | 2,099.77              |",

On 31st March, 2023, MCA amended the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules,  2015  by  issuing  the  Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from 1st April, 2023, as below:\n\n## Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThe  amendments  require  companies  to  disclose  their  material  accounting  policies  rather  than  their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n## Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nThe amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition  of  a  change  in  accounting  estimates  has  been  replaced  with  a  definition  of  accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n## Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nThe  amendments  clarify  how  companies  account  for  deferred  tax  on  transactions  such  as  leases  and decommissioning  obligations.  The  amendments  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  recognition  exemption  in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\n\n- 74. The Group does not have any transaction to report against the following disclosure requirements as notified by MCA pursuant to amendment to Schedule III:\n- 1. Crypto Currency or Virtual Currency\n- 2. Benami Property held under Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988)\n- 3. Registration of charges or satisfaction with Registrar of Companies\n- 4. Related to Borrowing of Funds:\n- i. Wilful defaulter\n- ii. Utilization of borrowed fund and share premium\n- iii. Discrepancy in utilization of borrowings\n- iv. Discrepancy in information submitted towards borrowings obtained on the basis of security of current assets",

To  ensure  un-interrupted operations  and  power  supply  to  its  customers, and considering highly uncertain and volatile coal market, MEL intends to enter into an arrangement with Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) for procuring domestic coal, in normal course and in emergent situations. AEL is one of the largest traders of coal in India. Arrangement with AEL will ensure timely and quality coal supply to the Company. Domestic Coal to be procured from AEL shall be at an ExWorks price prevailing for such coal in the open market based on the market rate, as determined by E-auction of domestic coal by subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd. or rate as per other source of supply in  domestic  market.  The  purchase  transaction would be in the commercial / beneficial interest of the Company. In all cases, the price and terms of the transactions shall be at arm's length as per the CUP (Comparable Uncontrolled Price) method and in the normal course of business.\n\n## ii. Purchase of Power\n\nDue  to  non-availability  of  any  of  the  plant  on some occasions during the year, MEL may procure power  from  alternative  sources  to  fulfil  its obligation under PPAs and in absence of trading license,  MEL  is  required  to  purchase  power through  AEL  being  holder  of  trading  license. AEL  will  arrange  power  at  a  market  discovered price and add trading margin of 0.25 paisa per kwh.,  which  is  regulated  by  CERC.  Accordingly, the  transaction  is  at  arm's  length  as  per  the Comparable  Uncontrolled  Price  ('CUP')  method and in the normal course of business.\n\n## iii.

Receiving Corporate Services:\n\nAEL provides various support services to MEL like Information Technology, Central Treasury services, manpower support services etc. The costs to be charged to the Company will be on actual cost allocated on a reasonable basis. The key criteria for allocation of the costs for such support services is  based  on  the  strength  of  manpower  of  each company availing common services of IT, Admin and HR. In respect of common services relating to Finance and Treasury, the same is allocated based on the Debt & Capital employed. Payment to AEL will be made based on actual cost as allocated on reasonable basis, as explained above and no extra revenue is earned by AEL. The transaction in view of this is at arm's length and in the normal course of business.\n\n## Note 7: Availing Fly Ash Utilization / Disposal Services\n\nMinistry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has mandated that Thermal power plants are required to utilize / dispose 100% Ash generated and  prescribed  procedure  for  its  Enforcement, Monitoring, Audit and Reporting. The thermal power plant shall achieve average Ash utilization of 100 per cent in a three-to-five-year cycle as applicable. Noncompliant  thermal  power  plants  shall  be  imposed with an Environmental Compensation of Rs. 1000 per ton on unutilized Ash.\n\nTiroda TPP is expected to generate approx. 5 MMT of Fly Ash every year for which no assured long term commercial  customers  are  available.  Consistent Utilization of Fly Ash generated requires costs relating to new capex for infrastructure pertaining to storage, loading, transportation, silos, bagging, manpower, etc.\n\nTo  meet  the  aforesaid  statutory  obligation  of  Fly Ash utilization  with  full  certainty,  mitigate  the  risks associated  with  non-utilization  of  Fly  Ash  and  also to avoid any new CAPEX, the Company proposes to enter into a long term agreement for 10 years, which may be extended for a further period of 10 years with mutual consent, for Fly Ash utilization / disposal on 'As is Where Is basis' from its Tiroda TPP. Accordingly, the Company initiated competitive bidding process wherein  it  has  received  the  lowest  bid  of  Rs  380 per  ton  towards  cost  of  such  utilization  /  disposal of  Fly  Ash  from  DLT  LLP  for  the  said  services.  The utilization  /  disposal  cost  will  have  an  annual  price escalation linked to the Wholesale Price Index('WPI').\n\nIf required DLT LPP will also be directed to utilize the legacy Fly Ash at the same rate as derived above. The pricing of the transaction has been decided through a  competitive  bidding  process.  Hence,  the  said transaction is at arm's length and in the normal course of  business.  Though  the  transaction  value  is  not material as per the extant regulation but considering this being a long-term contract with a related party for good governance practice, the company seeks the approval of its shareholders.\n\nThe  Board  recommends  passing  of  the  Ordinary Resolutions as set out in Item nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Notice, for approval by the Members of the Company.\n\nAs  per  the  SEBI  Listing  Regulations,  all  related parties of the Company, whether or not a party to the proposed transaction(s), shall abstain from voting on the said resolution.\n\nMr. Gautam S. Adani and Mr. Rajesh S. Adani and their relatives are deemed to be concerned or interested in  these  resolutions.  None  of  other  the  Directors, Key Managerial Personnel of the Company and their respective  relatives,  are  in  any  way,  concerned  or interested,  financially  or  otherwise,  except  to  the extent of their shareholding in the Company, if any, in the proposed Ordinary Resolution, as set out in Item no. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Notice.\n\n## For Item No. 14\n\nThe  Board,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Audit Committee,  has  approved  the  appointment  and remuneration  of  M/s.

The  Transferor  Companies upon  such  amalgamation  stand  dissolved  without being wound up, without any further act or deed.\n\nIn  view  of  this,  in  order  to  cater  to  the  business requirements  for  consolidated  business  of  all  the seven companies, the Board at its meeting held on 5th May, 2023, has approved to increase the present borrowing limits from Rs. 45,000 Crore to Rs. 75,000 Crore under Section 180(1) (c) of the Companies Act, 2013 subject to approval of the shareholders.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section 180 (1) (a) of the Companies Act, 2013, the mortgage or charge on all or any part of the movable and/or immovable properties of the Company, may be deemed as the disposal of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the undertaking of the Company and hence, requires approval from the members of the Company by way of  a  Special  Resolution.  Therefore,  it  is  proposed to  pass  this  enabling  resolution  to  authorize  the Company  to  create  a  charge  or  mortgage  on  the assets or properties of the Company for an amount\n\nnot exceeding Rs. 75,000 Crore thereof, in excess of the aggregate of the paid-up capital of the Company and its free reserves.\n\nThe  Board  recommends  passing  of  the  Special Resolution as set out in Item no. 15 & 16 of this Notice, for approval by the Members of the Company.\n\nNone of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel of the Company and their respective relatives, are in any way, concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in the proposed Special Resolution, as set out in Item no. 15 & 16 of this Notice.\n\n## For Item No. 17:\n\nIn line with the regulatory changes in the recent past, the changes in the Companies Act and in line with various  directives  issued  by  Reserve  Bank  of  India, from time to time, the Company has been advised to  pass  a  Special  Resolution  under  Section  62(3) of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  and  other  applicable provisions  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  and  Rules made there-under to enable the Banks and Financial Institutions (hereinafter referred to as the 'Lenders') to  convert  the  outstanding  loans  or  any  other financial assistance categorized as loans (hereinafter referred  to  as  the  'Financial  Assistance'),  in  foreign currency or Indian Rupee, already availed from the Lenders or as may be availed from the Lenders, from time to time, at their option, into equity shares of the Company upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the Board and at a price to be determined in accordance with the applicable Securities and Exchange Board of India Regulations (SEBI Regulations) at the time of such conversion.\n\nThe Company had earlier passed requisite resolution under the said section, but due to proposed increase in the borrowing powers (as contemplated in Item no 15 & 16 of this Notice), it is desirable to enhance the limit of the threshold amount under this section also in line with the fresh borrowing limit envisaged from the shareholders of the Company under this Notice.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Board  recommends  the  resolution as  set  out  at  Item  No.  17,  to  enable  the  Lenders,  in terms  of  the  lending  arrangements,  entered/to  be entered,  and  as  may  be  specified  by  the  financial institutions/banks  under  the  financing  documents already executed or to be executed in respect of the financial  assistances  availed/to  be  availed,  at  their option, to convert the whole or part of their respective outstanding financial assistances into equity shares of the Company, upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the Board and at a price to be determined in accordance with the applicable SEBI Regulations at the time of such conversion.",
