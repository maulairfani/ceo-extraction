        "page_content": "In 2022, Standard Chartered continued to make good progress executing its strategy and delivered a strong financial performance. The external environment we faced was mixed. The war in Ukraine created significant uncertainty in Europe and other key markets. However, the global economy remained resilient, with the recent relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in China providing more grounds for optimism in 2023.\n\nAs these events unfold, it is clear that Standard Chartered's role - connecting high-growth and emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East with each other, and with Europe and the Americas - is more vital than ever. Our financial performance, and the resiliency of our unique geographic footprint, mean that we are well-positioned to capitalise on opportunities for growth in the years ahead.\n\nOur performance in 2022 is due in large part to the incredible work of our over 83,000 people across the world, supported by the Management Team, and led by Group Chief Executive Bill Winters. Every day, Standard Chartered colleagues deliver first-rate results for our clients, providing tailored products and services to help them grasp the opportunities ahead.\n\nAnchored in our Purpose, we continue to drive commerce and prosperity in markets across the world through our unique diversity. I am extremely proud of what we have achieved together in 2022, and I look forward to the opportunities that 2023 will bring.\n\n## Continued financial momentum\n\nWe continue to deliver an improving financial performance. Bill Winters, and Andy Halford, our Group Chief Financial Officer, will provide more detail on our financial results in the following pages.\n\nLast year, our income grew by 15 per cent to $16.3 billion, our highest since 2014, and underlying profit before tax increased by 15 per cent to $4.8 billion. It is clear that our strategy to drive improved levels of return on tangible equity (RoTE) is working. RoTE for the year increased to 8 per cent, 120 basis points higher year-on-year. We have revised our target RoTE for 2024 from 10 per cent to exceed 11 per cent, with further growth thereafter.\n\nThe Group maintained a robust liquidity position and our capital levels remain strong, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 14 per cent at year end, at the top of our target range of 13-14 per cent. Our asset quality and earnings trajectories are strong, which gives us confidence that we can deliver substantial shareholder returns of at least $5 billion by the end of 2024, as set out last year.\n\nThe Board is very clear that any capital not required for growth will be distributed to shareholders. We have increased the total dividend by 50 per cent to 18 cents per share and have announced a new share buy-back of $1 billion, starting imminently. This will take total capital, including dividends, announced since the start of 2022, to $2.8 billion, which is well over halfway towards our target.\n\n## Ambition and progress on our strategic priorities\n\nOur strategy, outlined in 2021, aligns us with the major engines of global growth and we see strong progress across our four strategic priorities: Network, Affluent, Mass Retail and Sustainability.\n\nOur Network business continues to facilitate investment, trade and capital flows across our geographic footprint, where we are one of the leading international wholesale banks. Our Affluent business is setting the standard for\n\nwealth management across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We are providing new digital solutions, strategic partnerships and advanced analytics to our Mass Retail clients, lifting participation and generating Affluent clients of the future. And we continue to focus on our Sustainability agenda that supports a just transition ensuring that we are making a difference where it matters most. The additional strategic actions we are targeting to accelerate our performance are outlined in Bill's report and I am pleased to say that we are executing against these at pace.\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by our Stands, the areas where we have set long-term ambitions for impact in the markets we call home: Accelerating Zero, Resetting Globalisation and Lifting Participation.\n\nThrough Accelerating Zero, we are progressing on our commitment to be net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, supporting a just transition - one where climate objectives are met without depriving emerging markets of their opportunity to grow and prosper - which will underpin future social and economic prosperity. Our 2050 Net Zero roadmap was endorsed by our shareholders at our 2022 Annual General Meeting, following extensive engagement with shareholders, clients and NGOs. During 2022 we facilitated $23.4 billion of sustainable finance, as we make progress towards our 2030 target of mobilising $300 billion in sustainable finance.\n\nThrough Resetting Globalisation we are leveraging our network and role as one of the world's largest trade banks, to create a fairer and more inclusive model of global growth, and building more resiliency in global supply chains through international diversification and digital technologies. We are also helping to address funding gaps for businesses across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, particularly for small and micro enterprises.\n\nThrough Lifting Participation, we continue to broaden access to financial services and create specialised programmes to support disadvantaged communities across our footprint. We remain hugely proud of our Futuremakers programme, which was set up in 2019 to improve economic inclusion in our markets, with a focus on women and girls, and in 2022 worked with over 335,000 young people. In India and Kenya, we have set up Solv, an e-commerce marketplace for small and medium-sized enterprises, which served over 230,000 customers in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, we worked in partnership with FairPrice Group to successfully launch the fully digital Trust Bank in Singapore, gaining 450,000 customers in our first five months.\n\nSC Ventures continues to invest in potentially transformational business models and ecosystems, connecting more and more clients with economic opportunity. This is just one example of our collaborative approach to innovation and financial inclusion.\n\n## Enhancing governance and culture\n\nDuring the year, we continued to drive diversity in our Board, recognising the benefits of a diverse mix of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, skills, knowledge, experience and adequate reflection of our key markets to support our strategy.\n\nThe Board was heartened by the results of the externally facilitated effectiveness review of the Board and its committees. It assessed the Board's progress since the last external review in 2019 and concluded that the Board continues to operate effectively while also identifying some areas for improvement.

Shirish Apte was appointed in May 2022 and joins the Remuneration, Audit and Board Risk Committees. Robin Lawther was appointed in July 2022 and joins the Remuneration and Board Risk Committees. Jackie Hunt was appointed in October 2022 and joins the Audit and Culture and Sustainability Committees. Dr. Linda Yueh was appointed in January 2023 and joins the Remuneration and Culture and Sustainability Committees. I am delighted to welcome them and I am sure that we will greatly benefit from their broad experience and contributions.\n\nLast year also saw the retirement of several long-standing and valued directors from our Board. I would like to thank Naguib Kheraj, former Deputy Chairman and Chair of the Board Risk Committee who retired from the Board in April for his unwavering dedication and most significant and impactful contributions to the Board and Committee discussions. My thanks also go to Byron Grote who retired from the Board in November for his many contributions to the Board and its Committees. In addition, I would like to thank Christine Hodgson, former Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, for her many insightful contributions and great dedication as well as for agreeing to remain on the Board until January 2023 to ensure a smooth transition to a new Remuneration Committee Chair.\n\nWe also announced that Jasmine Whitbread, Chair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee, and a long-standing and much valued board member, would not be seeking re-election at the 2023 AGM and will retire from the Board at that time.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe are well positioned to take advantage of considerable growth opportunities in our footprint as we navigate an uncertain external environment in 2023. Global growth, while slower, should remain resilient. But, with central banks focusing on controlling inflation against a backdrop of trade and geopolitical tensions, significant uncertainties remain.\n\nOur markets are some of the world's most dynamic places, with a growth potential that significantly outstrips more established economies. Asia is likely to be the fastest-growing region in the world, and the significant re-opening of the Chinese economy from COVID-19 restrictions is likely to materially boost demand and growth. This, together with India and ASEAN's high rates of economic expansion and continued dynamism in commodity-exporting countries in our footprint, gives us plenty of reasons for optimism as we continue to help customers build growth, prosperity and a stronger future.\n\nThe Board will continue to ensure an appropriate balance of opportunity and risk, acting in your interests as shareholders. We are grateful to you for the trust you place in us and for your ongoing support of the Group. I am confident that we will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for all stakeholders in 2023 and beyond.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman 16 February 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Group delivered a strong performance in 2022, executing well against our strategy and the five strategic actions we set out this time last year, whilst continuing to invest for the future. 2022 income was over $16 billion, our highest since 2014 and up 15 per cent, with about half coming from underlying business growth and the remainder from the normalisation in interest rates. This is particularly impressive given the material headwinds in our Wealth Management business. We have been disciplined with expenses, generating savings which allow for continued investment and significantly positive income-to-cost jaws. Loan impairment rose, mainly due to the challenges of the China commercial real estate sector and sovereign risk. The broader portfolio remains resilient and we continue to be vigilant in the face of volatile global markets. All this has helped us increase underlying profit before tax for the year to $4.8 billion, an improvement of 15 per cent year-on-year.\n\nOur strategy is working and delivering improved performance and returns to shareholders. Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) at 8 per cent is now above the levels it was before the pandemic. We intend to build on our momentum to approach 10 per cent RoTE in 2023, to over 11 per cent in 2024, and continue to grow thereafter. Our equity generation and discipline on RWA this year has meant our year end Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is at the top of our target range, allowing us to increase our full year ordinary dividend to 18 cents per share, a 50 per cent increase. We have also announced a further share buy-back of $1 billion, starting imminently, which will bring our total shareholder returns since the start of 2022 to $2.8 billion, well on our way to our 2024 target of at least $5 billion.\n\n## Good progress on our strategic actions\n\nWe are proud to connect the world's most dynamic markets. Our Purpose is to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity and this guides our strategy and everything we do. The businesses we serve, and with which we connect and partner, are the engines of trade and innovation, and central to the transition to a fair, sustainable future.\n\nIn support of our Purpose, we continue to focus on three 'Stands', areas where we have long-term ambitions for positive business and societal impact - Accelerating Zero, Resetting Globalisation and Lifting Participation. These stands are fully consistent with our strategy, stretching our thinking, our action and our leadership to accelerate our growth.\n\nWe set out our strategy in early 2021, built on the four pillars of Network, Affluent, Mass Retail and Sustainability. Two years on, these themes and areas of focus are even more relevant; our strategy is working, and will continue to drive\n\nCash investments\n\nNetwork income\n\nNumber of active Affluent Clients\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.1\n\nmillion\n\n7%\n\nfuture growth. In 2022 we also set out five strategic actions that we would take to accelerate delivery of double-digit RoTE, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Driving improved returns in Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking (CCIB)\n- \u00b7 Transforming profitability through productivity in Consumer Private & Business Banking (CPBB)\n- \u00b7 Seizing the opportunity in China with the ambition to double onshore and offshore profit before tax\n- \u00b7 Creating operational leverage and delivering gross cost savings of $1.3 billion\n- \u00b7 Delivering over $5 billion of capital returns to our shareholders\n\nWe have made good progress across all five areas.\n\nIn CCIB we are targeting around a 160 basis point improvement in income return on risk weighted assets (IRORWA) to 650 basis points with RWA capped at full year 2021 levels. We have already delivered on this IRORWA improvement target in 2022 and RWA levels are $20 billion below 2021 levels. The recently announced strategic review of our Aviation Finance business will create further capacity for CCIB to grow higher return business.\n\nIn CPBB the team has already achieved gross savings of $233 million against their 2024 target of $500 million. These savings have come from rationalising the branch network, process re-engineering, headcount efficiencies and further automation. Despite a challenging Wealth Management performance in 2022 the CPBB cost-to-income ratio improved 5 percentage points to 69 per cent and should show further improvement in 2023.\n\nChina has faced COVID-19 and economic headwinds. Despite those difficulties, our onshore China business increased its income by 10 per cent in 2022, and offshorerelated income is up 21 per cent. However, impairments on China commercial real estate related risk have pushed our offshore and onshore China operating profit down in 2022. We are confident in the long-term opportunity in China and committed to achieving our 2024 targets for Chinarelated growth.\n\nThe Group's positive income-to-cost jaws of 6 per cent in 2022 were driven by strong income growth and discipline on expenses. We have delivered about a third of the $1.3 billion expense save target we set out earlier this year. Inflationary pressures are now evident in many of our footprint markets and these expense saves help us manage those pressures, whilst creating capacity to invest. We will now target positive income-to-cost jaws of around 3 per cent in 2023 and 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review\n\ncontinued\n\n## Further opportunities emerging\n\nIn 2022 we continued to transform and innovate within our business to drive sustainable growth, including developing our digital and sustainability capabilities. Our colleagues bring unrivalled financial expertise to help identify opportunities across growing markets, sectors and in sustainable finance. We continue to prove ourselves as a trusted partner, working with start-ups, multinationals, fintechs and governments to create new ideas, technology and innovation.\n\nIn our Ventures segment, we were delighted to announce the launch of our second wholly digital bank, Trust Bank, in Singapore. Partnering with FairPrice Group, the largest supermarket chain in Singapore, and building on our successful experience of creating the Mox virtual bank in Hong Kong, we were able to bring Trust Bank to the market quickly and efficiently. The early success of Trust Bank, onboarding over 450,000 customers so far, or 9 per cent of the addressable market, has exceeded our most ambitious expectations. In 2023, Trust Bank will build on this momentum to roll out additional products to better serve our customers. Together with Mox, we now have fully developed virtual and traditional bank offerings in two of our most significant markets.\n\nThe sustainability agenda continues to gather pace as the world faces significant climate and environmental challenges, with the imperative to invest, find solutions and support a just transition to net zero having never been greater. In 2022 we reshaped our organisation to better address the challenges and opportunities, creating a Chief Sustainability Officer role as we continue to invest in the capabilities and expertise that our business and clients need.\n\nAt the 2022 Annual General Meeting, our 2050 Net Zero pathway was endorsed by our shareholders, and we are on track to deliver on our plans to reach net zero in our operations by 2025 and in our financed emissions by 2050. We  have made good progress during the year and we have accelerated progress in some areas where more market data on emissions has become available.\n\nWe have a deep understanding of how climate change affects our footprint markets, clients and communities and we continue to play a leading role in addressing these challenges. The estimates of the financing needed to deliver net zero continues to grow and we mobilised $48 billion of sustainable finance in the last 21 months as we support our clients on their transition plans. Our ambition is to mobilise $300 billion in sustainable finance by 2030 and we have developed a Green and Sustainable Product Framework and Transition Finance Framework to guide us.\n\n## Optimistic outlook for the markets in our footprint\n\nLooking forward into 2023, whilst there is recession risk in the US and Europe, ongoing geopolitical issues and the war in Ukraine, we also see reasons for increased optimism for the areas of the world in which we operate.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is now finally abating in the last few markets in our footprint. China's new approach to dealing with COVID-19 will drive economic growth and this in turn will help further improve GDP growth in the economies of Asia.\n\nThis will also act as a catalyst for our Wealth Management business which was subdued in 2022. Clients remained on the side-lines as market volatility undermined confidence. This together with the last remaining pandemic restrictions led to a year-on-year fall in income. As we go into 2023, we are optimistic that as these factors recede the Wealth Management business can rebound from a difficult year.\n\nRising interest rates will inevitably feed through further into loan impairment at some stage. However, reflecting the work we have done over a number of years to reshape our loan portfolios, there are only relatively small pockets of stress in our books. Our loan loss rate remains well below the historic range. Whilst China commercial real estate exposures remain a challenge for the banking sector generally, it remains a small part of our portfolio, against which we feel appropriately provided. We remain watchful on sovereign risk where continued USD strength will remain problematic for some of our markets though we have the capital strength to navigate these challenges.\n\nFinally, reflecting our increased optimism, we are lifting our earnings targets. We had said that we will deliver double digit RoTE in 2024, if not earlier. As we start the new year we think we will be approaching 10 per cent RoTE in 2023 and have raised our 2024 RoTE target to be at least 11 per cent and to continue to grow thereafter.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nThe Group has delivered a strong performance in 2022. The revenue outlook into 2023 is positive, with our core business momentum supported by the tailwind of rising interest rates.\n\nWe are optimistic for the markets in our footprint as they finally emerge from the challenges brought by the pandemic and as economic activity rebounds. Our strategy is clear, we continue to make good progress on our five targeted strategic actions and remain committed to delivering over $5 billion of shareholder returns by 2024.\n\nFinally, echoing Jos\u00e9, I would like to highlight the remarkable efforts of our more than 83,000 colleagues. Their deep expertise combined with resilience in some challenging circumstances in certain markets has delivered seamless service to our customers and communities that we serve, bringing to life our brand promise to be here for good.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBill Winters\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n16 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Market environment\n\n## Macroeconomic factors affecting the global landscape\n\n## Global macro trends\n\n## Trends in 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Global GDP growth slowed sharply in 2022, likely to 3.4 per cent, following the 6.0 per cent expansion in 2021, as inflation soared and central banks were forced to tighten policy aggressively.\n\n## Outlook for 2023\n\n## Mediumand longterm view\n\n- \u00b7 MENAP was the best-performing region, recording growth of 6.2 per cent, supported by elevated commodity prices; Asia recorded growth of 4.2 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent in 2021, primarily driven by the slowdown in China, with growth falling to 3.0 per cent in 2022 from 8.4 per cent in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Among the majors, despite a technical recession in the first half of the year, the United States recorded annual growth of 2.1 per cent on the back of resilient domestic demand, while the UK likely grew by 4.0 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Global growth is expected to weaken to 2.5 per cent in 2023, as central banks focus on bringing inflation back under control.\n- \u00b7 Asia will likely be the fastest-growing region and will continue to drive global growth, expanding by 5.3 per cent. Among the majors, the United States is expected to witness a mild contraction of 0.2 per cent in 2023, the UK a larger contraction of 0.5 per cent, while the euro area is likely to see an overall modest expansion of 0.4 per cent.\n\n## Stagflation risks\n\n- \u00b7 Tight labour markets and the broadening of inflationary pressures to the services sector are likely to keep stagflation a key concern for central banks over the coming quarters.\n- \u00b7 The need to meet ESG targets could also prove inflationary in the medium term as the cost of using fossil fuels during the transition period rises due to a combination of taxes, carbon pricing and external tariffs.\n- \u00b7 As companies aim to reduce concentration risks and move towards onshore/nearshore production, the risk is a lowering of efficiency gains that might push up consumer prices.\n- \u00b7 However, easing of supply-chain bottlenecks is likely to help dampen some of these pressures.\n- \u00b7 Fiscal policy might also turn from a tailwind to a headwind for growth. High public debt and government deficits also mean that most economies are looking to tighten fiscal policy over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 The euro-area economy likely grew by 3.5 per cent in 2022 following 5.3 per cent growth in 2021; while the recovery was strong in H1 due to COVID-19 reopening effects, H2 was held back by rising energy costs related to the RussiaUkraine conflict.\n- \u00b7 In most majors, labour markets showed signs of further tightening, despite slowing growth.\n- \u00b7 Central banks began to unwind support, at first gradually and then more rapidly as the year progressed and inflationary pressures built. Fiscal support continued in the euro area as governments sought to shield households and businesses from elevated energy costs, but provided less of a tailwind in the United States as COVID-19 support measures were unwound.\n- \u00b7 2023 will be a tale of two halves, with global growth likely to pick up in H2 2023 as the United States and euro area recover from mild recessions, and a reopening of the China economy from COVID-19 restrictions helps boost demand and growth.\n- \u00b7 Tight global liquidity conditions are likely to make it difficult for some emerging markets to access international financing, forcing them to seek multilateral support.\n- \u00b7 Downside risks to this outlook include sustained inflationary pressures, COVID-19 mutations following China's quick reopening, and another flare-up of geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n## Broader global trends\n\n- \u00b7 The world economy could see a permanent loss of economic output or 'scarring' due to the recession that followed the pandemic. This would make it harder for emerging markets to catch up with developed markets.\n- \u00b7 Long-term growth in the developed world is constrained by ageing populations and high levels of debt, exacerbated by the policy response to COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Rising nationalism, anti-globalisation and protectionism are threats to long-term growth prospects in emerging markets.\n- \u00b7 However, there are potential offsets. Higher capex to meet sustainability targets, and moves towards digitalisation could boost productivity growth, proving an antidote to economic scarring concerns. Within emerging markets, countries in Asia are best placed to take advantage of digitalisation.\n- \u00b7 Relatively younger populations, as well as the adoption of digital technology, will allow emerging markets to become increasingly important to global growth.",

        "page_content": "## Asia\n\n- \u00b7 China's GDP growth slowed to 3.0 per cent in 2022 from 8.4 per cent in 2021, falling short of the 5.5 per cent target. Weak consumption and property investment were the main drag on the economy, due to the stringent zero-COVID-19 policy and ongoing housing market correction. We forecast 2023 growth at 5.8 per cent, as the government appears more determined after the conclusion of the Party Congress in October to address the two headwinds. China scrapped the COVID-19 zero policy sooner than expected. Recent measures aimed at supporting property financing will likely stabilise home sales and investment in H2 2023. In addition, the regulatory storm targeting internet platforms will likely give way to more normalised regulation. Consumption is likely to become a key growth driver, and property investment less of a drag.\n- \u00b7 Monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative near term, diverging from major economies, to curb the downside risk that may linger in early 2023. However, China's growth will likely rebound significantly in Q2 following the expected reopening, driving inflation higher and prompting the central bank to shift to a more neutral policy stance to stabilise the total debt-to-GDP ratio. The broad budget deficit is likely to be scaled back in 2023 on sustainability concerns.\n- \u00b7 We expect Hong Kong's economy to grow 3.2 per cent in 2023 following a 3.5 per cent contraction in 2022. While there are some domestic bright spots, including a much-improved labour market and relaxation of travel curbs, external drags will likely be substantial, with traditional export markets such as the United States and euro area experiencing recession at the start of 2023. We expect South Korea's economy to grow just 1.7 per cent on concerns about weaker external demand and slowing domestic consumption amid rising interest rates and tighter fiscal policy.\n- \u00b7 In India, recovery momentum remains robust, driven by firmer reopening in the services sector. Nevertheless, we expect FY24 (year beginning April 2023) GDP growth to moderate to 5.5 per cent, from 7.0 per cent in the current financial year, given moderating global growth, erosion of real purchasing power and high domestic interest rates. Easing inflation back to the comfort threshold of 2-6 per cent in FY24 should also lead to a prolonged pause from the MPC after the terminal repo rate hits 6.5 per cent by February 2023. The external sector will remain in focus amid the likelihood of still-elevated crude oil prices and relatively better economic activity in India. Ample foreign exchange (FX) reserves, however, are likely to remain a strong buffer for the economy. The central bank is likely to focus on rebuilding FX reserves, although this might remain challenging amid a still-wide current account deficit. The central government budget presentation in February 2023 will be closely watched for any growth-supportive measures ahead of national elections in mid-2024. We believe the government will stay focused on narrowing the fiscal deficit, which is already significantly wider relative to the pre-pandemic phase.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actual and projected growth by market in 2022 and 2023 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| China     |   2023 | 5.8 %   |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n|           |   2022 | 3.0 %   |\n| Hong Kong |   2023 | 3.2 %   |\n|           |   2022 | (3.5) % |\n| Korea     |   2023 | 1.7 %   |\n|           |   2022 | 2.7 %   |\n| India     |   2023 | 5.5 %   |\n|           |   2022 | 7. 0 %  |\n| Indonesia |   2023 | 5.1 %   |\n|           |   2022 | 5.4 %   |\n| Singapore |   2023 | 2.0 %   |\n|           |   2022 | 3.6 %   |\n\n- \u00b7 Singapore and Indonesia are likely to see softer growth in 2023 compared to 2022, and ASEAN growth is set to ease to its long-term average of 5.0 per cent in 2023. As well as high base effects, external demand for ASEAN exports may soften due to global synchronised monetary policy tightening and the electronic cycle peak. Domestic demand may ease as COVID-19 induced pent-up demand normalises, while local monetary policy tightening may rein in overall consumer and investment impetus. However, stable labour markets will help support spending. The recovery in the tourism sector, which is a large growth contributor for the region, will also help drive growth. In addition, investments may be boosted by FDI seeking diversification and alternative production capacity.\n- \u00b7 We expect inflation to be milder in 2023 due to high base effects. External prices may be more manageable, while tighter monetary policy should help. While monetary policy tightening may pause by early 2023, any easing might not be forthcoming amid potentially sticky inflation, unless growth deteriorates significantly.",

Notwithstanding global trends, rising food and fuel prices are still pressuring domestic inflation, with transmission often exacerbated by FX weakness. The impact of 2022's monetary policy tightening will be felt with a lag, with a number of central banks still expected to raise interest rates further.\n- \u00b7 In Nigeria, presidential and general elections in February/March 2023 will be a key focus, with the likelihood of FX and fuel subsidy reforms potentially establishing conditions for more robust medium-term investment and growth. While load-shedding will dampen near-term growth prospects in South Africa, a faster embrace of renewables and increased corporatisation of South Africa's rail and port infrastructure, could unlock a greater private sector contribution to growth. In Kenya, efforts to boost lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the increased adoption of digital channels for financial intermediation, should help lift loan growth.\n- \u00b7 Across the Sub-Saharan Africa space, monetary tightening will drive healthier net interest margins. However, international capital market access is likely to remain constrained for a number of sovereigns, raising doubts over the easy refinancing of external debt obligations. The timely conclusion of debt restructuring in Zambia and Ghana could help boost investor sentiment. A pause in Fed tightening, may help to reduce investor demand for higher-risk premia.\n- \u00b7 A supportive energy price environment will likely provide continued benefit to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) growth. The focus is once again on the region as a provider of capital, as Gulf economies proceed with longer-term economic diversification plans, seek to reduce the traditional procyclicality of spending, and invest strategically in green technology. In the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, we expect the continuation of robust growth, driven by strong investment across both the hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon sectors. For smaller GCC economies such as Oman, higher oil prices will drive a reduction in accumulated debt levels. For the non-GCC MENAP region, conditions remain challenging. Pakistan's ability to reassure on its external debt commitments, amid dwindling FX reserves, will remain a key focus. In Egypt, recent currency depreciation and a more accommodative risk backdrop globally could see the return of the carry trade. But economic conditions remain difficult amid higher inflation, and the authorities' commitment to FX flexibility will be closely monitored.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our regional performance on page 30\n\n## Europe and the Americas\n\nActual and projected growth by market in 2022 and 2023 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 We see a high risk of contraction in the United States in H1 2023; in the euro area, we expect annual growth to decline sharply in 2023 as high inflation and central bank tightening weigh on economic activity.\n- \u00b7 The peak for consumer price inflation is likely behind us for both the United States and euro area, but will take time to return to target. Central banks will remain alert to any signs of inflation expectations becoming unanchored or wage pressures building over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 The Fed is likely to end its rate tightening cycle in H1 2023, and we expect rate-cuts to begin in H2 2023. The ECB is likely to hike its main refinancing rate until Q2 2023, but not start cutting rates until 2024 as inflation proves sticky on the downside.\n- \u00b7 Fiscal support is likely to remain focused on supporting households and businesses struggling with elevated energy costs in Europe, but otherwise we can expect the tailwind from fiscal support to ease in both the euro area and United States.\n- \u00b7 In Latin America, we expect a significant growth slowdown in 2023 following a strong 2022. The delayed impact of aggressive monetary tightening and other idiosyncratic issues are likely to weigh on domestic demand; external headwinds and looming recession risks in the United States are likely to drag down the region's growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our regional performance on page 31",

This works in unison with our strategy, stretching our thinking, our action and our leadership to accelerate our growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lifting Participation\n\n## Resetting Globalisation\n\nInequality, along with gaps in economic inclusion, mean that many young people, women and small businesses struggle to gain access to the financial system to save for their futures and grow their businesses. We want to democratise access to finance and make it easily accessible at low cost.\n\nWe strive to expand the reach and scale of financial services - expanding accessible banking and connecting clients to opportunities that promote access to finance and economic inclusion.\n\nCase study\n\nHelping female entrepreneurs thrive\n\nThroughout 2022, thousands of women were able to grow their businesses by using our collateral-free subsidised loans product for female micro-entrepreneurs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 9\n\n## Accelerating Zero\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe're helping emerging markets in our footprint reduce carbon emissions without slowing critical local development. This is just one of the ways we're playing our part in putting the world on a sustainable path to net zero by 2050.\n\nThe need for a just transition to an inclusive, net zero economy brings with it a huge opportunity for innovation and growth for our clients and our Bank. Our plan to achieve net zero has three aims: reduce emissions, catalyse sustainable finance and partnerships, and accelerate new solutions.\n\nWe aim to reduce the emissions associated with our financing activities to net zero by 2050, with 2030 interim targets in our most carbon-intensive sectors.\n\nCase study\n\nSupporting the rollout of electric vehicles in Sweden\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur goal is to help companies improve working and environmental standards and give everyone the chance to participate in the world economy, so growth becomes fairer and more balanced. We stand for a new model of globalisation based on transparency, inclusion and dialogue.\n\nGlobalisation has lifted millions out of poverty, but too many people have been left behind. We advocate a new, more inclusive model of globalisation based on transparency and fairness. We aim to increase transparency across supply chains to enable consumer choice and drive responsible trade. In addition, we want to make global trade more equitable by improving access to finance for smaller suppliers that often lack adequate financing.\n\nCase study\n\nReal-time trade transaction status with Trade Track-It\n\nIn October, we launched Trade Track-It, a digital transaction tracking portal which gives our clients end-to-end visibility of their trade-transaction status globally.\n\nSee pages 232 and 233\n\nIn 2022, we were part of a consortium of banks which created a EUR350 million green trade facility for Polestar, an electric performance car maker.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 326 and 327",

Ventures is a consolidation of SC Ventures and its related entities as well as the Group's two majorityowned digital banks, Mox in Hong Kong and Trust Bank in Singapore.\n\n- \u00b7 SC Ventures is the platform and catalyst for the Group to promote innovation, invest in disruptive financial technology and explore alternative business models.\n- \u00b7 Mox, a cloud-native, mobile-only digital bank, was launched in Hong Kong as a joint venture with HKT, PCCW and Ctrip in September 2020.\n- \u00b7 Trust Bank was launched in Singapore in partnership with FairPrice Group, the nation's leading grocery retailer, in September 2022.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\n- \u00b7 SC Ventures' focus is on building and scaling new business models - across the four themes of Online Economy & Lifestyle, SMEs & World Trade, Digital Assets and Sustainability & Inclusion. We do this by connecting ecosystems, partners and clients to create value and new sources of revenue, providing optionality for the Bank. SC Ventures is also advancing the Fintech agenda - identifying, partnering and taking minority interests through the fund in companies that provide technology capabilities, which can be integrated into the Bank and Ventures. Focus is on innovative, fast-growing, technology-focused companies which accelerate transformation in the financial industry.\n- \u00b7 Mox continues to grow the customer base and drive main bank relationships across mass and mass affluent segments in Hong Kong. Mox's vision is to build the global benchmark for digital banking. It aims to be the leading virtual bank in Hong Kong for Cards and Digital Lending and continues to further expand services, including the soon-to-launch Digital Wealth Management services.\n- \u00b7 Trust Bank is targeting continued strong growth, in particular through its deep and extensive partner ecosystem, and to establish itself as a scale player in the mass and upper mass consumer segment in Singapore.\n\n## Progress\n\n- \u00b7 SC Ventures marks its fifth year anniversary in 2023. Some of the key achievements include building a diverse portfolio of over 30 ventures and 20+ investments. Our ventures processed $16 billion of transactions in 2022 with a customer base of 1 million. By working with strategic partners like SBI Holdings, we will accelerate the growth of Solv, the B2B digital marketplace for micro, small and medium enterprises and connect with a wider ecosystem across multiple markets. Our Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorised, institutional grade crypto businesses, Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets, commenced onboarding clients during the year.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Mox had a strong focus on expanding its card and digital lending services and recorded a strong performance and an engaged customer base. Mox has more than 400,000 customers, up two times year-on-year, and Mox customers had on average 3.1x products. Mox was named as the most recommended virtual bank in Hong Kong and continued to be the number one rated virtual bank app in Hong Kong on the Apple App Store.\n- \u00b7 Within five months of launch, Trust Bank scaled rapidly to over 450,000 customers, equating to around 9 per cent of the addressable market in Singapore, and making it one of the world's fastest growing digital banks. Customer engagement was strong, with almost 7 million transactions made, and more than 400,000 digital coupons redeemed through the app during this period.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying loss before tax of $363 million was up $102 million, driven mainly by higher expenses as we continue to invest in new and existing ventures.\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets of $1.4 billion have increased $0.6 billion mainly due to continued investment in new and existing ventures and minority interests.",

The region generates over two-thirds of the Group's income from its extensive network of 21 markets. Of these, Hong Kong and Singapore contributed the highest income, underpinned by a diversified franchise and deeply rooted presence.\n\nThe region is highly interconnected, with three distinct and potent sub-regions: Greater China, ASEAN and South Asia. Our global footprint and strong regional presence, distinctive proposition, and continued investment position us strongly to capture opportunities as they arise from the continuing opening up of China's economy, the growing connectivity of ASEAN, and the strong economic growth of India.\n\nThe region is benefiting from rising trade flows, continued strong investment, and a rising middle class, which is driving consumption growth and improving digital connectivity.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Leverage our network strength to serve the inbound and outbound cross-border trade and investment needs of our clients, particularly across high-growth corridors e.g., China-ASEAN, China-South Asia, Korea-ASEAN\n- \u00b7 Capture opportunities arising from China's opening, and accelerate growth in ASEAN and India/South Asia.\n- \u00b7 Turbocharge our Affluent and Wealth Management businesses through differentiated propositions and service.\n\n## [[ Planting trees in Sri Lanka and Malaysia]]\n\nOur employees planted more than 1,000 trees in Sri Lanka and Malaysia in 2022.

In 2022 the China business delivered its highest ever onshore income while also growing network income strongly, with the China-ASEAN and China-South Asia corridors being respectively up 62 per cent and 21 percent year-on-year.  Progress was made in the digital retail space with new partnerships involving JD.com and WeBank.\n- \u00b7 Our two strong international financial hubs in Hong Kong and Singapore, which enable us to serve the three sub-engines of economic growth in Asia, continued to be the highest income contributors in the region.  Income growth was driven by the Affluent segment and Transaction Banking, helped in part by rising interest rates, and also by Financial Markets.\n- \u00b7 Execution of our strategy in the Greater Bay Area ('GBA') continues to be on track with the establishment of a solid cross border wealth management platform and strong growth in new economy sectors and in network business.\n- \u00b7 The CPBB digital agenda continues to progress.  Mox has the second largest deposit base among virtual banks in Hong Kong while Trust Bank, in partnership with Fairprice Group in Singapore, has onboarded more than 450,000 customers after five months of its launch.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying profit before tax of $3,688 million was up 8 per cent, primarily from higher income partly offset by higher credit impairment from charges on China Commercial Real Estate exposures and the sovereign ratings downgrade of Sri Lanka.\n- \u00b7 Underlying operating income of $11,213 million was up 7 per cent (up 12 per cent on a constant currency), mainly driven by a strong Financial Markets performance and an expansion in the net interest margin benefiting Cash Management and Retail Deposits. This was partially offset by lower Lending and Wealth Management income as market conditions reduced transaction volumes, as well as the impact of COVID-19 restrictions impacting in our key markets, Hong Kong and China.\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances to customers were up 2 per cent (up 6 per cent on a constant currency), Customer accounts were down 3 per cent (flat on a constant currency) since 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets (RWA) were down $19 billion since 31 December 2021 as we continue to focus on RWA optimisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Summary of financial performance\n\nThe Group delivered a strong performance in 2022 generating a 120 basis point uplift in underlying return on tangible equity to 8.0 per cent with underlying profit before tax increasing 15 per cent on a constant currency basis. Income at $16.3 billion, grew 15 per cent on a constant currency basis excluding DVA, and is at its highest level since 2014, with a record performance in Financial Markets and strong expansion in the net interest margin. Loans and advances to customers grew an underlying 3 per cent despite the rising interest rate environment. Expenses increased 9 per cent at constant currency, due to continued investment in the business, salary inflation, and increased performance-related pay on the back of business performance. Credit impairment charges increased to $838 million including further charges relating to the China commercial real estate sector and the impact of sovereign-related downgrades. However, the loan-loss rate of 21 basis points remains well below our historic through-the-cycle loan loss range. The Group remains well capitalised and highly liquid with a CET1 ratio of 14.0 per cent at the top end of its target range enabling the Board to announce a 50 per cent increase in the full-year dividend and a further $1 billion share buy-back programme to start imminently.\n\nAll commentary that follows is on an underlying basis and comparisons are made to the equivalent period in 2021 on a reported currency basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income increased 10 per cent, or 15 per cent on a constant currency basis, normalising for a $27 million positive movement in DVA. About half of the growth in income was from strong, sustained business momentum, through a combination of balance sheet growth and increased fee and trading income, with the remaining increase reflecting the benefit of a higher interest rate environment\n- \u00b7 Net interest income increased 12 per cent or 18 per cent on a constant currency basis. The net interest margin averaged 141 basis points and is 20 basis points higher year-on-year aided by rising interest rates despite a 4-basis point negative impact from short-term and structural hedges\n- \u00b7 Other income increased 9 per cent, with a record performance in Financial Markets partly offset by lower Wealth Management income impacted by subdued market conditions\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses excluding the UK bank levy increased 4 per cent and were up 7 per cent on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the increase in performancerelated pay driven by the strong business performance. The underlying expense growth reflects the impact of a high-inflation environment including the impact on salary increases, additional investment into transformational digital capabilities and headcount. The cost-to-income ratio decreased 4 percentage points to 66 per cent excluding DVA and UK bank levy and the Group generated 6 per cent positive income-to-cost jaws at constant currency excluding DVA\n- \u00b7 Credit impairment was $838 million, an increase of $575 million. The impairment charge includes $582 million in relation to China commercial real estate sector and $283 million in relation to sovereign downgrades partly offset by releases in the management overlay relating to COVID-19. Total credit impairment of $838 million represents a loan-loss rate of 21 basis points, a year-on-year increase of 14 basis points in the cost of risk, but still well below the historic through-the-cycle loan loss range of 30 to 35 basis points.\n- \u00b7 Other impairment increased by $24 million to $79 million. The $300 million impairment charge recorded in 2021 relating to the Group's investment in its associate China Bohai Bank (Bohai) has been reclassified out of underlying performance and into goodwill and other impairments. The remaining other impairment primarily relates to the aviation leasing portfolio\n- \u00b7 Profit from associates and joint ventures decreased 5 per cent to $167 million reflecting a lower profit share from Bohai\n- \u00b7 Charges relating to restructuring, other items and goodwill and other impairment reduced by $373 million to $476 million, with $333 million lower restructuring costs, principally a non-repeat of the prior-year retirement programme in Korea. Goodwill and other impairment of $322 million is $22 million higher year-on-year following a $14 million write off of the goodwill relating to Bangladesh. Furthermore, there has been a $308 million impairment relating to Bohai, primarily a result of industry challenges and uncertainties that may impact profitability.\n- \u00b7 Taxation was $1,384 million on a statutory basis, with a statutory effective tax rate of 32 per cent. Taxation on underlying profits was at an effective rate of 30 per cent, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2021 primarily driven by lower prior year credits and higher taxes in UK, Pakistan and US.\n- \u00b7 Underlying return on tangible equity increased 120 basis points to 8.0 per cent due to the increase in profits and lower tangible equity, reflecting shareholder distributions and adverse movements in reserves due to movements in interest rates and currency translation. The reclassification of the 2021 Bohai impariment out from underlying performance increased the 2021 underlying return on tangible equity by 80 basis points to 6.8 per cent and has made the treatment of Bohai impairment consistent across both the 2021 and 2022 computation of underlying return on tangible equity\n- \u00b7 Underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) increased 18 per cent to 101.1 cents and statutory EPS of 85.9 cents increased by 40 per cent\n- \u00b7 A final ordinary dividend per share of 14 cents has been proposed taking the full-year total to 18 cents, a 50 per cent increase along with a new share buy-back programme of $1 billion, taking total shareholder distributions announced since the start of 2022 to $2.8 billion",

Cash Management income increased 85 per cent reflecting strong pricing discipline to take advantage of a rising interest rate environment. Trade & Working Capital decreased 1 per cent, with balance sheet growth offset by margin compression. The margin compression reflects a shift towards investment credit grade clients and a shift in product mix towards lower margin but more RWA-efficient products.\n\nFinancial Markets income increased 21 per cent and was a record performance. Macro trading increased 40 per cent with FX income delivering strong double-digit growth as macro events led to increased client demand and elevated volatility, widening bid-offer spreads. Commodities also delivered strong double-digit growth, including a record first quarter, when it benefited from volatility in energy prices, while Rates also provided strong double-digit increase in income on the back of policy rates increases. Credit Markets income decreased 3 per cent driven by subdued market conditions in spite of a strong performance in Credit Trading. Structured Finance declined 17 per cent with lower fee income within Aviation Finance. Financing & Securities Services income increased 67 per cent, including $184 million of gains on mark-to-market liabilities and benefiting from improved margins in Securities Services.\n\nLending and Portfolio Management income decreased 22 per cent due to increased cost of funds and the impact of risk-weighted asset optimisation actions.\n\nWealth Management income declined 17 per cent as customer sentiment became more risk-averse in volatile market conditions leading to lower transaction volumes. There was a negative impact from COVID-19 restrictions, in particular in North Asia, resulting in a number of branch closures and lower footfall which negatively impacted face-to-face sales. Managed Investments income was down 39 per cent, there was a 6 per cent decline in Treasury Products income while Bancassurance income declined 6 per cent. Wealth Management secured lending income fell by a third on the back of client deleveraging. Net new sales remained positive albeit at a lower level than 2021 but assets under management volumes reduced on the back of negative market movements.\n\nRetail Products income increased 29 per cent. Deposit income increased 157 per cent due to active passthrough rate management in a rising interest rate environment, partly offset by migration from CASA to time deposits. Mortgages & Auto income decreased 35 per cent reflecting margin compression with the majority of mortgages in Hong Kong reaching the Best Lending Rate cap. Credit Cards & Personal Loans income increased 1 per cent reflecting a growth in credit card balances, particularly in our digital banks Mox and Trust Bank.\n\nTreasury income declined 47 per cent, reflecting the losses from structural and short-term hedges in a rising interest rate environment which offset increased yields on the remainder of the Treasury portfolio.",

Ventures is a consolidation of SC Ventures and its related entities as well as the Group's two majority-owned digital banks Mox in Hong Kong and Trust Bank in Singapore, reported alongside the current client segments; Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking (CCIB) serving larger companies and institutions and Consumer, Private & Business Banking (CPBB) serving individual and business banking clients. There was no change to the regional reporting structure.\n\nCorporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking profit increased 31 per cent as robust Financial Markets and Cash Management performance drove 19 per cent income growth excluding positive movements in DVA. This was partly offset by a 4 per cent increase in expenses and a $469 million increase in impairments reflecting further charges in relation to the China commercial real estate sector and lower releases on the remaining portfolio.\n\nConsumer, Private & Business Banking profit increased 30 per cent and was 35 per cent higher on a constant currency basis. Income grew 10 per cent on a constant currency basis with increased Deposit income partly offset by subdued Wealth Management and the impact of the Best Lending Rate cap on Hong Kong mortgage income. On a constant currency basis, expenses grew 3 per cent and impairments decreased $10 million.\n\nVentures loss increased to $363 million. Income totalled $29 million for the year, with an increasing customer base at Mox and Trust Bank. Expenses increased by a third reflecting further investment into the segment and increased operational costs to support the significant increase in customer onboarding and transactional volumes within the new digital banks. Other impairment of $24 million was taken in relation to the value of one of the Group's investments within the Ventures portfolio.\n\nCentral & other items (segment) recorded a loss of $571 million as income declined 71 per cent reflecting the losses from structural and short-term hedges booked within Treasury. Expenses increased 26 per cent while credit impairments were $112 million higher as a result of the ratings downgrades of select sovereigns.\n\nAsia profits increased 8 per cent on the back of a 7 per cent increase in income. This was partly offset by 1 per cent expense growth and an 82 per cent increase in impairments reflecting increased charges relating to the China commercial real estate sector.\n\nAfrica & Middle East profits decreased 4 per cent but grew 4 per cent on a constant currency basis. Income increased 14 per cent while expenses grew 9 per cent, both on a constant currency basis. Impairments went from a net release in the prior year to a $118 million charge, partly due to the sovereign ratings downgrades of Pakistan and Ghana.\n\nEurope & Americas profit increased by a third with a 17 per cent increase in income on the back of a strong Financial Markets and Cash Management performance. Expenses increased 5 per cent while the net release in credit impairment halved to $77 million.\n\nCentral & other items (region) loss decreased by $112 million to $608 million due to a 30 per cent increase in expenses. Income increased 145 per cent, while impairments reduced by 16 per cent",

        "page_content": "Asset quality remains stable, despite a year-on-year increase in the impairment charge, with an improvement in a number of underlying credit metrics. However, the Group continues to remain alert to an unpredictable and challenging external environment including pressures in the China commercial real estate sector, commodity price volatility and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war. This war in part contributed to both commodity price volatility and the accelerated trajectory of inflation and interest rate rises across our footprint, which in turn have contributed to both an increased risk of global recession and the appreciation of the US dollar versus the majority of developed and emerging market currencies. These factors have contributed to increased sovereign credit stress in a handful of our markets which we continue to monitor closely and undertake mitigating actions where appropriate.\n\nCredit impairment totalled $838 million, an increase of $575 million, representing a loan loss rate of 21 basis points, still some way below the historic loan loss rate range. Impairment charges relating to the China commercial real estate sector totalled $582 million in the year, including a $78 million increase in the management overlay relating to the China commercial real estate sector, which now totals $173 million. Sri Lanka and Ghana had their sovereign ratings downgraded into stage 3 , while Pakistan sovereign ratings were downgraded into credit grade 12. These sovereign ratings downgrades incurred a $283 million impairment charge in the year. The CPBB normalised run-rate charge increased by 9 per cent while recoveries in CCIB declined by a third. The above were partly offset by a $228 million decrease in the COVID-19 related management overlay, which now totals $21 million.\n\nGross stage 3 loans and advances to customers of $7.8 billion were 3 per cent lower, primarily as repayments, client upgrades and write-offs more than offset new inflows, including those relating to the sovereign ratings downgrade of Ghana and Sri Lanka and the China commercial real estate sector. Credit-impaired loans represented 2.5 per cent of gross loans and advances, a decrease of 18 basis points.\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio of 57 per cent was lower by 1 percentage point, while the cover ratio post collateral at 76 per cent increased by 1 percentage point.\n\nCredit grade 12 balances have decreased by 9 per cent to $1.6 billion as the sovereign ratings downgrade of Pakistan was more than offset by downgrades into stage 3 primarily as a result of Sri Lanka and Ghana sovereign ratings downgrade.\n\nEarly Alert accounts of $5.0 billion have reduced by 10 per cent, reflecting the net impact of regularisations of accounts back into non-high-risk categories, net impact of downgrades into credit grade 12 and exposure reductions partly offset by new inflows. The Group is continuing to carefully monitor its exposures in vulnerable sectors and select markets, given the unusual stresses caused by the currently challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe proportion of investment grade corporate exposures has increased by 7 percentage points to 76 per cent, reflecting the increase in reverse repurchase agreements held to collect.\n\nThe above balance sheet disclosure relates to loans and advances to customers. The movement in high risk assets (gross stage 3 loans and advances, credit grade 12 balances and early alert accounts) does not fully reflect the impact of the sovereign ratings downgrade of Ghana, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as it does not capture the impact of these downgrades on the Group's investment and securities portfolio.\n\n## Restructuring, goodwill impairment and other items\n\n|                                           | 2022                    | 2022                                       | 2022                  | 2021                    | 2021                                        | 2021                  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                           | Restructuring  $million | Goodwill   and Other  impairment  $million | Other items  $million | Restructuring  $million | Goodwill   and Other  impairment 1 $million | Other items  $million |\n| Operating income                          | 43                      | -                                          | 20                    | (32)                    | -                                           | 20                    |\n| Operating expenses                        | (170)                   | -                                          | -                     | (487)                   | -                                           | (62)                  |\n| Credit impairment                         | 2                       | -                                          | -                     | 9                       | -                                           | -                     |\n| Other impairment                          | (38)                    | (322)                                      | -                     | (17)                    | (300)                                       | -                     |\n| Profit from associates and joint ventures | (11)                    | -                                          | -                     | 20                      | -                                           | -                     |\n| Loss before taxation                      | (174)                   | (322)                                      | 20                    | (507)                   | (300)                                       | (42)                  |\n\nThe Group's statutory performance is adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/ or exceptional transactions that are significant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinarily identify separately when assessing underlying performance period-by period. A reconciliation of restructuring, goodwill impairment and other items excluded from underlying results is set out on pages 126 to 130.\n\nRestructuring charges of $174 million for 2022 reflects the impact of actions to transform the organisation to improve productivity, primarily redundancy related charges.\n\nGoodwill and other impairment of $322 million includes $308 million in relation to a further reduction in the carrying value of the Group's investment in its associate China Bohai Bank (Bohai). To ensure consistency, the Group\n\nhas retrospectively reclassified the $300 million impairment charge taken in 2021 on its investment in Bohai, from other impairment included in underlying operating profit, to goodwill and other impairment which is excluded from underlying operating performance. The remaining $14 million goodwill impairment relates to Bangladesh primarily due to lower economic growth forecasts and higher discount rates.\n\nOther items include a $20 million fair-value gain relating to the sale of a property in Thailand.\n\nThe Group has announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Aviation Finance business as well as the exit of seven markets in the AME region and will focus solely on the CCIB segment in two more. It is expected that the results from the markets and businesses being exited will be reported in restructuring from 1 January 2023 with prior periods retrospectvely restated.",

The point-in-time liquidity coverage ratio of 147 per cent increased 4 per cent and remains well above the minimum regulatory requirement.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\n|                  | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   | Change 1 $million   | Change 1 %   |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| By risk type     |                  |                  |                     |              |\n| Credit risk      | 196,855          | 219,588          | (22,733)            | (10)         |\n| Operational risk | 27,177           | 27,11 6          | 61                  | -            |\n| Market risk      | 20,679           | 24,529           | (3,850)             | (16)         |\n| Total RWAs       | 244,711          | 271,233          | (26,522)            | (10)         |\n\n- 1 Variance is increase/(decrease) comparing current reporting period to prior reporting periods\n\nTotal risk-weighted assets (RWA) decreased 10 per cent or $26.5 billion from 31 December 2021 to $244.7 billion.\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk RWA decreased $22.7 billion to $196.9 billion.

The underlying 50 basis points increase reflects the impact of RWA optimisation actions and profit accretion during the year despite funding $1,258 million of share buy-backs and an increased ordinary dividend. The CET1 ratio is 3.6 percentage points above the Group's current regulatory minimum of 10.4 per cent and at the top end of the Group's 13-14 per cent medium-term target range.\n\nThe regulatory changes which came into force on 1 January 2022 included the cessation of software relief, the impact from the IRB model repair programme and the introduction of standardised rules for counterparty credit risk on derivatives and other instruments (SA-CCR). In aggregate, these regulatory changes resulted in a decrease in the CET1 ratio of approximately 70 basis points by reducing CET1 capital by $1.1 billion and increasing RWAs by $5.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, further regulatory changes including the IRB model repair programme increased RWAs by $1.3 billion, reducing the CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points\n\nThe CET1 ratio was reduced by approximately 70 basis points from a reduction in reserves mainly relating to a reversal of prior year unrealised gains on debt securities as a result of higher market yields and movements in currency translation reducing both the translation reserve and RWAs.\n\nProfit accretion increased the CET1 ratio by approximately 110 basis points whilst lower RWAs as a result of efficiency and optimisation actions within CCIB and Treasury, provided an approximate 120 basis point uplift to the CET1 ratio.\n\nOrdinary shareholder distributions reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 65 basis points. The Group spent $1,258 million purchasing 184 million ordinary shares of $0.50 each during the year, representing a volume-weighted average price per share of \u00a35.48. These shares were subsequently cancelled, reducing the total issued share capital by 6 per cent and the CET1 ratio by approxiamtely 45 basis points. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 14 cents per share resulting in a total 2021 ordinary dividend of 18 cents a share or $523 million, reducing the CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points . Payments due to AT1 and preference shareholders cost approximately 15 basis points.\n\nThe Board has announced a share buy-back for up to a maximum consideration of $1 billion to further reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares. The terms of the buy-back will be announced and the programme will start shortly and is expected to reduce the Group's CET1 ratio in the first quarter of 2023 by approximately 40 basis points.\n\nThe Group's leverage ratio of 4.8 per cent is approximately 10 basis points lower than the 4.9 per cent ratio as at 31 December 2021. This reflects lower Tier 1 capital partly offset by a decrease in leverage exposures largely driven by efficiency and optimisation initiatives. The Group's leverage ratio remains significantly above its current minimum requirement of 3.7 per cent.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOur performance has been strong, and the pace of economic recovery in many of our footprint markets is encouraging.\n\nWhilst recessionary and inflationary pressures will continue to impact many parts of the world, particularly in the first half of 2023, we expect most of the markets in which we operate to continue their recent momentum with GDP growth in the Asian economies at above 5 per cent over the next two years being pivotal to progressive global recovery.\n\nThe recent opening-up of China and the generally receding impacts of COVID-19 should help in that regard albeit we will continue to monitor closely the sovereign risks in markets that are most exposed to tightening liquidity.\n\nOverall, the markets in which we operate, the further benefits of rising interest rates and the evidential improvement in many of our operating metrics cause us to be optimistic about the period ahead. For 2023 and 2024 our expectations are now:\n\n- \u00b7 Income to grow in the 8-10 per cent range excluding DVA and at constant currency\n- \u00b7 Full year average net interest margin of around 175 basis points in 2023 and above 180 basis points in 2024\n- \u00b7 Asset and RWA growth in the low single digit percentage range\n- \u00b7 Around 3 percentage point positive income-to-cost jaws in 2023 and in 2024, excluding DVA and UK bank levy and at constant currency\n- \u00b7 Credit impairment to continue to normalise towards the historic through the cycle loan-loss rate range of 30-35 basis points\n- \u00b7 To operate dynamically within the full 13-14 per cent CET1 target range\n- \u00b7 RoTE to be approaching 10 per cent in 2023\n- \u00b7 RoTE to exceed 11 per cent in 2024, with further growth thereafter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Andy Halford\n\nGroup Chief Financial Officer\n\n16 February 2023",

February 2022 saw Russia's invasion of Ukraine, impacting financial markets, commodity prices and supply chains. We had very limited direct exposure to either country and we proactively managed risks that we faced through indirect exposure, and second order impacts, such as increased energy and food prices or disrupted gas supplies for our clients and customers, the impact from sanctions on asset values and investments some of our clients have in Russia. We also managed the increase in traded risks following increased volatility in other markets, especially credit and commodities. Regular stress tests were performed during 2022 to assess the impact of the war across the Group's portfolio.\n\nIn China, growth forecasts were revised downwards as it followed its 'zero-COVID' stance, exacerbating global supply chain bottlenecks. Pressures in China's commercial real estate industry remain with the timing of recovery still uncertain amidst recent government measures to support the sector. In the United States, the Federal Reserve announced consecutive interest rate hikes to counter inflationary pressures and hinted at more tapered rate rises in 2023. This poses challenges to some emerging markets, as their currencies weaken relative to the strength of the US dollar, by rising commodity prices, stagflation and tighter liquidity.\n\nThe impact from the war, tightening of global financing conditions and idiosyncratic domestic political and policy issues, have placed pressure on sovereign credit ratings during 2022. Within the Group's footprint, Sri Lanka and Ghana embarked on sovereign debt restructuring operations, while Pakistan has been adversely impacted by flooding and continues to face external financing risks in light of large external payments coming due, while FX reserves have declined. The Country Risk Early Warning System (CREWS) is the principal process for tracking a deterioration in risk indicators and has worked effectively during the year. CREWS is a triage system which categorises countries based on a combined assessment of the likelihood of a downgrade and the financial impact of a potential downgrade. Markets in the highest risk category are subject to enhanced monitoring of qualitative and quantitative risk triggers' and we have exposure management strategies in place for the highest risk markets.\n\nWe continue to scan the horizon for topical and emerging risks and collaborate with internal and external partners to mitigate risks as they are identified. Further details on how we manage topical and emerging risks can be found on pages 48 to 51.",

        "page_content": "Asset quality has been maintained, though we remain vigilant in the face of volatile global markets. We continue to demonstrate resilience as evidenced by strong capital and liquidity metrics. Non-financial risks areas such as Fraud, Data Management, Information and Cyber Security, Third Party, Technology, People and Change Management remain heightened. We continue to enhance our operational resilience and defences against these risks through vigorous enhancement programmes. We remain vigilant of sovereign risks and challenges in the property sector in China and we continue to closely monitor and manage these across the Group.\n\nFor our Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) business, we have identified vulnerable sovereigns with triggers and have an action plan for exposure management based on such triggers. We have closely monitored our clients that may face difficulties on account of increasing interest rate, foreign exchange movements, commodity volatility or increase in price of essential goods. Stress tests and portfolio reviews are also done to identify vulnerable exposures. These exposures are then tracked through our well-established Early Alert monitoring process. Actions which may be required if geo-political risks occur are also tracked so that the Group could act quickly if these events do occur.\n\nFor our Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) business, the key focus in 2022 was on the potential wider effects of the deteriorating economic conditions across our markets. While CPBB conducts its business mainly in local currency, the continued strength of the US dollar has an impact in our markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East and we have been monitoring the potential secondary impacts of a decline in sovereign credit quality in some of our markets. For our consumer credit portfolios, we have been monitoring the impact on customer affordability through interest rate sensitivity analysis and tracking consumer price indices across our key markets. In our Business Banking portfolios, we have been focused on the risks to our clients associated with vulnerability to commodity supply chain issues, spikes in input costs and the effect of an overall decline in global demand. For Wealth Lending, which is secured by a largely liquid collateral pool, we have been proactively managing the portfolio through the continued market volatility and monitoring for horizon risks to the collateral, such as reduced corporate earnings in the event of recession. Where appropriate, we have tightened underwriting policies and collateral acceptance criteria.\n\n## An update on our key risk priorities\n\n2022 continued to present a challenging risk landscape, however, we faced this from an intrinsically strong position. Our risk management approach is at the heart of our business and is core to us achieving sustainable growth and performance. We have made progress on our key priorities, these being:\n\nStrengthening the Group's risk culture and conduct: We remain committed to promoting a healthy risk culture and driving the highest standards of conduct. Both risk culture and conduct are integral components of our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF). Our ERMF sets out the guiding principles for our colleagues, enabling us to have integrated and holistic risk conversations across the Group and the three lines of defence. It underpins an enterprise level ability to identify and assess, openly discuss, and take prompt action to address existing and emerging risks. Senior management across the Group promote a healthy risk culture by rewarding risk-based thinking (including in remuneration decisions), challenging the status quo, and creating a transparent and safe environment for employees to communicate risk concerns. We strive to uphold the highest standards of conduct through delivery of conduct outcomes, acknowledging that while incidents cannot be entirely avoided, the Group has no appetite for wilful or negligent misconduct. More broadly, we are continuing to focus on strengthening first-line Conduct Risk ownership, drawing enhanced Conduct Risk insights through the development of conduct analytics as part of the new Conduct Risk management standard. Furthermore, we have uplifted the Group Conduct Risk Management approach which has been achieved through a combination of providing better tools to enable consistent Conduct Risk oversight, increased engagement with the first and second line and targeted campaigns to improve Conduct Risk awareness across the Group. As Conduct Risk may arise from anywhere in the Group at any time, conduct outcomes should always be considered when material strategic decisions are made that may impact clients, investors, shareholders, counterparties, employees, markets, competition and the environment. The Group is also working towards complying with the UK Consumer Duty requirements for in-scope clients; these requirements set higher and clearer standards of consumer protection.",

        "page_content": "Continuous enhancement of our information and cyber security (ICS) capabilities and governance: We have refreshed the Group ICS Risk Strategy by updating our ICS Target Operating Model to increase focus on accountability, risk ownership, change management and executive empowerment. Our Board is regularly engaged on our approach to managing ICS Risks and we have appointed an ICS Risk Special Advisor to the Board. We also perform table-top cyber crisis testing exercises to ensure a consistent view on how to respond to cyber incidents.\n\nTo assess the security of our ICS systems and processes, our ICS capabilities include a formal process for internal controls testing, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing (an authorised simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system). We continue to deploy the Threat Scenario-led Risk Assessment which enables a more dynamic threat-led identification and management of ICS Risk by our businesses. Our ICS policies and standards are also aligned to a number of best practice global guidance, and we remain watchful on proposed new guidance.\n\nOur ICS training programme includes annual mandatory learning and phishing readiness exercises, along with ongoing thematic campaigns which highlight the most prevalent threats and risks that colleagues face. We also deliver regular Group Board training on ICS risks. In addition to general ICS awareness, colleagues in roles identified as critical have additional training linked to their responsibilities.\n\nManaging Climate Risk: Managing the risks from climate change is a core element of our strategy and Stands. We have made good progress this year in embedding Climate Risk considerations across the impacted Principal Risk Types. By using the results from our scenario analysis, we are building a good understanding of the markets and industries where the effects of climate change will have the greatest impact. Climate Risk assessments are now considered as part of Reputational and Sustainability transaction reviews for impacted clients in high-carbon sectors, and integrated into the credit application process for approximately 70 per cent of our corporate client exposure and the physical risk identification of our CPBB mortgage portfolios in our largest markets. As part of our ongoing academic partnership with Imperial College London, we supported new climate research on the range of opportunities that exist for private investors in nature related investments and cross-sectoral implications of electrification of transport in India. Key focus areas for 2023 include establishing and clarifying the linkages between net-zero portfolio management across high transition risk sectors and the impact thereof on Credit Risk parameters, building and embedding our in-house Climate Risk models, training and education, and working with our data providers and clients. All of these support the Group's commitments made as part of Accelerating Zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details can be found at\n\nsc.com/sustainability and sc.com/tcfd\n\nFurther details on our overall approach to net zero can be found at sc.com/netzero\n\n## Managing our environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nrisk: We continue to advance risk management across the organisation in both our CCIB and CPBB client segments with end-to-end reviews of inherent risks and controls in line with our internal Environmental and Social Risk Catalogue. In keeping with our sustainable and transition finance goals, our risk management approach seeks to ensure that our Green, Sustainable and Transition Finance labels reflect the standards set out in our Green and Sustainable Product Framework, Transition Finance Framework and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nManaging Financial Crime Risk: The Group is managing its financial crime risk within acceptable levels as assessed under the Group's risk assessment measures, including the Financial Crime Risk Type Framework, Risk and Control Self-Assessments and assurance reviews. However, some issues in 2022 have required remedial actions in order to avoid an unacceptable increase in Financial Crime Risk in certain areas. Russia-related sanctions have continued to escalate and are increasingly complex in nature to operationalise. While the Group has limited direct exposure to Russia-related sanctions, we continue to monitor and respond to changing sanction requirements. The Group continues to build and maintain partnerships with industry, government and the third sector to build consensus on effective efforts to combat financial crime and the damages it causes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information about the Group's commitment to fighting financial crime can be found at sc.com/fightingfinancialcrime\n\nTechnology and Innovation: Our technology capabilities are delivering our strategy of being a digital driven second-line of defence function, supporting first-line driven risk management processes. We have expanded our Climate Risk reporting capabilities and integrated ESG factors to help streamline risk assessment across the client lifecycle. We have automated the model development lifecycle with a digitised model inventory and approval workflow, and have deployed a single platform to support standardised model creation, review and validation. We have continued to expand our Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance with automated workflows in Operational Risk, Business Continuity, Assurance, and BCBS 239 assessments and peer reviews. Policy documentation management has been transitioned to a new platform and a significantly improved user experience. The Group Risk assessment process has been transitioned to a Big Data technology stack that utilises data more effectively and improves assessment turnaround time. We continue to build more intelligence into our self-service and case management tooling. The ASK Compliance platform serves as a single portal, where the first line of defence and our employees get answers to simple compliance queries using self-service tools, with an enhanced user experience launched in 2022. We will prioritise integrating relevant risk use cases into the existing self-service tools in 2023. Advisor Connect which is a configurable case management framework launched in Q3 2022 provides an auditable, consolidated view of cases and serves as a knowledge repository for the advisory teams. Advisor Connect is planned to be rolled out to prioritised group and country CFCC teams in 2023.",

We continue to explore the application of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Application build through configuration and remain focused on streamlining the identification of new regulations through horizon scanning, tracking amendments to existing regulations, and automating the mapping and impact analysis to policies and processes. Surveillance platforms are continuously enhanced with supervised model-based monitoring and voice and multilingual monitoring capabilities.\n\nDigitalisation and technological developments remain key items on the Group's agenda as we pursue the execution of the Group's strategy. We continue to ensure that our control frameworks and risk appetite evolve accordingly to keep pace with new business developments and asset classes.\n\n## Embedding and strengthening Digital Asset Risk\n\nmanagement capabilities: The Group recognises the increasing prevalence of digital asset activity and associated risks. At present, the Group has very limited, and immaterial, direct exposure to digital asset related activity. Any potential increase in activity or exposures will be subject to detailed review and enhanced due diligence in accordance with the Group's Digital Asset Risk Management Approach. Notwithstanding the limited exposure, as a regulated global Bank with digital asset capabilities, we continue to strengthen our Digital Asset Risk management capabilities under the ERMF, with consideration given to learnings from existing initiatives as well as external market developments.\n\n## Our risk profile and performance in 2022\n\nThe proportion of the Group's gross loans and advances to customers in stage 1 has remained stable at $295.2 billion or 93 per cent (31 December 2021: $279.2 billion or 92 per cent) reflecting our continued focus on high-quality origination. Overall stage 2 gross loans and advances to customers decreased by $3.8 billion to $13.0 billion driven by CCIB due to exposure reductions and rating upgrades in Transport,\n\ntelecom and utilities sectors, $1 billion decrease in the Energy sector, offset by increase in stage 2 in China commercial real estate. Stage 3 loans decreased by $0.2 billion to $7.9 billion (31 December 2021: $8.1 billion) primarily as repayments, client upgrades and write-offs more than offset new inflows, including those relating to the sovereign ratings downgrade of Ghana and Sri Lanka and the China commercial real estate sector. The stage 3 cover ratio of 57 per cent was lower by 1 percentage point, while the cover ratio post collateral at 76 per cent increased by 1 percentage point.\n\nIn 2022, we have seen a 10 per cent decrease in Early Alerts exposure (31 December 2022: $5.0 billion, 31 December 2021: $5.5 billion), reflecting the net impact of regularisations of accounts back into non-high-risk categories, net impact of downgrades into credit grade 12 and exposure reductions partly offset by new inflows. Credit grade 12 balances decreased to $1.6 billion (31 December 2021: $1.7 billion) as the sovereign ratings downgrade of Pakistan was more than offset by downgrades into stage 3 primarily as a result of Sri Lanka and Ghana sovereign ratings downgrade. The Group remains vigilant in view of persistent challenging conditions in some markets and sectors.\n\nThe overall CPBB portfolio remains 86 per cent fully secured (31 December 2021: 86 per cent), with average residential mortgage loan-to-value (LTV) at 44.7 per cent (31 December 2021: 41.1 per cent). The portfolio has remained resilient with overall 30+ days past due across our programme lending segments at 0.58  per cent, which is consistent with prepandemic credit performance.\n\nThe percentage of investment-grade corporate exposure has also increased to 76 per cent compared with 69 per cent from 31 December 2021, reflecting the increase in reverse repurchase agreements held to collect and some increase in exposures to investment grade clients. Exposure to our top 20 corporate clients as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has increased to 65 per cent (31 December 2021: 61 per cent), driven by increased exposure to investment grade clients.\n\n## Key indicators\n\n|                                                                                                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Group total business 1                                                                                     | 316.1  | 304.1  |\n| Stage 1 loans ($ billion)                                                                                  | 295.2  | 279.2  |\n| Stage 2 loans ($ billion)                                                                                  | 13.0   | 16.8   |\n| Stage 3 loans, credit-impaired ($ billion)                                                                 | 7.9    | 8.1    |\n| Stage 3 cover ratio                                                                                        | 57%    | 58%    |\n| Stage 3 cover ratio (including collateral)                                                                 | 76%    | 75%    |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking                                                              |        |        |\n| Investment grade corporate net exposures as a percentage of total corporate net exposures                  | 76%    | 69%    |\n| Loans and advances maturing in one year or less as a percentage of total loans and advances   to customers | 65%    | 66%    |\n| Early alert portfolio net exposures ($ billion)                                                            | 5.0    | 5.5    |\n| Credit grade 12 balances ($ billion)                                                                       | 1.6    | 1.7    |\n| Aggregate top 20 corporate net exposures as a percentage of Tier 1 capital 2                               | 65%    | 61%    |\n| Collateralisation of sub-investment grade net exposures maturing in more than one year                     | 53%    | 49%    |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                                                                       |        |        |\n| Loan-to-value ratio of Consumer, Private & Business Banking mortgages                                      | 44.7%  | 41.1%  |",

        "page_content": "The Group's ongoing credit impairment was a net charge of $838 million (31 December 2021: $263 million), including a $83 million charge split across CCIB and Central and other items segments relating to sovereign ratings downgrade of Pakistan into credit grade 12. The impairment charge includes $582 million in relation to China commercial real estate sector and $283 million in relation to sovereign downgrades, partly offset by releases in the management overlay relating to COVID-19.\n\nCCIB stage 1 and 2 impairments of $148 million are driven by China commercial real estate downgrades, including a $78 million increase for China commercial real estate overlay and sovereign downgrades in Africa and the Middle East which is offset by a $102 million full release of COVID-19 overlay. Stage 3 impairment of $279 million is largely from China commercial real estate downgrades, clients' rating changes due to the Sri Lanka and Ghana sovereign rating downgrade, offset by releases and repayments of a few notable clients.\n\nCPBB charge decreased by $20 million to $262 million (31 December 2021: $282 million).  Stage 1 and 2 charge increased by $121 million to $150 million (31 December 2021: $29 million). Stage 3 charge decreased by $141 million to $112 million (31 December 2021: $253 million) as markets returned to normalised flows following the expiry of the majority of COVID-19 relief schemes in 2021. In 2022, there were increased charges for Korea and Taiwan due to worsening macroeconomic forecasts, as well as China due to portfolio maturity and book growth. This was offset by a net release of $110 million (31 December 2021: $15 million) in management overlays and a $25 million release from significant increase in credit risk methodology changes and model updates largely in the Asia region.\n\nVentures impairment charge increased by $13 million to $16 million (31 December 2021: $3 million) due to book growth in Mox Bank and Trust Bank Singapore.\n\nCentral and other items stage 1 and 2 impairments of $95 million were driven by the sovereign downgrades in Asia. Stage 3 impairment charge of $38 million was driven by the sovereign rating downgrade of Ghana and Sri Lanka.\n\n## Credit impairment\n\n|                                                 | 2022                  | 2022              | 2022            | 2021                  | 2021              | 2021            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                 | Stage 1 & 2  $million | Stage 3  $million | Total  $million | Stage 1 & 2  $million | Stage 3  $million | Total\u00b9 $million |\n| Ongoing business portfolio                      |                       |                   |                 |                       |                   |                 |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 148                   | 279               | 427             | 23                    | (67)              | (44)            |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking            | 150                   | 112               | 262             | 29                    | 253               | 282             |\n| Ventures                                        | 13                    | 3                 | 16              | 3                     | -                 | 3               |\n| Central & other items                           | 95                    | 38                | 133             | 23                    | (1)               | 22              |\n| Credit impairment charge/(release)              | 406                   | 432               | 838             | 78                    | 185               | 263             |\n| Restructuring business portfolio                |                       |                   |                 |                       |                   |                 |\n| Others                                          | (2)                   | -                 | (2)             | (2)                   | (7)               | (9)             |\n| Credit impairment charge/(release)              | (2)                   | -                 | (2)             | (2)                   | (7)               | (9)             |\n| Total credit impairment charge/ (release)       | 404                   | 432               | 836             | 76                    | 178               | 254             |\n\nThe average level of total trading and non-trading Value at Risk (VaR) in 2022 was $52.5 million, 4.2 per cent lower than 2021 ($54.8 million). The actual level of total trading and non-trading VaR as at the end of the 2022 was $55.8 million, 28.6 per cent higher than 2021 ($43.4 million), due to an increase in market volatility in H2 2022, driven by a number of Central Banks increasing interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nOur Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is 147 per cent (31 December 2021: 143 per cent) with a surplus to both Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements. The Group's advances-to-deposits ratio has decreased from 59.1 per cent to 57.4 per cent, driven by a reduction of 2 per cent in our customer deposits and 5 per cent in customer loans and advances.\n\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is 14.0 per cent (31 December 2021: 14.1 per cent).

It gives us the structure to manage existing risks effectively in line with our Risk Appetite, as well as allowing for holistic risk identification.\n\n## Principal and Integrated Risk Types\n\nPrincipal risks are risks inherent in our strategy and business model. These are formally defined in our ERMF which provides a structure for monitoring and controlling these risks through the Board-approved Risk Appetite. We will not compromise adherence to our Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns. The table below provides an overview of the Group's principal and integrated risks and risk appetite statement. In addition to principal risks, the Group has defined a Risk Appetite Statement for Climate Risk.\n\n| Principal Risk Types                       | Risk Appetite Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit Risk                                | The Group manages its credit exposures following the principle of diversification across  products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Traded Risk                                | The Group should control its financial markets activities to ensure that Traded Risk losses do not  cause material damage to the Group's franchise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Treasury Risk                              | The Group should maintain sufficient capital, liquidity and funding to support its operations,   and an interest rate profile ensuring that the reductions in earnings or value from movements   in interest rates impacting banking book items do not cause material damage to the Group's  franchise.

        "page_content": "## Topical and Emerging Risks\n\nTopical Risks refer to themes that may have emerged but are still evolving rapidly and unpredictably, while Emerging Risks refer to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes from certain events which may have the potential to adversely impact our business.\n\nAs part of our continuous risk identification process, we have updated the Group's Topical and Emerging Risks (TERs) from those disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report. We summarise these below, outlining the risk trend changes since the end of 2021, and the mitigating actions we are taking based on our current knowledge and assumptions. This reflects the latest internal assessment as performed by senior management.\n\nThe TER list is not exhaustive and there may be additional risks which could have an adverse effect on the Group. Our mitigation approach for these risks may not eliminate them but shows the Group's awareness and attempt to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and materialise over time, management will take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk based on its impact on the Group.\n\nThe key changes to the TERs since the 2021 Annual Report are as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 We have added two new TERs: 'High inflation and US dollar strength' and 'Global economic downturn risk'. This reflects that continued inflation and consequent rate hikes will impact global growth, with a chance of global recession in 2023.\n- \u00b7 'Energy security' has been broadened to 'Energy security and shifting political alliances' to reflect those practicalities around energy security, that may reshape some political relationships, with a shift in power towards exporters.\n- \u00b7 'Supply chain dislocations' has been renamed as 'Extended supply chain issues and key material shortages' due to continuing supply shortages and restrictions of some exports, the impact of Russia-Ukraine war and China-US rivalry, and the push for sustainable alternative supply chains.\n- \u00b7 'Social unrest' and 'Adapting to endemic COVID-19 and a K-shaped recovery' are no longer presented as independent TERs; rather they are now considered as drivers for other overarching themes.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Considerations\n\nThere is interconnectedness between risks due to the importance of US dollar financing conditions for global markets, and the global or concentrated nature of key supply chains for energy, food, semi-conductors and rare metals. The Group is exposed directly through investments, or indirectly through its clients to these risks. While the main risk impacts are financial, other ramifications may exist, for example, reputational, compliance or operational considerations.\n\n## High inflation and US dollar strength\n\nInflation is now a global concern and a top policy issue in many countries which are experiencing the highest inflation levels in decades. Prices have surged due to a combination of customer demand and supply shortages.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's sustained fight against US inflation has led to US dollar appreciation against many other global currencies. This increases global import costs and debt servicing costs on US dollar denominated debt. There have been widespread price corrections for some asset classes. Some markets, especially emerging markets, have limited options to defend their currencies without causing other detrimental effects.\n\nThe operating environment is likely to be testing for the Non Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) sector; segments within it could find it challenging to manage liquidity, credit, refinancing and market risk. The Archegos collapse of 2021 and the liability-driven investments volatility are the most notable recent examples.  There are heightened expectations from major regulators with regard to the management of NBFI risks.\n\nPrice inflation for essential goods, such as food and fuel has prompted a cost-of-living crisis across both developed and emerging markets in which the Group operates. This has sparked social unrest in some countries, with a heightened risk in emerging markets which experience disproportionate effects. However, the impact is felt across a wider bracket, including the vast global middle class, which raises the threat of instability, even in traditionally less volatile countries.\n\n## Global economic downturn risk\n\nContinued tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation in developed markets has contributed to the possibility of a global recession in 2023. Higher rates could increase debt distress levels across both developed and emerging economies.\n\nGlobal growth slowed to 3.4 per cent in 2022, with the outlook for 2023 growth remaining muted at 2.9 per cent. Although China's reopening could lead to a faster than expected recovery, supply chain bottlenecks remain and severe COVID-19 outbreaks could lead to a reversal. Geopolitical escalation could also limit the speed of recovery, and supply chain restrictions may lead to deglobalisation and less efficient international trade.\n\nThe Group is exposed to downturns in China, such as observed turbulence in the property development sector.",

        "page_content": "## Expanding array of global tensions\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has catalysed a fundamental shift in power dynamics with a demarcation of underlying political alliances. Pressure is mounting on Russia, which may lead to increasingly desperate military and political actions.\n\nRelations between China and other developed markets, particularly in the West, remain fragile, with sanctions being imposed by both sides. Increasing technological restrictions and potential escalations in relation to Taiwan's sovereignty are among a number of flashpoints. Economic geopolitical actions could also escalate distrust, decoupling, and increase inefficient production, potentially generating further inflationary pressures.\n\nElection wins for extremist parties in a number of countries are adding to increased vulnerability and volatility - especially as economics is becoming subservient to politics. Volatility in traditionally stable economies could cause further disruption.\n\nRivalry between the United States and China may have structural, operational and strategic impacts on business models for companies that straddle both.\n\n## Emerging markets sovereign risk\n\nEmerging markets have been squeezed by escalating oil and food prices, high interest rates and the legacy of COVID-19 on key industries such as tourism.\n\nDistress has already been observed across several of the Group's footprint markets, including defaults in Sri Lanka and Ghana, political instability in Pakistan, high inflation in T\u00fcrkiye, and issues across Africa, particularly economies that are sensitive to fuel prices.\n\nFor some countries with fragile governance frameworks, there is a heightened risk of failure to manage social demands, which might culminate in increased political vulnerability. Furthermore, food and energy security challenges have the potential to drive other social impacts.\n\nTightening of financial conditions in developed markets has also led to local currency depreciations against the US dollar, increasing debt servicing costs, and potentially restricting debt re-financing. Foreign Exchange reserves have already been heightened depleted in some markets, and local monetary policy may undermine already weak growth.\n\n## Extended supply chain issues and key material shortages\n\nDemand and supply imbalances in global supply chains have become persistent as they are increasingly structural in nature. The main dislocations are linked to conflict and political restrictions on trade or investment. Repercussions range from companies that are a party in the particular supply chain, to end consumers and sovereigns.\n\nConcentrated impacts to specific key industries such as semi-conductors can have contagion effects. Political wrangling over technological supremacy further increases the risk of market disruption and a retreat from globalisation. Potential targeted restrictions on semiconductors could lead to complete restructuring of global supply chains, impacting most sectors.\n\nThis could lead to a shift in supply chains for the future, with increased contingency costs and production potentially moving closer to consumers. This is further compounded by increased scrutiny around the environmental and social impacts of supply chains.\n\n## Energy security and shifting political alliances\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated an already strained energy supply model in developed markets, spurring a rapid pivot away from traditional supply lines. This came amid already increased tensions between nations as negotiating power shifted towards energy exporters.\n\nRising energy prices and potential supply shortfalls may cause a rise in social unrest, especially in countries where there is high dependence on energy imports.\n\nIn the wake of the conflict, a trade-off between pragmatism and environmentalism has materialised, with significant divergence as some countries have embraced the renewables opportunity while others have reversed, with rollbacks of green policies observed in some markets. Policymakers must balance supply and price pressures with climate goals, with a heightened risk of short term crises diverting attention and resources away from longer term required climate action.\n\nRising material costs will also impact renewable energy development, potentially slowing the transition. The Group's plans for sustainable finance business growth could be achieved at a slower than expected pace.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We conduct thematic stress tests and portfolio reviews at a Group, country, and business level to assess the impact of extreme but plausible events and manage the portfolio accordingly.\n- \u00b7 Vulnerable sectors are regularly reviewed and exposures to these sectors are managed as part of Credit Risk reviews.\n- \u00b7 Sovereign ratings, exposures, outlooks and country risk limits are regularly monitored, and mitigating actions taken as required.\n- \u00b7 Exposures that may result in material credit impairment and increased risk-weighted assets are closely monitored and managed.\n- \u00b7 We utilise Credit Risk mitigation techniques including credit insurance and collateral.\n- \u00b7 We track the participation of our footprint countries in G20's Common Framework Agreement and Debt Service Suspension Initiative for Debt Treatments and the associated exposure.\n- \u00b7 We remain vigilant in monitoring geopolitical relationships. Increased scrutiny is applied when onboarding clients in sensitive industries and in ensuring compliance with sanctions.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental and Social Considerations\n\n## ESG stakeholder expectations\n\nEnvironmental targets are becoming embedded in global business models, with increased pressure to set ambitious sustainability goals or apply more restrictions on financing to sensitive sectors.\n\nThere is also an increase in stakeholder expectations around fair and balanced disclosures, including marketing campaigns. Scrutiny around greenwashing has accelerated with various regulatory developments, such as the Financial Conduct Authority's consultation on anti-greenwashing rules.\n\nThere is fragmentation in the pace and scale of adoption and regulation around the world, which adds complexity in managing a global business. Fragmentation in ESG taxonomies may also lead to unintended consequences, including misallocation of capital, political and litigation risks.\n\nHuman rights concerns are increasing in focus with scope expanding beyond direct abuses to cover other areas such as data management, technological advancement, and supply chains.\n\nThere are risks if the Group is required to adapt to new fragmented regulations quickly, as well as meeting publicly stated sustainability goals and helping clients transition.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 Increased scrutiny is applied to environmental and social standards when providing services to clients.\n- \u00b7 We monitor regulatory developments in relation to sustainable finance and ESG risk management and provide feedback on consultations bilaterally and through industry groups on emerging topics.\n- \u00b7 We focus on minimising our environmental impact and embedding our values through our Position Statements for sensitive sectors and a list of prohibited activities that the Group will not finance.\n- \u00b7 We are integrating the management of greenwashing risks into our Reputational and Sustainability Risk Type Framework, policies and standards. Green, Sustainable and Transition Finance labels for products, clients and transactions reflect the standards set out in our Green and Sustainable Product Framework, Transition Finance Framework and TCFD reporting. We regularly review these frameworks and annually obtain external verification on the Sustainable Finance asset pool.\n- \u00b7 The Group is committed to respecting universal human rights and we assess our clients and suppliers against various international principles, as well as through our social safeguards and supplier charter. More details can be found in our Modern Slavery Statement and Human Rights Position Statement.\n- \u00b7 Detailed portfolio reviews and stress tests are conducted to test resilience to climate-related risks, in line with applicable regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 Work is under way to embed Climate Risk considerations across all relevant Principal Risk Types. This includes stress testing/scenario analysis, integration of client Climate Risk assessments within the Credit process, building an internal modelling capability and linkages with our net zero targets to understand the financial risks and opportunities from climate change.\n\n## Technological Considerations\n\n## Data and Digital\n\nRegulatory requirements and client expectations relating to data management and quality, including data protection and privacy, data sovereignty, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the ethical use of data are increasing. Regulation is also becoming more fragmented and complex, requiring more resources to ensure ongoing compliance.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have added impetus to data sovereignty legislation, sometimes extraterritorial in nature. There can also be conflicting guidance within the same jurisdiction. There is heightened focus on economic sanctions and financial crime controls, reinforcing the need for robust control frameworks.\n\nData protection risks are increasingly driven by highly organised and sophisticated threat actors, with developments such as ransomware available as a service.\n\nData is becoming more concentrated in the hands of governments and big private companies, with relatively few providers of new technologies such as cloud services. Some third parties are reluctant to disclose AI model details, citing intellectual property, which increases model risk.\n\nA balance between resilience and agility is required, as new technologies are onboarded while existing systems are maintained. Clear ownership, frameworks and oversight of new technologies is also required.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We monitor regulatory developments in relation to all aspects of data management, taking into account country specific requirements. We take a holistic view across data risks to facilitate an efficient and comprehensive risk control environment.\n- \u00b7 We have established a Data Management and Privacy Operations team to assist with compliance with data management regulations. This includes a dedicated AI governance forum which includes review of third party solutions.\n- \u00b7 We have an inflight programme of work to drive compliance to BCBS 239 requirements on effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting.\n- \u00b7 We continue to deliver new controls and capabilities to increase our ability to identify, detect, protect and respond to ICS threats.\n\n## New business structures, channels and competition\n\nFailure to harness new technologies and new business models would place banks at a competitive disadvantage. However, these innovations require specialist skills, present new vectors for threats to materialise and require robust risk assessment accordingly. Differing access to new developments will also cause divergence and inequality to grow across countries and social groups.\n\nDigital assets are gaining adoption and linked business models continue to increase in prominence. These present material opportunities for businesses and consumers, as well as potential risks as the space evolves, as evidenced by the collapse of Futures Exchange (FTX) and other recent events, further exacerbating digital asset market volatility.\n\nIncreasing use of partnerships and alliances increases exposure to third-party risk. There is also risk of inadequate risk assessments of new and unfamiliar activities.",

This is regularly updated in response to evolving digital assets market activity.\n- \u00b7 Strategic partnerships and alliances are being set up with Fintechs to enhance our competitiveness.\n\n## People Considerations\n\n## Talent pool of the future\n\nThe expectations of the workforce, especially skilled workers, are significantly shifting. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated changes on how people work, connect and collaborate, with expectations on flexible working now a given. The focus is increasingly on 'what' work people do and 'how' they get to deliver it, which are becoming differentiators in the war for future skills. There is greater desire to seek meaning and personal fulfilment at work that is aligned to individual purpose.\n\nThese trends are even more distinct among Millennials and Gen Zs who make up an increasing proportion of the global talent pool, and as digital natives also possess the attributes and skills we seek to pursue our strategy.\n\nWith attrition increasing year on year, to sustainably attract, grow and retain talent, we must continue to invest in and further strengthen our Employee Value Proposition (EVP), through both firm-wide interventions as well as targeted action.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 Our culture and EVP work is designed to address the emerging expectations of the diverse talent we seek. The quarterly Brand and Culture Dashboard monitors our D&I Index and colleagues' perceptions of our EVP and whether we are living our Valued Behaviours.  Local Management teams discuss the dashboard to identify actions, supported by a central library of interventions from across the Group.\n- \u00b7 Our Future Workplace Now programme, which formalises hybrid working where suitable, has been rolled out across 43 markets, and 78 per cent of colleagues in these markets are now on flexi-working arrangements.  We continue to monitor for potential people risks, and mitigating actions include hybrid learning festivals, watercooler moments toolkits, a social connections platform and people leader guidance.\n- \u00b7 We are undertaking a multi-year journey of developing future-skills by creating a culture of continuous learning, to balance between 'building' and 'inducting' skills. We are deploying technology that democratises access to learning content and developmental experiences.\n- \u00b7 To address our talent pool's increased expectations of us being purpose-led, we have published our Stands which guide our strategy.",

We strive to maintain open and constructive relationships with a wide range of stakeholders including regulators, lawmakers, clients, investors, civil society and community groups.\n\nIn 2022, we made improvements to some of our feedback processes, so that client needs could be addressed by relationship managers as they emerged. Our engagement took many forms, including one-to-one sessions using online channels and calls, virtual roundtables, written responses and targeted surveys. These conversations, and the issues that underpin them, help inform our business strategy and support us to operate as a responsible and sustainable business.\n\nStakeholder feedback, where appropriate, is communicated internally to senior management through the relevant forums and governing committees such as the Sustainability Forum, and to the Board's Culture and Sustainability Committee (CSC) which oversees the Group's approach to its main relationships with stakeholders.\n\nWe communicate progress regularly to external stakeholders through channels such as sc.com, established social media platforms and this report. More detailed information on material sustainability topics can be found in our Sustainability section on pages 64 to 124.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clients\n\n## How we create value\n\nWe want to deliver easy, everyday banking solutions to our clients in a simple and cost-effective way with a great customer experience. We enable individuals to grow and protect their wealth; we help businesses trade, transact, invest and expand; and we help a variety of financial institutions, including banks, public sector and development organisations, with their banking needs.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nIn 2022, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) strengthened its annual feedback process by capturing how clients feel about what we offer, including advice, customer service and digital channels.\n\nCCIB also focused on building a consistent digital experience and accelerated delivery through Cash, Trade, Financial Markets and Data Solutions.\n\nThis was further enabled with self-serve digital tools and capabilities such as chatbot, our mobile banking app, application programming interface (API) connectivity and data analytics, which reduced operating costs and improved client experience. Our agile working practices have also accelerated our speed of decision-making and change delivery to meet client needs faster.\n\nRefining our processes through continuous improvement has enabled us to achieve benefits in revenue and costs savings by creating capacity and reducing client waiting times.\n\nAs an integrated team, we drove digital transformation and leveraged networks in service to our clients on our proprietary platforms across 47 markets. We have processes and guidelines in place, specific to each of our client businesses, to understand and respond to issues and promptly resolve complaints.\n\nMeanwhile, we continued to engage with our clients to help them expand across borders, using our international network to help them access existing and new trade corridors. Our presence in high-growth markets - and ongoing roll out of digital platforms - helps connect our clients to the global engines of trade and innovation.\n\nAs part of our aim to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, our newly-formed transition finance team have been working closely with our clients in hard-to-abate sectors on their own transition planning. This is in addition to our plan to mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance between 2021 and 2030.\n\nAcross both CCIB and Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB), we have processes and controls to mitigate greenwashing risks, and to support transparency we publish the details of what constitutes our sustainable investments universe externally.\n\n## Accelerating adoption of our API offerings\n\nWe are committed to helping our corporate clients achieve the benefits of real-time treasury operations, so we developed an application programming interface (API) banking platform for foreign exchange transactions, payment initiation, payment status and account balances. Our Premium Banking APIs were awarded the title of 'Top Performer' in the FinLync 2022 Power Rankings Report, in recognition of our revamped API Marketplace and sandbox for testing APIs.\n\nIn CPBB, we work closely with third-party ESG data providers to support the development of product ideas, and extensive due diligence is conducted by our in-house team on our high conviction suite of sustainable funds.",

This includes building capability to protect our clients against evolving risks in the ecosystem like fraud and cyber security and comes with education and increased client communication.\n\nIn order to act in the best interests of our clients, we use our insights gathered from our data alongside robust policies, procedures and the Group's risk appetite to design and offer products and services that meet client needs, regulatory requirements and Group performance targets, while contributing to a sustainable and resilient environment.\n\nWealth and Personal Banking products have increased sustainable product options for distribution to our clients. We now offer sustainable deposits in seven markets, green mortgages in six markets, sustainable investments in 16 markets and carbon-neutral cards in 17 markets.\n\nAll new products are subjected to a comprehensive approvals process. For investment products sold to individuals, this includes risk scores which aid our assessment of client suitability. We consider each client's financial needs and personal circumstances to assist us in offering suitable product recommendations.\n\nWe achieve this using a globally consistent methodology that takes into consideration local regulatory requirements to review product risks against the client's risk appetite, considering financial objectives, financial ability, and knowledge. Clients are also provided with clear and simple documentation that outlines key product features and risks prior to executing a transaction.\n\nFees and charges are disclosed to clients in line with regulatory requirements and industry best practice, and where available, benchmarked against competitors. For Personal and Business Banking products, agreed interest rates, fees and other charges as billed to clients are monitored and assessed locally, with global oversight.\n\nTriggers for outlier fees and charges are defined and subject to annual review. Complaints are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are one of the factors that are taken into account prior to amendments to annual interest, fees and charges. We also assess our product portfolio for new risks to ensure they remain appropriate for client needs and aligned to emerging regulation. These quantitative and qualitative assessments, including Periodic Product Reviews, are intended to provide a complete view of whether to continue, enhance, grow or retire products.\n\nThroughout 2022, we also maintained our sharp focus on improving the client experience across the Bank. We engaged with clients to show them the opportunities trade corridors could bring and how using our network could help them flourish.\n\nOur focus on partnerships in CPBB is showing results with new partnerships launched in Vietnam, Indonesia and more recently Singapore in addition to the partnerships we have in China. These partnerships have incrementally acquired 1.2 million clients, many of whom have the potential to avail themselves of the full suite of CPBB products.\n\n2022 saw a significant increase in our digital wealth capabilities with the delivery of Online Equity platforms in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates and the myWealth Direct service in Hong Kong which offers personalised insights and investment ideas directly to clients.\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to listen and respond to stakeholder priorities and concerns, addressing feedback as it emerges, strengthen our digital transformation and innovation capabilities, and support our clients as they transition to net zero.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Differentiated product and service offering\n- \u00b7 Digitally enabled and positive experience\n- \u00b7 Sustainable finance\n- \u00b7 Access to international markets",

We also engaged with officials on the financial services regulatory environment, in particular on prudential, financial markets, conduct and financial crime frameworks.\n\nIn support of this, we have a Group Public and Regulatory Affairs team responsible for engagement as well as identifying and analysing relevant policies, legislation and regulation. This work is overseen by various governance forums within the Bank, which comprise senior executives representing business and control functions to support alignment between advocacy and business strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on our engagement with regulators and governments, as well as our industry and membership associations please see sc.com/politicalengagement\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Strong capital base and liquidity position\n- \u00b7 Robust standards for conduct and financial crime\n- \u00b7 Healthy economies and competitive markets\n- \u00b7 Positive sustainable development\n- \u00b7 Digital innovation in financial services\n- \u00b7 Operational resilience\n- \u00b7 Customer protection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investors\n\n## How we create value\n\nWe aim to deliver robust returns and long-term sustainable value for our investors.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nWe rely on capital from debt and equity investors to execute our business model. Whether they have short or long-term investment horizons, we provide our investors with information about progress against our strategic and financial frameworks.\n\nThrough our footprint and the execution of our sustainability agenda, we provide our investors with exposure to opportunities in emerging markets. We believe that our integrated approach to ESG issues, as well as a strong risk and compliance culture, are key differentiators.\n\n## Investors continued\n\nThe Group has delivered a strong performance in 2022, with return on tangible equity (RoTE) back above pre-pandemic levels. We are executing well against the five strategic actions we set out earlier in the year while navigating through a challenging external environment. Our aim is to accelerate the delivery of our ambition of double-digit RoTE.\n\nRegular and transparent engagement with our investors, and the wider market, helps us understand investors' needs and tailor our public information accordingly. In addition to direct engagement from our Investor Relations team, we communicate through quarterly, half and full-year results, conferences, roadshows, investor days and media releases. There was continued adoption of virtual mediums during the year, coupled with a growing number of face-to-face interactions from the very low levels seen in the last two years. We hosted two capital market days, focusing on our Financial Markets business and Consumer, Private and Business Banking Affluent Clients in June and November respectively.\n\n## Principal Board decision - market entries and exits\n\nWe are accelerating our strategy to deliver efficiencies, reduce complexity and drive scale. During 2022, the Board approved a set of actions to focus resources within the Africa and Middle East (AME) region to those areas where they can have the greatest scale and growth potential, for the benefit of our shareholders, employees and customers.\n\nSubject to regulatory approval, we intend to exit onshore operations in seven markets in AME, and in a further two markets to focus solely on our CCIB business. The Group has invested heavily in recent years in the AME region, including fundamentally transforming its digital capabilities in its African markets. It has also been expanding its footprint to cover some of the largest and fastest-growing economies, having recently opened its first branch in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and obtained preliminary approval for a banking licence in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The seven markets where there will be a full exit of operations are Angola, Cameroon, Gambia, Jordan, Lebanon, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. In Tanzania and Cote d'Ivoire, the Consumer, Private and Business Banking businesses will be exited and the focus will turn solely to CCIB.\n\nAs part of the Board's decision-making, it recognised that there were a number of potential challenges, risks, costs and significantly impacted stakeholders to consider, which management was also aware of. Carefully designed and executed engagement with regulators, governments and employees, as well as with other key stakeholders, continues to be crucial. The Board has received regular updates since the decision was made.",

Standard Chartered PLC's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May was open to shareholders to attend either in person or electronically where they were provided a platform to view a live video feed of the meeting. All participants were provided with the opportunity to submit their votes and ask the Board questions.\n\nSimilarly, the Group Chairman, alongside some members of the Board, hosted a 'hybrid' stewardship event for institutional investors in November which provided a platform for shareholders to receive an update on a number of topics, including sustainability, net zero and governance matters. The event included an open question-and-answer session across a range of key issues.\n\nAn external investor sentiment survey was also conducted on an anonymous basis during the year, seeking insight into how the Group was perceived, to identify areas of focus for investors and understand how the Group could improve its investor communications. This was particularly important given the changes in the external environment and the evolution of the Group's strategy. The Board discussed key areas which it should focus on to address concerns highlighted by investors and emerging from the report.\n\nWe continue to respond to growing interest from a wide range of stakeholders on ESG matters, including investors. We sought shareholder endorsement for our net zero pathway at the AGM, intended as a means by which we will measure progress, engage and gather views. We also work with sustainability analysts and participate in sustainability indices that benchmark our performance, including the Carbon Disclosure Product (CDP) Climate Change survey and Workforce Disclosure Initiative.\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to engage with investors on progress against our strategic priorities and actions, as well as our financial framework as we progress towards our returns target.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Safe, strong and sustainable financial performance\n- \u00b7 Facilitation of sustainable finance to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n- \u00b7 Progress on ESG matters, including advancing our net zero agenda\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## How we create value\n\nThrough the engagement of suppliers, both locally and globally, we seek to support our business with the provision of efficient and sustainable goods and services.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nSupplier selection, due diligence and contract management process is guided by our Third-Party Risk Management Policy and Standards. In 2022, we further strengthened our supplier governance given potential increased risk and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nOur Supplier Charter sets out our aspirations in relation to ethics, human rights, diversity and inclusion (D&I), and environmental performance. All newly onboarded suppliers are expected to agree to adhere with the principles set out in our Supplier Charter. We seek to reinforce this through the terms of our standard contract templates, where possible, and we further encourage alignment to this by sending an annual letter to all our active suppliers. This also includes guidance regarding our technology platforms, sustainability aspirations, payment processes and other relevant principles such as Anti Bribery and Corruption.\n\nWe select and work with suppliers whom we believe support us to provide efficient and value-adding goods and services to our businesses both globally and locally. For example, during 2022, we partnered closely with our credit/debit card manufacturing supplier Thales, who went the extra mile to accommodate our demand amidst a scarcity of chips. This resulted in the Bank being able to successfully fulfil the spike in demand, due to the very successful launch of our Singapore digital-only bank - Trust Bank - securing our market positioning and fulfilling customer expectations.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to make progress on our supply-chain sustainability agenda. In pursuit of our ambition of achieving net zero in our operations by 2025, we continued to offset emissions from our business flights. In partnership with an independent climate consultancy, we continued refining the Scope 3 upstream emissions measurement methodology which was used to estimate our supplier emissions.\n\nOur Stands have served to further embed our supplier D&I approach. In 2022, we started to report and monitor supplier D&I indicators across our footprint, and 93 per cent 1 of our core markets now have supplier D&I programmes to help accelerate progress and impact in our local communities. So far, more than 1,500 employees have been trained internally to build capability to deliver our supplier D&I aims.\n\nIn addition, we continue to partner with multiple local and global non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to identify and onboard more sustainable and diverse-owned suppliers across our core markets.",

This provides women employees and clients in Kenya with the option to work and travel in a safe environment. An-Nisa's overall vision is to increase employment opportunities for women in what is currently a male-dominated sector. Working with An-Nisa means Standard Chartered can directly contribute to positively impacting the life of the women who own and drive the taxis.\n\nIn 2023, supply chain sustainability will continue to be a primary focus. We intend to progress integration of environmental and social risks into our Third-Party Risk Management Framework.

To shape our strategy, we aim for constructive dialogue that helps us to understand alternative perspectives and that our approach to doing business is understood. This includes working with NGOs that approach us about a specific client, transaction or policy.\n\nIn 2022, climate change, our net zero pathway, human rights and biodiversity continued to underpin many of our conversations. We primarily received NGO feedback via our public inbox and responded to queries in line with our Reporting & Engagement Standard. For complex issues such as climate change, we held bilateral virtual meetings with NGOs to exchange perspectives in greater depth. In advance of our AGM, we commissioned GlobeScan, a leading market research provider, to conduct 20 stakeholder interviews with leaders across NGOs, academia, business and specialty research institutes from seven countries to analyse how our net zero pathway aligns to external expectations.\n\nIn 2023, we anticipate mapping our NGO relationships to identify topics and geographies where we can strengthen our engagement.\n\nWe hosted a third edition of the Futuremakers Forum, bringing together over 1,700 clients, employers, NGOs, employees and project participants from 61 markets to build partnerships and create economic opportunities focused on young people. Through the two-day virtual event, we deepened our understanding of financial products and services young people want and need to unleash their full potential.\n\nTo increase employee engagement, we launched Mentors Den for almost 400 colleagues across 12 markets to provide career advice and support to over 650 Futuremakers participants. In 2022, Futuremakers reached 335,386 young people with education, employability and entrepreneurship opportunities.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change and decarbonisation\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity and animal welfare\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Financial inclusion\n- \u00b7 Social impact",

To lead the way in addressing the evolving needs of our clients and the advances in technology, we are developing a workforce that is futureready and are co-creating with our employees an inclusive, innovative and client-centric culture that drives ambition, action and accountability.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nBy engaging employees and fostering a positive experience for them, we can better serve our clients and deliver on our Purpose and Stands. A culture of inclusion and ambition enables us to unlock innovation, make better decisions, deliver our business strategy, live our valued behaviours and embody our brand promise: here for good. We proactively assess and manage people-related risks, for example, organisation, capability and culture, as part of our Group risk management framework.\n\nOur People Strategy, which was approved by the Board in mid-2019, stays relevant and future-focused, with the pandemic having accelerated many of the future of work trends which informed our approach.\n\n## Their interests\n\nTranslating our here for good brand promise and Purpose +of 'Driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity' into our colleagues' day-to-day experience is critical to us remaining an employer of choice across our footprint. The research we have on our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) tells us that our employees, or potential employees, want to: have interesting and impactful jobs; innovate within a unique set of markets and clients; cultivate a brand that sustainably drives commerce and offers enriching careers and development; and be supported by great people leaders. They want these elements to be anchored in competitive rewards and a positive work-life balance. The employment proposition is a key input to our People Strategy which supports the delivery of our business strategy.\n\n## Listening to employees\n\nFrequent feedback from employee surveys helps us identify and close gaps between colleagues' expectations and their experience. In addition to our annual survey, we use continuous-listening mechanisms that capture colleague sentiment more frequently, through a rolling culture survey and through surveys at key moments for our employees, such as when they join us, when they leave, and when they return to work after parental leave.\n\nIn 2022, our annual My Voice survey was conducted in May and June: 87 per cent of our employees (65,988) and 44 per cent of eligible agency workers (1,797) participated in the survey.\n\nKey measures of employee satisfaction have stayed stable in 2022, with an increase in our employee Net Promoter Score (NPS) (which measures whether employees would recommend working for us) and a slight drop in our employee engagement index. We are encouraged to see that 96 per cent of employees feel committed to doing what is required to help the Group succeed, 88 per cent feel proud about working for the Group, and 83 per cent say that the Group meets or exceeds their expectations. The scores indicate that we have continued to improve as a place to work.\n\nIn addition to leveraging inputs from employee surveys, the Board and Management Team also engage with and listen to the views of colleagues through interactive sessions. More information on the Board's engagement with the workforce can be found on page 162 in the Directors' Report.\n\nExternally, our Glassdoor rating (out of five) has increased from 3.7 in 2019 to 3.9 in 2022, and 79 per cent would recommend working with us to friends. We also continue to be recognised as an employer of choice, in 2022, we ranked as one of the World's Best Employers in Forbes for the second time; ranked as a Diversity Leader for the third consecutive year in the Financial Times report on Diversity and Inclusion in Europe; ranked for the second time within the Top 100 organisations in the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index; and were also recognised in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the seventh consecutive year.\n\nAll of this is indicative of our progress in further strengthening our employee value proposition to attract, retain and grow the skills and talent that are critical to delivering our strategy and outcomes for clients.\n\n## Group KPI: Employee engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Employee net promoter score (eNPS)   |          |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| +4.1 %                               |          |\n| 2022                                 | 1 7. 5 5 |\n| 2021                                 | 12.94    |\n| 2020                                 | 1 7. 5 1 |\n| 2019                                 | 11.51    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neNPS measures the number of promoters (who would recommend the Group as a great place to work) compared with detractors on a scale from -100 to +100.

We are mindful that the levels of stress felt by employees increased in the 2022 My Voice survey from previous years. At the same time, the survey data also indicated that they felt more supported on their wellbeing needs, especially around their mental and physical health. Globally, we offer colleagues access to a mental health app, a physical wellbeing online platform, an employee assistance programme, wellbeing toolkits, learning programmes on resilience as well as an expanding network of trained Mental Health First Aiders. We also continue to aim to mitigate the causes of work-related stress, encourage focus on supportive behaviours within existing processes and decision-making, and seek to insert wellbeing skills-building across learning interventions.\n\n## Adapting to a hybrid world of work\n\n2022 saw renewed optimism as pandemic-related restrictions eased in many of our markets, creating opportunities for employees to increasingly engage with clients, colleagues and communities in person. We continue to implement the flexi-working model that we initiated in 2021, combining flexibility in working patterns and locations. The model has now been rolled out in 43 of our markets, with 78 per cent of employees in these markets on agreed flexi-working arrangements. This has been a significant step towards building on the positive lessons learnt from the pandemic around productivity and employee experience. Our model is enabling us to be more inclusive of the diverse needs of our workforce and support their wellbeing and at the same time consciously balance individual choice and flexibility with business priorities and client needs. Hybrid workers have expressed greater satisfaction with overall employee experience and work-life balance in the 2022 My Voice survey in comparison to employees working fully remotely or fully in the office.\n\nAs employees have started to experience their agreed hybrid working arrangements with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, they have also been required to explore and adopt ways of working in a 'new normal' that balances the benefits of remote working with face-to-face interactions.\n\n## Building leaders that Aspire, Inspire and Execute\n\nExceptional performance requires exceptional leadership. With inputs from our colleagues, we have captured in our Leadership Agreement what we believe it takes to lead at Standard Chartered. We are asking each colleague to Aspire, Inspire and Execute to take us from where we are today to where we have committed to be, and to deliver on our Purpose. In 2022, over 7,900 colleagues have voluntarily signed up to this agreement. We are embedding this standard of leadership into how we induct, develop, measure and recognise our leaders.\n\nToolkits and guidance have been provided to individuals and leaders to help navigate hybrid working, including support on how to organise team and individual work in ways that maximise productivity and wellbeing; on leading in key moments such as onboarding new team members, returning from parental leave and during performance conversations; and on recreating 'water cooler' moments in hybrid work environments. We continue to re-imagine our physical workspaces with the relevant infrastructure and technology to provide hubs for teamwork, collaboration and learning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to hybrid working at sc.com/hybridworking\n\n## Strengthening our culture of high-performance\n\nAs the Group transforms to achieve our strategic ambitions, we have refreshed the way we manage, recognise and reward performance (launched as myPerformance in 2022). We aim to build a strong culture of ambition, action and accountability by focusing on continuous feedback, coaching, and balanced two-way performance and development conversations. As we place even greater emphasis on recognising outperformance that is driven by collaboration and innovation, and encourage more flexibility and aspiration during goal-setting, we have removed individual performance ratings for all employees.\n\nBehavioural changes are already visible and we will further embed the cultural shift through a multi-year journey. In 2022, over 291,000 pieces of feedback were exchanged among colleagues (which is 1.5 times the amount of feedback that was exchanged in the previous year). More than half of our people leaders received feedback from their direct reports, through our 'always on' feedback tool available to all colleagues as well as through the 360-degree feedback tool that has been launched for mid-to-senior people leaders. We believe that the increase in upward feedback indicates a greater sense of psychological safety in the organisation. The feedback is also providing useful input for further building leadership capabilities across the Group.\n\nStrengthening leadership capability, specifically in our people leaders who are most directly responsible for the development of their teams, is a key enabler of our performance and culture. People leaders stepped up throughout the pandemic and we saw manager NPS continue to increase to 33.07 in 2022 (+ 3.35 points year-on-year). As the expectations that employees have of their people leaders continue to grow and evolve, we are also re-imagining how we embed leadership deep into the organisation. Our Leadership Agreement forms the foundation for a modernised leadership development offering that all people leaders will complete over the next three years. We are also encouraging leadership capability building across all employees through the Leadership Academy on our online learning platform diSCover, during our annual Global Learning Week, and through a 60-day Leadership Health journey of regular micro-learning activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our Leadership Agreement at sc.com/leadershipagreement",

We are building a culture of continuous learning that empowers employees to grow and follow their aspirations. We are helping them to build the skills needed for high performance today, to reskill and upskill for tomorrow and to be global citizens who understand the changing nature of the world in which we operate. Since 2020, the average hours invested by employees in personal development has increased by 23.8 per cent to 26.8 hours in 2022.\n\nWe have continued to balance learning in classrooms with learning through our online learning platform diSCover, which is also accessible via a mobile app. Over 77,000 colleagues actively used the platform in 2022 and 32,000 colleagues have used one or more of our Future Skills Academies which include the Data & Analytics, Digital, Cyber, Client Advisory, Sustainable Finance and Leadership Academies. Employees also have the opportunity to learn and practise new skills on the job through projects (often cross-functional and cross-location) and mentoring made available through our AI-enabled Talent MarketPlace platform. Since the launch of the platform, employees have signed up for over 1,200 projects, unlocking close to $4 million in terms of productivity.\n\nWe have further scaled the design and deployment of targeted upskilling and reskilling programmes directed towards critical 'future' roles where our strategic workforce planning analysis has predicted the increasing need for talent, including universal bankers, data translators, cloud security engineers and cyber security analysts. This approach has united our recruitment, talent management and learning efforts to target, upskill and deploy employees into new roles. We are strengthening and scaling our work on sustainability, innovation, performance, digital and leadership skills-building, both across and within roles.\n\n## Building a disability confident organisation\n\nRemoving barriers and increasing accessibility have been key focus areas. We build on the results from our internal Disability Confident Assessment, conducted in more than 40 markets to date, to take directed action. We continue to enhance the accessibility of our technology, including providing sign language functionality in e-learning programmes.\n\nOur continued partnership with the Purple Tuesday initiative across more than 35 markets is increasing the visibility of role models and careers for those with disabilities. It is also building capabilities to break down myths and stereotypes when engaging with clients and colleagues with disabilities. We're encouraged that, in 2022, a greater number of colleagues disclosed about having a disability and the annual My Voice survey highlighted improvements in their experience.\n\n## Creating an inclusive workplace\n\nWe believe that inclusion is how we will enable our diverse talent to truly deliver impact. Our progress in this space is reflected in our annual My Voice survey, where 83.1 per cent of employees reported positive sentiments around our culture of inclusion, which is higher than last year. This has been enabled by increasing awareness around diversity and inclusion principles, unconscious bias and micro behaviours as well as emphasising the importance of creating an inclusive environment - aspects that are covered in the 'When we're all included' learning programme which had been completed by over 28,000 colleagues by the end of 2022.\n\nColleagues are also encouraged to join employee resource groups aligned to shared characteristics or life experiences (including gender, ethnicity and nationality, generations, sexual orientation, and disability). ERGs across our markets provide additional learning, development and networking opportunities, especially for underrepresented populations, and are a valuable source for better understanding the lived experience of our workforce. This has already resulted in improvement through actions - such as the expansion of more accessible and assistive technology to support better access to necessary tools for work, the launch of our SC Pride Charter to cultivate a respectful and safe work environment, and the release of an inclusive language guide to promote psychological safety and review business terms to be more inclusive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read our inclusive language guide at sc.com/inclusivelanguageguide\n\nOur gender diversity continues to grow with more women leaders moving up to senior roles. Women currently represent 43 per cent of the Board, 16 of our CEOs are women, and representation of women in senior leadership roles increased to 32.1 per cent at the end of 2022. We are committed to continuous improvement in this area and aspire to have 35 per cent representation of women at a senior level by 2025. This aspiration is further supported by programmes such as our IGNITE Coaching programme, which develops our women talent in preparation for future roles.\n\nWe remain focused on building a workforce that is truly representative of our client base and footprint. As of 2022, 21 per cent of our Board identifies as being from a minority ethnic background, and we have committed to the aspiration of reaching a minimum of 30 per cent. Further, 22.9 per cent of our Global Management Team and their direct reports identify as Black, Asian or minority ethnic. In the United Kingdom, Black representation in senior leadership is 2.5 per cent and Black, Asian and minority ethnic in senior leadership is 18.1 per cent. In the United States, Black/African American representation in senior leadership is 3.1 per cent and Hispanic/Latinx in senior leadership is 9.4 per cent. We continue to develop strategic partnerships and extend our Futuremakers RISE programme to increase the diversity of our talent pipelines. As we work towards achieving our 2025 UK and US ethnicity senior leadership aspirations, we are also focusing on nurturing local talent in markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We provide employees, where legally permissible, the ability to self-identify ethnicity data through our online systems, and are increasing awareness on",

As we encourage and expect increased participation and selfdeclaration of ethnicity, we aim for it to provide additional insights towards building an even more representative workforce.\n\nWe recognise six key D&I dates* across the year and use these as focal points to facilitate open dialogue on inclusion internally and externally. Through these global campaigns we engage and strengthen relationships with clients and external stakeholders, collectively raising awareness, promoting best practices and committing to take practical steps to advance the D&I agenda in the community.\n\n- * International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, International Men's Day, International Women's Day, and World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, World Mental Health Day\n\n## Equal pay - Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gaps\n\nTo better understand the strengths and gaps of the organisation, and develop action plans to tap into the potential of a truly diverse and inclusive workforce, we have been analysing and publishing our gender pay gap statistics for our five hub locations (UK, US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE). The gender pay gap is calculated based on the approach by the UK government and compares the average pay of men and women without accounting for some of the key factors which influence pay, including different roles, skills, seniority and market pay rates.\n\nCompared with last year, our mean bonus pay gaps have decreased in every market while our mean hourly pay gaps have remained mostly flat, with reductions seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and UAE. While our gender pay gaps have steadily improved since our first disclosure for 2017, they remain at a level that signifies proportionally more male than female colleagues in senior roles and/or roles with higher market rates of pay.\n\nTo complement the legislative approach in the UK, we also calculate an adjusted pay gap, which compares women and men at the same hierarchy level and in the same business area. Mirroring previous years, the narrow margins for the adjusted pay gap analysis indicate that our female and male colleagues in the same business areas and at the same levels of seniority are paid similarly. Equal pay is a key commitment in our Fair Pay Charter and we carry out checks during hiring, promotion and year-end review in all markets to challenge potential bias and ensure there is equal pay for equal work.\n\nIn addition to the gender pay gap analysis, this year we have also prepared for the first time an ethnicity pay disclosure for the UK and the US. These two markets are our regional hubs where we have set ethnicity targets for senior management representation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of our ethnicity pay and gender pay analysis can be found in our Fair Pay Report at sc.com/fairpayreport\n\n| 2022 Gender pay gap   | UK   | Hong Kong   | Singapore   | UAE   | US   |\n|-----------------------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Mean hourly pay gap 1 | 29%  | 20%         | 30%         | 30%   | 25%  |\n| Mean bonus pay gap 2  | 49%  | 39%         | 41%         | 57%   | 44%  |\n\n- 1 The hourly pay gap is calculated by taking the difference between the mean female and male hourly pay, expressed as a percentage of the male amount\n- 2 The Bonus pay gap is calculated by taking the difference between the mean female and male bonus payments received in the 12 months prior to 5 April, expressed as a percentage of the male amount",

For FY23, we plan to disclose our Scope 3 financed emissions for four additional sectors. Beyond that, we aim to incrementally improve the portfolio coverage as market data on emissions becomes more widely available. Further information is available on pages 76 to 83.

        "page_content": "## Creating our inaugural Chief Sustainability Office\n\nAchieving economic, social and environmental sustainability is one of the greatest challenges of our generation and a priority for the Group. In 1987, the United Nations Brundtland Commission defined sustainability as 'meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' . Here at Standard Chartered we are considering what sustainability means to us, and how it can be translated into implementable investments and actions across the Group.\n\nOur Purpose is to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity. Through our valued behaviours to never settle, be better together, and do the right thing, we intend to truly live our brand promise to be here for good.\n\nHowever, there are a number of global challenges ahead. We are faced with worsening climate impacts, stark inequality, and unfair aspects of globalisation. Nowhere is this felt more keenly than in our core markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nWe are taking a stand to combat these challenges and setting long-term ambitions to help address the most pressing issues we face today when seeking to deliver sustainable social and economic development across our business, operations and communities. In 2021, we formally recognised Sustainability as a core component of our strategy, elevating it to a pillar of our Group Strategy (see page 23). In July 2022, we took this a step further and appointed Marisa Drew as our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), to help drive our sustainability agenda and bring together our existing Sustainable Finance, Net Zero Programme Management and Sustainability Strategy Teams. The dedicated CSO office harmonises our existing efforts in sustainability and is responsible for creating and executing the Group-wide sustainability strategy, including delivery against our net zero pathway. With a presence in parts of the world where sustainable finance can have the greatest impact, and a wealth of experience across the Sustainable Finance (SF) and Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) teams, our CSO office is well placed to support our clients in their transition to net zero, mobilise capital at scale and help develop solutions.\n\nWe want to help make the world a better, cleaner and safer place. We also want to contribute towards facilitating a just transition - one where climate objectives are met without depriving emerging markets of their opportunity to grow and prosper.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our sustainability governance see pages 113 to 116 .\n\n## Measuring what matters most understanding our materiality\n\nSince 2016, our approach to striving towards a sustainable and responsible business has been underpinned by our suite of Sustainability Aspirations. These set out how we aim to promote social and economic development and deliver sustainable outcomes in the areas in which we believe we can make the most material contribution to the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). We measure progress against the targets set out in our Sustainability Aspirations and incorporate selected Aspirations into the Group Scorecard to ensure consistent measurement, drive widespread awareness and subsequently support delivery. As a signatory of the UN Principles of Responsible Banking (PRB), we utilise the guidance and tools provided as an input to validating the areas of our greatest impact.\n\n'Materiality' is considered to be the threshold for significance of reporting ESG issues for users of financial statements: investors and other stakeholders. We take into consideration the guidance as provided by the IFRS Foundation Standards, understanding that material issues are those which could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of those users. We also note that materiality for ESG considers both quantitative aspects as well as qualitative information, including a regard for sustainable social and economic development. This will evolve over time and we plan to continue to assess our approach and reporting based on relevance to our users.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Each Aspiration contains one or more performance measures. The KPI is the proportion of all measures that have been achieved or are on track to be delivered at the end of the reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further details on each Aspiration can be found between pages 485 and 487 .",

Facilitating a just transition - one where climate objectives are met without depriving developing countries of their opportunity to grow and prosper - will require care, capital and specialised support.\n\nWe are well placed to help by directing capital to emerging markets that have both the greatest opportunity to adopt low-carbon technology and some of the toughest transition financing and climate challenges.\n\nIn recognition of the important role we can play in the transition, and in line with our Stand to Accelerate Zero, in October 2021, we announced our plan to reach net zero across our operations, supply chain and financed emissions by 2050, as well as our plan to set ambitious interim targets to substantially reduce our financed emissions by 2030. As a UK headquartered bank, our pathway takes into consideration the UK's commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce GHG emissions by at least 100 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, and to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030. However, we are applying these targets and ambitions across our global footprint, despite a number of our footprint markets not having a commitment in place to reach net zero within this timeline at the time of our net zero pathway publication in October 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, our Board sought an ordinary resolution on our net zero pathway at our Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee sc.com/netzerowhitepaper for more information.\n\n## Principal Board decision - Shareholder advisory vote on net zero pathway\n\nIn October 2021, we announced our plan to reach net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and proposed this as a shareholder advisory resolution at the Standard Chartered PLC's (the Company) 2022 AGM. Market Forces and Friends Provident Foundation filed a resolution outlining a different climate approach. Notwithstanding the fact that all parties are highly committed to contributing to the transition to net zero, the Board unanimously recommended that shareholders vote for our advisory resolution and against the requisitioned resolution,\n\nconsidering this to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Board reviewed the pathway before its publication and supported the Group's strategic approach.\n\nIn advance of the AGM and as part of the Board's process, the Group undertook extensive engagement with investors, proxy voting agencies, NGOs and other stakeholders to gather feedback on our net zero pathway. A summary of feedback was provided to the Board once these engagements had concluded and was carefully reviewed. Engagement included:\n\n- \u00b7 Engagement facilitated by Investor Forum, a not-for-profit investor-funded engagement platform, with investors to understand their perspectives on our net zero pathway.\n- \u00b7 Bilateral engagement by the Group, led by the Group Chairman and relevant Board members, with investors and proxy voting agencies to exchange perspectives on our net zero pathway.\n- \u00b7 A roundtable hosted by Investor Forum, and with participation of the Group Chairman to gather further feedback on the Group's net zero pathway.\n- \u00b7 Bilateral engagement, which included the Group Chairman, with Market Forces and Friends Provident Foundation to exchange perspectives on the transition to net zero. Although we sought to reconcile our perspectives in one joint resolution, we were ultimately unable to do so.\n- \u00b7 Commissioning a market research firm to interview leaders from NGOs, academia, business and specialty research institutes from seven countries to analyse how our net zero pathway aligns against external expectations.\n\nIn line with the Board's recommendation, the advisory resolution was endorsed with 83 per cent of shareholder support at the 2022 AGM, and the requisitioned resolution did not pass. The Board is aware that the transition to net zero is an ongoing process that requires continued review and challenge to assess its appropriateness. The Board oversees the Group's sustainability strategy with input from the Culture and Sustainability Committee. It is regularly apprised of the progress we are making against the ambitions in the net zero pathway and continues to be actively involved.",

In 2021, we enhanced this ambition, setting out targets to achieve net zero in our operations by 2025.\n\nOur approach is simple. We intend to optimise our office and branch network, retiring unused and ineffective space to retain a working environment in line with modern requirements for home- and hybrid-working solutions.\n\nIn partnership with our long-term strategic real estate suppliers such as CBRE and JLL, we are working to maximise efficiency while leveraging clean and renewable power where appropriate, in line with our commitment to the global corporate renewable energy initiative, RE100, and to help us meet our own challenging targets.\n\nDespite only a 5 per cent reduction in our measured real estate, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 42 per cent to 49,434 tonnes during 2022. This has been possible through a consumption reduction of 3 per cent to 177.3 GWh through energy-efficient investment, plus a 12 per cent increase in renewable energy (being through direct power purchase agreements, green utilities and renewable energy certificates) and across the portfolio.\n\nWhile new ways of working have led to a direct reduction in our property requirements and associated emissions, we recognise that these emissions have simply been shifted. Throughout 2022, we have begun measuring additional categories of Scope 3 emissions including waste, employee commuting and downstream leased assets. See page 75.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead the principles and methodology for measuring our environment data at sc.com/environmentcriteria\n\n- For further details on our environmental performance see page 489 and our ESG data pack at sc.com/esgdatapack\n\nRead the independent environmental assurance at\n\n- sc.com/environmentalassurance\n\nWe are also committed to reducing waste. In 2022, we reduced our overall waste by 37 per cent, and our waste per employee by 39 per cent to 19.2kg, achieving our target to reduce waste to 40kg per employee per year three years ahead of schedule. This was primarily due to new ways of working reducing employee presence in our buildings.\n\n## [[ Improving our office efficiency]]\n\nWe have created a rolling asset replacement strategy for lighting in our offices. We now aim to only install LED and circadian lighting, and any new fit-out or project, small churn-related changes or upgrades always include improved lighting.",

Although we did not face any issues sourcing potable water in 2022, we continue to take a responsible approach to managing water across the Group.\n\nWe continue to work towards our target to recycle 90 per cent of our waste by 2025. We have commenced the True Zero Waste programme across our top 20 buildings by size and expect to see the first results next year.\n\nDuring 2023, we will continue to accelerate our True Zero Waste certification programme across more offices. This certifies 90 per cent of waste diverted from landfill or incineration and will require further investment and education in waste management and avoidance. Additionally, we will certify more single-use-plastic free buildings and promote more sustainable practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our suppliers -\n\nreducing Scope 3 upstream\n\nWith approximately 11,700 suppliers, we recognise our contribution to climate impacts through the goods and services we procure and understand that severe weather events could result in material disruptions to our supply chain that may potentially impact our ability to serve our clients.\n\nFrom 1 April 2022 all new and renewing material third-party corporate services arrangements in-scope for Business Continuity Management controls are subject to climate risk assessment as part of third-party continuity plans.\n\nThrough our Supplier Charter, we encourage our suppliers to support and promote standards in environmental protection and to manage and mitigate environmental risks.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to make progress against our supply chain sustainability agenda. We saw an approximately 58 per cent decrease in our flight emissions in the period from October 2021 to September 2022, against our target to achieve and maintain flight emissions at 28 per cent lower than our October 2018 to September 2019 baseline, and continued to offset these.\n\nIn partnership with an independent climate consultancy, we continued improving the accuracy of our methodology and estimated our supplier emissions. Due to a limited number of suppliers able to report emission figures to the Group, our methodology relies primarily on emission factors combined with an increasing volume of data reported by suppliers via the CDP climate change survey and emission figures reported by suppliers to the Group. We expect that both supplier emission calculations and our methodology will continue to evolve over time. Using these insights, we identified and engaged our key highest-emitting suppliers to better understand and align on sustainability actions, metrics and goals.\n\nThe process for Scope 3 upstream supplier emissions measurement has been developed and embedded into our wider annual reporting process, with emissions provided for Purchased goods and services, Capital Goods, Upstream transport and Other Business Travel. These emissions are based on the previous year's actual spend, hence a one year time lag: 2022 emissions relate to 2021 expenditure.\n\nFurthermore, we launched a global project to define strategies to address emissions related to Scope 3 Categories 1 (Purchased goods and services), 2 (Capital goods), 4 (Upstream transportation and distribution) and 6 (Business travel). Our targets cover reducing our emissions related to Upstream transportation and distribution and Business travel by 28 per cent against 2019 levels by 2023.\n\nSimultaneously, for Purchased goods and services and Capital goods categories, we plan to engage our suppliers (covering circa 67 per cent of spend) to set science-based targets in the next five years.\n\nIn 2022, to build internal understanding of our supply chain sustainability aspirations and drive united engagement for our net zero goals, we delivered training and awareness sessions which were attended by approximately 450 participants from across the organisation.\n\n| Scope of emissions                                             | 2022 (tCO 2 e)   | 2021 (tCO 2 e)   | 2020 (tCO 2 e)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Scope 1  direct  emissions (combustion of fuel)                | 2,071            | 2,902            | 3,988            |\n| Scope 2  energy  indirect emissions (purchase of  electricity) | 47, 363          | 82,761           | 113,870          |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 1                                          | 49,434           | 85,662           | 117,858          |\n| Scope 3  other indirect  emissions                             |                  |                  |                  |\n| Purchased goods  and services (other) 2                        | 380,732          | 330,244          | -                |\n| Purchased goods  and services (global  data centres) 3         | 706              | 43,132           | 29,562           |\n| Capital goods 2                                                | 34,496           | 47, 2 1 7        | -                |\n| Upstream  transportation and  distribution 2                   | 20,300           | 20,949           | -                |\n| Waste generated  in operations 4                               | 498              | -                | -                |\n| Business travel  (air travel)                                  | 39,107           | 3,654            | 33,930           |\n| Business travel  (miscellaneous  other than flights) 2         | 2,654            | 4,994            | -                |\n| Employee  commuting 3                                          | 61,917           | -                | -                |\n| Downstream leased  assets (corporate  real estate) 4           | 8,594            | -                | -                |\n| Downstream leased  assets (leased  4                           | 1,671,867        | -                |                  |\n| aircraft) Investments 2, 5                                     | 58,500,000       | 45,200,000       | - -              |\n| Total Scope 3  emissions                                       | 60,720,871       | 45,650,190       | 63,492           |\n| Total emissions                                                |                  | 45,735,852       |                  |\n|                                                                | 60,770,305       |                  | 181,350          |\n\n- 4  Emissions for Category 5: Waste generated in operations, Category 7: Employee Commuting and Category 13: Downstream Leased Assets was measured and reported for the first time in 2022.\n- 5 These are financed emissions of our CCIB lending portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on our Scope 3 vendor emissions see our ESG data pack at sc.com/esgdatapack\n\nRead our Supplier Charter at sc.com/suppliercharter",

We aim to become net zero in our financed emissions by 2050, with interim 2030 targets for our highest-emitting sectors.\n\nIn 2022, we made progress towards this goal, and set out to measure, manage and reduce operational and financed emissions via the implementation of our net zero pathway. In 2021, we announced that we expect all clients (beginning with those in high-carbon sectors) to have a strategy to transition to a low-carbon business model. Since then, we have focused on assessing clients in sectors where we have set 2030 net zero targets (Oil and gas, Metals and mining and Power). We have also developed an initial methodology for assessing the credibility of client transition plans. We expect this area to evolve, and will look to adapt our methodology accordingly.\n\nOur methodology draws on information gathered from our client Climate Risk Assessments (see page 88) and considers the guidance on Credible Transition Plans by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the UK's Transition Plan Taskforce. In 2022, we tracked the existence of a transition plan for our corporate clients, and by the end of 2023 intend to have a view of credibility of those transition plans for our largest exposures. We acknowledge that targeting net zero will not be a linear pathway, especially for a bank which operates primarily in the emerging markets and recognises its role in helping to support a just transition. As such, in the shorter term, our financed emissions may increase as we focus on funding our clients' transition journeys toward reaching net zero emissions.\n\n## [[ Standard Chartered joins PCAF]]\n\nDuring 2022 the Group joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Joining PCAF will help us to take a consistent approach to assessing and reporting emissions for its financed and facilitated transactions.\n\nPCAF is a global partnership of financial institutions to develop and implement a harmonised approach for assessing and disclosing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their loans and investments and is becoming the market standard approach.\n\nPCAF has developed GHG accounting methodologies that can be applied by financial institutions who have exposure to listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, project finance, mortgages, commercial real estate and motor vehicle loans. PCAF currently represents financial institutions with total financial assets in lending and investments in excess of $40 trillion dollars.\n\n## Calculating financed emissions\n\nPCAF define financed emissions as the GHG emissions from loans and investments provided by financial institutions to their clients i.e. the proportion of our clients' emissions we finance. To calculate our baseline projections, we measure three types of financed emissions using three methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue-based carbon intensity: a measurement of the quantity of GHG emitted by our clients per USD of their revenue.\n- \u00b7 Absolute financed emissions: a measurement of our attributed share of clients' GHG emissions.\n- \u00b7 Production-based intensity: a measurement of the quantity of GHG emitted by our clients per USD of their production capacity.\n\nOur methodology is based on global standards, including those set by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and PCAF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Revenue  based   =                | Client exposure Client EVIC x                    | Client   emissions )   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| intensity                         | Client exposure Client EVIC Client   revenues x  | )                      |\n| Absolute   financed  emissions =  | Client exposure Client EVIC Client   emissions x | )                      |\n|                                   | Client exposure Client EVIC Client   emissions x | )                      |\n| Production-   based   intensity = | Client per unit of production                    | )                      |\n\nEVIC stands for economic value including cash and is the sum of the client's debt plus equity. If the client is listed, that equity is the client's market capitalisation. The numerical value of the clients EVIC will impact the measurement of all three financed emission methodologies. If, for example, the market capitalisation of a listed client increases (through the client's share price increasing), the financed emissions will decrease on an absolute financed emission, revenue based intensity and production based intensity basis.\n\nFurther, for revenue based intensity, when client revenues increase (for example, commodity based clients experiencing higher commodity prices) the revenue based emissions intensity will decrease.\n\nIt is noted that there is a one-year lag on data used for financed emissions. This is a result of the time taken for our clients to report their financial and carbon emission information. Therefore, the Group's baseline as released in 2021 utilised the 2020 year-end balance sheet date for client exposures, financial and carbon information, and the 2022 updated financed emissions utilises the 2021 year-end balances. We still refer to these as the 2022 and 2021 updates.",

Our first baseline emissions measured 45.2 MtCO 2 e (covering 77 per cent of the CCIB exposure portfolio for which the Group could source financial information), and set out our approach to achieve emissions reduction by 2030 in our most carbon-intensive sectors of:\n\n- \u00b7 63 per cent in Power (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity)\n- \u00b7 33 per cent in Steel (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity)\n- \u00b7 33 per cent in Other metals and mining (ex. Coal Mining) (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity)\n- \u00b7 30 per cent in Oil and Gas (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 intensity)\n- \u00b7 85 per cent in Coal Mining (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 absolute)\n\n## Percentage of financed emissions covered %\n\n## Included in analysis\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024 and later\n\n## Emissions coverage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompleted\n\nNot completed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following section sets out our progress made against these targets during 2022, and builds on this foundation with the announcement of three further sectoral baselines and targets being Automobile Manufacturers, Aviation, and Shipping. With the addition of these further three sectors, we have set targets for eight sectors in total. The emissions of the CCIB lending book across all counterparties in all sectors is estimated to be 58.5MtCO 2 e. These total emissions are where the Group is able to obtain client financial information, being the clients' EVIC. In 2022, the Group was able to source client data for 87 per cent of the CCIB lending portfolio to calculate the 58.5MtCO 2 e. Of these emissions, 61 per cent is due to the emissions of the counterparties in the eight high-carbon sectors for which the Group has set targets. These eight sectors represent 14.4 per cent of the CCIB lending book as of 30 September 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we plan to add a further four sectors into our analysis, and beyond that to incrementally improve the portfolio coverage as market data on emissions becomes more widely available. Analysing our exposure to high-carbon sectors (i.e. sectors that are responsible for the majority of the GHG emissions in the atmosphere) is the starting point of our financed emission calculations. In order to identify which of our lending is to high-carbon sectors, we use the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) sector categorisation, namely: energy; transportation; materials and buildings; and agriculture, food and forest products. The most material sub-sectors to the Group for which baselined targets have been set are presented below.",

Green and other sustainable finance loans which support the transition to the net zero economy are also included. The full exposure does not provide an indication of how many clients have net zero pathways in alignment with our own, and hence can be banked through the transition of their businesses from a higher-carbon present to a lower-carbon future. As reporting efforts harmonise around green, sustainable and transition taxonomies, we will evolve our reporting accordingly.\n\n## Loans and advances and undrawn balances to high-carbon sectors \u00b2\n\n|               |                          | Loans and advances   (drawn funding)   | Loans and advances   (drawn funding)   | Undrawn commitments   and financial guarantees   $m 1 3   |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sector        | Sector                   | 2022 1                                 | 2021 3                                 | 2022                                                      |\n|               | Automotive manufacturers | 3,439                                  | 3,168                                  | 3,036                                                     |\n|               | Aviation                 | 2,497                                  | 2,846                                  | 1,276                                                     |\n|               | Coal mining              | 69                                     | 133                                    | 8                                                         |\n|               | Steel                    | 1,681                                  | 1,838                                  | 1,007                                                     |\n|               | Other Metals and mining  | 2,847                                  | 2,021                                  | 3,237                                                     |\n|               | Oil and gas              | 6,641                                  | 7, 07 7                                | 13,926                                                    |\n|               | Power                    | 4,918                                  | 4,916                                  | 3,843                                                     |\n|               | Shipping                 | 5,456                                  | 5,596                                  | 1,510                                                     |\n| Total balance | Total balance            | 27, 5 4 8                              | 27, 595                                | 27,843                                                    |\n\n## Maturity and expected credit losses of exposure to high-carbon sectors\u00b2\n\n|               |                          | 2022 1 $m                             | Maturity buckets   | Maturity buckets         | Maturity buckets   |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| Sector        | Sector                   | Loans and  advances   (drawn funding) | Less than   1 year | More than 1   to 5 years | More than  5 years |\n|               | Automotive manufacturers | 3,439                                 | 2,855              | 534                      | 50                 |\n|               | Aviation                 | 2,497                                 | 120                | 916                      | 1,461              |\n|               | Coal mining              | 69                                    | 5                  | 31                       | 32                 |\n|               | Steel                    | 1,681                                 | 1,456              | 216                      | 8                  |\n|               | Other Metals and mining  | 2,847                                 | 2,330              | 312                      | 205                |\n|               | Oil and gas              | 6,641                                 | 2,506              | 2,203                    | 1,931              |\n|               | Power                    | 4,918                                 | 1,495              | 1,434                    | 1,988              |\n|               | Shipping                 | 5,456                                 | 801                | 2,988                    | 1,668              |\n| Total balance | Total balance            | 27, 5 4 8                             | 11,567             | 8,635                    | 7, 3 4 4           |\n\nAutomotive manufacturers (Manufacture of motor vehicles and Motor Finance);

In this instance the assets are ships and how they plot against the International Maritime Organisation curve\n- 5 Sector specific intensity being CO 2 per distance traveled\n- 6  'Other' includes manufacturing, wholesale and retailers, commercial real estate, aluminium and cement sectors\n- 7 The exposure to clients is from the Group's systems, however, the ability to find counterparty EVIC's and carbon disclosed is evolving and currently relies on third party inputs and individual searches for financial information. EVIC information is usually found via external aggregators, internal risk systems and individual financial information searches. For emissions, this is done through external aggregators and where not available; regression analysis and proxy information is used\n- 8  2021 financed emissions are calculated based on 31 December 2020 data\n\n## Standard Chartered Group total\n\nOur total financed emissions in 2022 are 58.5 MtCO 2 e, up from 45.2 MtCO 2 e in 2021. This represents an increase of 29 per cent. This increase is not unexpected and reflects a combination of: sector deep dives, which capture full sector value chain emissions; methodological improvements based on evolving industry best practice; and expanded coverage of our emissions footprint based on increasing data availability. These factors contributing to the 2022 reported group emissions figure are therefore not a reflection of an inherent increase in our clients' underlying emissions footprints. Over time, we will seek to capture and report on emissions reductions versus those attributed to methodology changes and expanded coverage of sector emissions.\n\n- \u00b7  Expansion in scope - prior to conducting our sector deep dives as articulated in our net zero pathway, we took a top-down corporate level approach in calculating the baseline. In particular, for the transport sector, our corporate level approach accounted for only Scope 1 and 2 emissions (e.g. solely the emissions from their direct manufacturing and administrative activities). Through the transport sector deep dives we were able to do a full mapping of the sector value chain from a bottom up perspective, which included the underlying asset level emissions. Therefore, emissions have been counted for each underlying vehicle produced, aircraft flown and ship sailed, in addition to the manufacturing and administrative activities. This significantly increased our baseline emissions in 2022 from 2.7 to 13.9 MtCO 2 e.\n- \u00b7  Increased data coverage - we continue to improve our data coverage. In 2022, our client coverage of financial (EVIC) information increased YoY from 77 per cent to 87 per cent. This increased data availability also increased our baseline emissions.\n- \u00b7  Financial volatility - offsetting the prior two factors, increases in commodity prices increased profitability and resulted in higher share prices in these sectors, both of which increased EVICs, therefore decreasing absolute financed emissions for the Group.\n\nFurther, for revenue emissions intensity (as applicable to the Oil and gas, Power, Steel and Other metals and mining sectors), this increased profitability decreased revenue-based carbon intensity (as the ratio of emissions to revenue earned decreased). In 2023, we will be moving to production-based intensity metrics for these sectors which will reduce the impact of market volatility on our emissions profile.\n\nWe acknowledge that our ambition to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 will not be a linear decreasing pathway given the above factors.\n\n## Individual high-carbon sectors\n\nWe measured progress against our emission targets in three forms: absolute financed emission (Coal mining and a baseline for Oil and gas), revenue-based carbon intensity (Oil and gas, Power and Metals and mining), and productionbased intensity (Auto manufacturers, Aviation and Shipping).\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas has shown movement in revenue-based intensity as well as the absolute financed emission baseline. There was a decrease in absolute emissions, due to increasing EVICs and a portion of the 2021 population (Gas-related ships) moving to the Shipping transport sector.\n- \u00b7 Coal mining exposure decreased to less than $100 million; this is a run-down book with no new coal mining loans made in the year.\n- \u00b7 Steel financed emissions remain widely flat across 20212022, decarbonisation of steel will be a long-term journey with limited short-term impact.\n- \u00b7 Power on an economic intensity basis saw a significant decrease, primarily attributed to macroeconomic factors of increased commodity prices passed onto customers with resulting higher revenues. The Power portfolio does however have approximately 25 per cent of its exposure to renewable energy counterparties, which is also bringing this intensity metric down.\n\nWe continue to refine our approach to measuring production targets. In 2023, noting the shortcoming of economic intensity, these sectors will be measured using production-based intensity metrics (CO 2 per KWh or tonne of steel produced).",

Oil and gas represents the single biggest contributor to our total absolute financed emissions, representing 17 per cent of the total.\n\n## Oil and gas value chain in scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Balance   $bn | 2022 financed  emissions   | Target             | Target type                 |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n|             6.3 | 10.2 MtCO 2 e              | -30%   (2020-2030) | Revenue emission  intensity |\n\n## Progress\n\nIn our net zero whitepaper, we targeted an emissions reduction in the Oil and gas sector of 30 per cent (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 intensity) by 2030.\n\nDuring 2022, we revised the measurement of our Oil and gas sector emissions from a revenue-based carbon intensity to absolute financed emissions. This better reflects the sector emission profile and provides alignment with the emerging consensus of peer banks as to the best way in which to measure and set targets for the sector. This effectively creates a carbon budget which is intended to decrease over time, which further helps meet the expectations of our key stakeholders. Our new absolute baseline is 10.2MtCO 2 e and we will disclose targets for this baseline by the Group's 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn 2022, using the existing intensity target, we achieved an 8 per cent reduction year-on-year. This reduction was primarily due to macroeconomic factors, including an increase in clients' underlying corporate value (EVIC) due to increases in commodity prices linked to the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices. This has resulted in a proportionate reduction in our share of financed emission contributions.\n\n## Calculation methodology/Science-based scenario selected\n\nFor the Oil and gas sector, our calculations are based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero Emission by 2050 (NZE) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS).\n\nIn the NZE scenario, the share of fossil fuels in global energy falls from around 80 per cent in 2020 to 20 per cent in 2050, and the residual usage of fossil fuels by 2050 is primarily related to goods where carbon is embedded (e.g. plastics), or production facilities fitted with CCUS (Carbon capture, utilisation and storage). Any remaining usage of fossil fuels is limited to sectors where low-emissions technology options are scarce. Scope 2 emissions are projected using the power generation emissions pathway. Scope 3 downstream emissions make up around 90 per cent of total emissions in the Oil and gas sector and have been calculated assuming that all fuel is burnt and there is no impact from CCUS.\n\n## Changes in baseline method\n\nFor 2022, we have updated the Oil and gas sector emission measurement from revenue-based carbon intensity to absolute financed emission to better reflect sector emission profile.\n\n## Our portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Balance   $bn | 2022 carbon  intensity   | Target             | Target type                 |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n|               4 | 2.07 KgCO 2 e            | -63%   (2020-2030) | Revenue emission  intensity |\n\n## Progress\n\nWe have set ourselves the target to reduce emissions in the Power Generation sector by 63 per cent (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity) by 2030. In 2022, we achieved a 44 per cent reduction, primarily driven by increases in commodity prices which are passed onto customers by power producers, thereby increasing the revenue earned by the producer.\n\nIncreases in the producer's revenue and EVICs decreases our proportion of financed emissions, both on an absolute and economic intensity basis. Absolute reductions in emissions are therefore primarily because of macroeconomic factors. As a caveat, the Group continues to grow our financing provided to renewable power producers, which now represents approximately 25 per cent of the power portfolio and contributes towards this intensity decrease.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nScope 1 is the most material component of the Power sector's emissions. By contrast, Scope 2 is insignificant and relates to energy used to operate power plants which cannot be isolated from the overall industry electricity consumption. Scope 3 is not included as there is no agreed approach to its quantification in this sector.\n\n## Changes in baseline method\n\nWe intend to update our measurement basis of the power sector from a revenue-based intensity measure to a production-based measure in 2023. We believe this will provide a more accurate measure of our counterparty CO 2 emissions, which will be per unit of power produced (KWh).\n\n## Power Generation\n\nThe Power sector sits at the forefront of the energy transition, with many industries relying on electrification to achieve net zero by 2050. However, this will not be possible without a sufficient supply of low-carbon electricity. The private sector is well-established as the leading source of finance for power generation in most economies around the world.\n\n## Power Generation value chain in scope",

The sector contributes around 12 per cent of global CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2), of which Asia, Africa and the Middle East contribute more than 75 per cent.\n\nOur net zero whitepaper detailed our targets to achieve an emissions reduction of 33 per cent for Steel (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity); 33 per cent for Other Metals and Mining (ex. Coal mining) (Scopes 1 and 2 intensity); and 85 per cent for Coal mining (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 absolute).\n\n## Metals and mining value chain in scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our portfolio\n\n| Sector                    | Balance   $bn   |   2022  financed   emissions | Target   | Target type                  |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|\n| Steel                     | 1.4             |                          1.9 | -33%     | Revenue  emissions intensity |\n| Other  Metals and  Mining | 0.7             |                          0.9 | -33%     | Revenue  emissions intensity |\n| Coal  Mining              | <0.1            |                          2.3 | -85%     | Absolute financed  emission  |\n\n## Progress\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a 30 per cent reduction in the absolute emissions associated with our Coal mining portfolio, from 3.3 to 2.3 MtCO 2 e. This has been achieved by allowing the periodic run-down of our loan book in this sector.\n\nFor Steel and Other Metals and Mining, we achieved a 11 per cent reduction in the revenue intensity target. This decrease was primarily due to increases in commodity prices reducing our proportion of the client's emissions. Price increases resulted in an increase in client revenue which therefore reduced our share of emissions.\n\n## Calculation methodology Mining projections\n\nWe have used a Baringa scenario to calculate Scope 1 emissions from coal mining. The Power sector has been followed for Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions have been based on coal production adapted from the IEA's Net Zero Emissions scenario.\n\n## Steel producer projections\n\nEmissions for the steel sector are often quoted or published in a way that partially includes Scope 2 and/or Scope 3. In our methodology, we differentiate Scope 1 from Scopes 2 and 3 to support clearer, more precise calculations. Scope 3 emissions are not currently calculated due to limited data availability; however, we continue to engage our clients and standard setters to develop a suitable approach to calculating Scope 3 emissions for steel.\n\n## Changes in baseline method\n\nWe intend to update our measurement basis of the Metals and mining sector from revenue-based intensity measures to a production-based measure in 2023. We believe this will provide a more accurate measure of our counterparty CO 2 emissions which will be provided by unit of metal produced (e.g. tonne of steel).\n\n## Thermal coal\n\nWe will only provide financial services to clients who:\n\n## By 2024\n\nare less than 80% dependent on thermal coal (based on % revenue)\n\n## By 2025\n\nare less than 60% dependent on thermal coal (based on % revenue)\n\n## By 2027\n\nare less than 40% dependent on thermal coal (based on % revenue)\n\n## By 2030\n\nare less than 5% dependent on thermal coal (based on % revenue)\n\n## Progress\n\nIn October 2021, we enhanced our Power Generation and Extractive Industries Position Statements to test our clients' dependency on thermal coal at client entity level and at group level (tested at group level previously). Since then, we identified 37 client entities that derive 100% of their revenue from thermal coal. Of these, 14 entities have been fully exited in 2022 with the remainder in progress, subject to contractual commitments.\n\nAll our criteria on thermal coal is tested on an annual basis via our Environmental and Social Risk Assessments. Where a client triggers a threshold but approaches us to provide Transition Finance we will consider our involvement on a case-by-case basis, including instances where a client is reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the early retirement of coal power assets.\n\n## Expanding our financed emissions coverage\n\nIn line with our aim to measure, manage and reduce our financed emissions, in 2022, we continued to expand the coverage of our calculations and are pleased to announce three further sectoral targets covering transportation.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to reduce emissions in the transportation sector:\n\n- \u00b7 34 per cent in Aviation (production intensity)\u00b2\n- \u00b7 Reduce our alignment delta in Shipping from +2.6 per cent to 0 per cent 1\n- \u00b7 49 per cent in Automotive manufacturers (production intensity)\u00b2\n- 1 Alignment with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) emissions trajectory curve\n- 2   Sector specific intensity being CO 2 per Km distance traveled\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is responsible for over 2 per cent of global energy-related CO 2 emissions, as per the IEA Tracking report 2022.\n\nOur 2022 portfolio emissions baseline is 1152 gCO 2 e/Rtk (revenue tonne kilometre). Reaching net zero in this sector will be challenging; however, we believe we can make progress towards net zero by leveraging new fleet technology, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and engaging ambitious counterparties.\n\nWe have set ourselves the target to achieve a 34 per cent reduction in production intensity\u00b2, from our baseline.\n\n## Emission intensity (gCO 2 e/RTK)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nThe emissions are calculated based on Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) Prudence (1.5C scenario) by counting aviation fuel burn by each aircraft to which asset-backed finance has been provided. The calculation uses a well-to-wake formula which includes all emissions from the point of oil extraction to being burnt by the aircraft engines. Therefore, Scopes 1, 2 (for the corporate) and 3 (emissions for each aircraft) are included for each counterparty funded.\n\nFor each aircraft, we receive total km travelled, estimate total fuel burnt on a well-to-wake basis (based on total distance travel and aircraft engine type) and add onto this a load (weight) factor of specific aircraft to calculate Revenue Tonnes per Kilometre.\n\n## Shipping\n\nThe shipping sector consists of moving goods or passengers by water and is responsible for 2.9 per cent of global emissions. 1\n\nOur shipping portfolio has a baseline 'alignment delta' of +2.6 per cent in 2022. Achieving the current International Maritime Organisation (IMO) target of zero delta is feasible and future regulations are likely to drive the industry to net zero. Key levers for the sector include:\n\n- \u00b7 Support transition through investment in retrofit, alternative fuels and greener vessels (e.g. young and dual fuel vessels).\n- \u00b7 Deepen relationships with ambitious counterparties and engage others.\n\n## Alignment delta\n\n(calculated against current IMO trajectory)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-25%\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nShipping emissions are calculated by counting fuel oil burn for each ship to which asset-backed finance has been provided.\n\nEach owner or lessee is required to report to a regulator the distance its ships have travelled during the year, as well as fuel consumed per vessel. Some vessels consume more energy based on their type of cargo.\n\nIMO conversion factors are used to convert fuel burnt to CO 2 emissions, with these emissions divided by distance travelled and Dead Weight Tonnage (the loaded weight of a ship) to provide the gCO 2 e/Vkm (vehicle kilometre).\n\nThe IMO also has a 2050 trajectory. This is not yet 1.5 degree compliant, however the Poseidon Principles, which are shipping specific, requires that banks measure and report their 'alignment delta' and provide a trajectory for each type of vessel in a different weight category to that trajectory.\n\n- 1 IMO, 2020.

It is this opportunity which we are targetting through our low-carbon products and services.\n\nWith our strong emerging markets footprint, we recognise the role we have to play in facilitating a just transition, directing capital and specialised support to the regions that need it most to support sustainable economic growth. More than 90 per cent of our sustainable financing is directed at communities within the Asia, Africa and the Middle East region (see sc.com/SFImpactReport for more detail).\n\nWe have focused on strengthening our capabilities in transition finance throughout 2022, including deploying a dedicated Transition Acceleration Team within the CSO organisation to support clients in high-carbon sectors. This team includes specialists with industry knowledge to advise our clients in their individual sustainable finance journeys.\n\n## We have set ourselves targets to achieve Sustainable Finance income of $1 billion by 2025, and mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance between 2021 and 2030.\n\nWe have set ourselves a target to mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030. This includes the facilitation of green and social bond raising, provision of funding commitments to green and social causes as outlined below, advisory services to support our clients on their own journeys to net zero and facilitation of Sustainability Linked Loans.\n\nIn 2022, we mobilised $23.4 billion through our sustainable financing activities, bringing our cumulative sustainable finance total towards this target to $48 billion since 2021. This target update covers the time period from 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2022.

During the year, these mortgages were reviewed and identified by CPBB as meeting the requirements of the Group's Green and Sustainable Product framework.\n- 5 Business banking; SME and Microfinance lending which is the provision of finance to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) lower- and middle-lower-income countries as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The inclusion of business banking is linked to the Access to Finance sub-theme within the Group's Green and Sustainable Product Framework incorporating Employment generation, and programmes designed to prevent and/or alleviate unemployment, including through the potential effect of SME financing and microfinance. With the inclusion of business banking, the Entrepreneur (Lending to SMEs and Microfinance) aspirations would be double counted and these aspirations have therefore been retired.\n- 6  Capital market bonds are measured by the proportional bookrunner share of facilitated activities as determined by third-party league table rankings based on the level of services provided.\n- 7 M&A/Advisory represents sole financial adviser, measured by the total deal size divided by the number of advisers on the deal.\n- 8  Mobilised $23.4bn of Sustainable Finance is for YTD Sept 2022 and $48bn delivered between 2021-2022 includes full year 2021 and YTD Sept 2022.",

These frameworks, developed in collaboration with Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG and corporate governance research, are reviewed annually.\n\nFollowing the launch of our new Transition Finance Framework in 2021, we updated our Green and Sustainable Product Framework and expanded the list of eligible activities.\n\nIn CCIB, new product launches included Sustainable Fiduciary Deposits, sustainability-linked sale and leaseback for aviation finance, and ESG structured products with rates underlying.\n\nWithin CPBB, we connected retail clients with access to sustainable finance offerings, launching new products including structured notes, sustainable deposits and Green Mortgages. Throughout 2022, we increased the number of markets where we offer Green Mortgages to six, through successful product launches in Vietnam, South Korea and Malaysia.\n\nIn total, we now have 31 sustainable finance products spanning both our CCIB and CPBB client segments. By reviewing the income potential from this growing suite of Sustainable Finance products and services, alongside our client base and the estimated scale of the opportunity, we believe that we are on track towards our target of achieving $1 billion of Sustainable Finance income 1 by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we reported $0.5 billion Sustainable Finance related income against this target, and increased our Sustainable Finance asset base by 45 per cent to $13.5 billion between July 2021 and September 2022. This increase was largely due to the identification and tagging of $3.8 billion in Green Mortgages, primarily within the Hong Kong market.\n\nThe majority of our Sustainable Finance asset base ($10.2 billion of the $13.5 billion) has been extended to a variety of green projects which help lower carbon emissions, such as renewable energy projects, commercial real estate and funding for the development of rail projects.\n\nOur social lending makes up the remaining $3.3 billion of our total Sustainable Finance asset pool and encompasses categories such as healthcare, education and access to finance.\n\n## Our Sustainable Finance Frameworks\n\nOur Green and Sustainable Product Framework governs our Sustainable Deposits products and suite of Sustainable Trade Products, and sets out what qualifies as 'green', 'social' or 'sustainable'.\n\nThe Sustainability Bond Framework governs our debt products, providing transparency and guidance on the use of proceeds and the impact of the green, social and sustainable bonds issued by the Group.\n\nWe have outlined our approach to defining Transition Finance in our Transition Finance Framework 4 . This Framework is informed by the IEA NZE 2050 scenario.\n\n## Sustainable Finance income\n\n| Product 1  ($m)                 |   2022 3,4 |   2021 | YOY 2   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|--------|---------|\n| Transaction Banking             |         80 |     32 | 150%    |\n| Trade & Working capital         |         60 |     25 | 140%    |\n| Cash Management                 |         20 |      7 | 186%    |\n| Financial Markets               |        326 |    241 | 35%     |\n| Macro Trading                   |         54 |     21 | 157%    |\n| Credit Markets                  |        268 |    217 | 24%     |\n| Financing & Securities Services |          4 |      3 | 33%     |\n| Lending & Portfolio Management  |        102 |     88 | 16%     |\n|                                 |        508 |    361 | 41%     |",

        "page_content": "## A shared ambition - working in partnership\n\nWe have identified several opportunities for the Group to play an active role in shaping global standards ranging from net zero to carbon markets. Along these lines, we are actively involved in the leadership of several standard-setting or standard-influencing efforts.\n\nFor instance, we are active participants of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) Principles Group, an ambitious programme to generate the commitment, investment and alignment needed to drive forward the transition to net zero. Together with the CEO of Macquarie Group, our CEO is the Co-Chair of the GFANZ Working Group on Capital Mobilisation to Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, and throughout 2022, our Group Head, Conduct and Financial Crime and Compliance has chaired the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) - the industry-led banking element of GFANZ.\n\nOur Group Chairman has co-chaired the United Nations' Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, which has set ambitious objectives to scale up long-term finance and investment in sustainable development; and our Global Head, Sustainable Finance has continued to hold the position of Chair of the Equator Principles Association. In 2023, we intend to support the Equator Principles Steering Committee as our term as Chair comes to an end. We are also joining the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as a member of the Board of Governors.\n\nIn addition, we are members of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the Climate Bonds Initiative, as well as one of the initial members of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and signatories of the Poseidon Principles, a global framework for assessing and disclosing the climate alignment of financial institutions' shipping portfolios.Our Global Head of Sustainability Strategy and Net Zero represents the Group on SBTi's Financial Net-Zero Expert Advisory Group (EAG).\n\nOur Head of Carbon Markets Development is a Board member of the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (IC-VCM), which is focused on developing a highquality international carbon market. The IC-VCM carried out a consultation on its Core Carbon Principles over the summer, receiving over 350 responses and 5,000 individual comments. Our Group CEO sits on the Distinguished Advisory Group of the IC-VCM and will aim to be involved in the development and trading of carbon markets around the world.\n\nMeanwhile, we increased our representation at COP27 and the G20 and were actively involved in the launch of several groundbreaking initiatives on the margins of each; these include the launch of the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) and Egypt's Nexus for Water, Food & Energy (NWFE) at COP27, the $20 billion commitment to advance Indonesia's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) at the G20, and the $15.5 billion commitment to the Vietnam JETP.\n\nThe Group participates in various industry initiatives, forums and roundtables, including the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) and Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) roundtable, to ensure we benchmark our risk management capabilities and stay abreast of changes.\n\nSimilarly, we are engaged at local and regional levels to share insights, comment on regulatory consultations, and better understand the regulatory landscape and practices across our footprint.\n\n## Investing in Climate Research\n\nOur four-year partnership with Imperial College London covers long-term research on Climate Risk, advisory on shorter-term, internally focused projects to enhance Climate Risk capabilities and training of our colleagues, Management Team and Board.\n\nIn 2022, we sponsored a research project on 'Investing in Nature to Tackle Biodiversity Loss and Enhance Food Security', which explored the risks and opportunities facing the global agricultural sector from climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 Part 1 expanded on the known risks of climate change on the agriculture sector by examining the failings of major climate models, as well as the immediacy of the significant impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector.\n- \u00b7 Part 2 explored the potential for nature-based solutions to tackle the interlinkages between agriculture, land-use, and climate change.\n- \u00b7 Part 3 focused on the financial opportunities surrounding natural assets and sustainable agriculture.\n\nIn addition, we worked with Imperial College London on three advisory projects during 2022, to develop a methodology to assess the impact of Climate Risk on sovereign ratings; develop Physical Risk report cards for sovereigns; and enhance the energy consumption calculation methodology and emission factor database for mortgage portfolios in our key markets.",

But before we can manage the risk, first we must be able to identify, assess its size and monitor it.\n\nIn the front line, our Environmental and Social Risk Management team within the Chief Sustainability Office aims to drive growth while managing the environmental and social (E&S) risks associated with financing related to our CCIB clients. Our approach is embedded directly into our credit approval process and supports us to work with our stakeholders to identify, manage, mitigate and monitor the potential impacts that stem from our financing decisions.\n\nOur Position Statements, approved by the Group Responsibility and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC), outline the standards we apply to assess whether to provide financial services to our clients, and help us to identify and assess E&S risks related to our CCIB clients.\n\nWe use these statements - which draw on International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, the Equator Principles (EP) and global best practice - to assess whether to provide financial services to clients operating in sensitive (including high-carbon) business sectors. In addition, we have specific guidance for clients operating in sectors with a high potential environmental or social impact. Our list of prohibited activities can be found at sc.com/prohibitedactivities .\n\nIn 2022, we reviewed 1,170 clients and 550 transactions that presented potential E&S risks. If we find a material E&S issue, we take steps to proactively engage the client to mitigate identified risks and impacts, and support and guide our clients to improve their E&S performance over time.\n\nIn relation to climate, we encourage all clients in the Power generation, Metals and mining, and Oil and gas sectors to have a strategy to transition their business, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We review a client's approach to transition using the output from our client Climate Risk assessments. In particular, we utilise a client's Transition Risk mitigation score, which considers both quantitative inputs (e.g. emissions measurement data and reduction targets), and qualitative overlays through direct client conversations to assess management focus and commitment.\n\nWe aim to support and guide our clients to a low-carbon pathway and offer them sustainable financing as the main levers to help us achieve our net zero targets. We will also be assessing our exposure to emissions-intensive clients and/or assets and will seek to replace these over time by adding new low-carbon-intensity clients and/or assets to our portfolio.\n\nThis does not mean walking away from our existing clients, but instead working with them to finance investment in low-carbon methods and technologies, particularly across Asia, Africa and the Middle East where investment could have the biggest impact. However, for clients who do not align with our Position Statements, we may look to withdraw financial services and exit the relationship if we cannot work with them to align over time.\n\n## Group Climate Risk Appetite Statement\n\n' The Group aims to measure and manage financial and non-financial risks from climate change, and reduce the emissions related to our own activities and those related to the financing of clients in order to support alignment with the Paris Agreement'\n\nWe recognise how important it is to get this right, so in support of our Sustainability Aspirations, we updated our E&S Risk Management Framework based on our 2021 Position Statement refresh, and we expanded our capacity, establishing a team within our Global Business Service centre in Warsaw to conduct enhanced E&S due diligence on clients. In addition, all relationship managers and credit officers are offered training in assessing E&S risk, as well as having access to detailed online resources. 4,944 colleagues received E&S related training in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we prioritised our approach to biodiversity by undertaking a pilot biodiversity risk assessment. This included a loan book analysis to identify impacts and dependencies from biodiversity-related risks at a sector, country and financial services level. We are continuing to develop our approach to biodiversity, expanding on the review conducted this year to gain a clearer view of the biodiversity risk associated with the Group's activities.\n\nIn 2023, we plan to update our Position Statements covering all sensitive sectors, with the requirements to become effective the following year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our Position Statements at sc.com/positionstatements\n- Read more about our prohibited activities at sc.com/prohibitedactivities\n- Read more about our reporting against the Equator Principles at sc.com/equatorprinciples",

Our Climate Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) is approved annually by the Board, and is supported by Board and Management Team level risk appetite metrics across Credit - CCIB and CPBB, Reputational and Sustainability Risk (RSR), Traded Risk and Country Risk.\n\nThe metrics are approved by the Group Risk Committee (GRC) (for Management Team level risk appetite metrics) and the Board (for Board level risk appetite metrics) annually. Monitoring of adherence to risk appetite metrics commenced in January 2022 and any breaches are reported to the GRC and Board Risk Committee (BRC).\n\nWe are expanding the scope and coverage of our risk appetite metrics for enhanced risk identification and management. Additional metrics to address our public targets across key sectors and a stress loss metric built on scenario outcomes have been identified and are being monitored for inclusion in risk appetite reporting in 2023. The focus for 2023 will be to increase the coverage of existing metrics and introduce new risk appetite metrics.\n\nThe uncertainties surrounding how and when Physical and Transition Risk will impact mean that no tool or methodology is perfectly able to estimate risks from climate change now or in the future. However, we need to move quickly so we are developing methodologies, engaging with clients and integrating Climate Risk into our mainstream risk management activities and assessments. We will seek to adapt our approach as the impact from Climate Risk becomes clearer and the tools and methodologies to gather reliable data mature.\n\nWe have toolkits to quantitatively measure climate-related Physical and Transition Risk and in 2022, we continued to enhance our understanding of climate-related risks, and significantly strengthened our stress testing and scenario analysis capabilities for a range of management scenarios that are more plausible. We continue to engage with our corporate clients to understand their Transition and Physical Risks, as well as their plans to prepare for climate change.\n\nThe data we captured helped us develop our own client-level climate-risk assessments for both existing and new clients, improve our internal climate modelling capabilities and strengthen the risk measurement and monitoring of the portfolios. Despite significantly advancing in these areas, quality and availability of data is a pervasive issue. While we are focusing on improving the data quality, improvements are likely to take several years. In view of the paucity of data and little to no transition or physical risk related historic data for model testing, several assumptions and limitations must be made while building these models. The limitations and challenges continue to exist which are discussed throughout our disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on how we apply scenario analyses and consider time horizons, please see pages 90 to 95.\n\nFor more detail on how we recognise Climate Risk within our ERMF, the risks identified, as well as the processes and toolkits used to do this, see pages 96 to 112 .",

Despite significantly advancing scenario analysis capabilities over the past three years, the modelling of Climate Risk impact over a 30-year period has been expectedly challenging across multiple dimensions, including scenario data and pathways, availability of client-specific data, and modelling limitations.\n\nNotwithstanding these challenges, our work to date, using certain assumptions and proxies, indicates that our business is resilient to all Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios that were explored. For more details on the limitations pertaining to the scenario analysis, please see page 94.\n\nWith the aim to enhance our internal scenario analysis capabilities in line with our Risk Appetite Statement, in 2022 we assessed the impact of Transition Risk on our CCIB corporate client portfolio based on three IEA scenarios and three Phase 2 scenarios from the NGFS, and participated in the Monetary Authority of Singapore Industry-Wide Stress Test. We also assessed the impact of sea-level rises under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios to explore the Physical Risk impact on the Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) residential mortgage portfolio over short- and long-term time horizons for internal risk management purposes.\n\nThe results of these analyses are being used to further inform strategy and business planning, set Risk Appetite, identify portfolios with elevated risk concentration, and establish linkages to enhanced credit risk assessments.\n\nWhile we have continued to use external models to support scenario expansion and modelling of Transition and Physical Risks, in 2022 we built on this foundation and developed internal model-building capabilities supported by an external vendor. The outputs of these models will be used to support IFRS9 impact analysis, stress testing runs and various risk management processes. Our aim is that these internal models will provide greater transparency when compared to vendor models and enable us to run various scenarios and calibrate the models as required. We aim to continuously improve these models throughout 2023 to cater for shorter, more plausible scenarios that can inform our business strategy and financial planning.\n\nThe following section describes the scenarios we use, their inputs, assumptions, limitations and key insights.\n\n## Scenarios used at Standard Chartered\n\n## Transition Risk scenarios\n\nIn 2022, we adapted the following scenarios to our CCIB clients:\n\n## IEA Scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, which sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Development scenario, which specifies a pathway to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable energy by 2030 (SDG 7.1); substantial reduction in air pollution (SDG 3.9) and effective action to combat climate change (SDG 13).\n- \u00b7 Announced Pledges scenario, which assumes that all climate commitments made by governments around the world, including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and longer-term net zero targets, will be met in full and on time.\n\n## NGFS Phase 2 framework:\n\nThis maps scenarios in three different worlds with two scenarios produced under each category:\n\n- \u00b7 'Hot House' world scenarios, also noted as 'No Additional Policies', include only currently implemented or pledged policies, which at a global level are insufficient to halt significant global warming resulting in severe Physical Risk.\n- \u00b7 Orderly scenarios assume climate policies are introduced early and become increasingly stringent, with both physical and transition risks relatively subdued.\n- \u00b7  Disorderly scenarios explore higher Transition Risk due to policies being delayed or being divergent across countries and sectors.\n\nEach of the three IEA and NGFS scenarios are characterised by different levels of Transition Risk, driven by various features in each scenario.",

By contrast, in the NGFS Disorderly Transition scenario, the global carbon price is very low throughout the 2030s, and then rises steeply in line with the extreme decarbonisation effort required in the late 2030s onwards. In the IEA scenarios,\n\nthe global carbon price is significantly lower compared to NGFS scenarios and rises\n\nto ~$100 by 2050 only in the Net Zero Emissions scenario.\n\n## Global carbon price used in the NGFS and IEA scenarios and applied at Standard Chartered\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon prices can vary significantly across regions. In the Middle East and North Africa, and Oceania and Asia Pacific, the trend of carbon prices in an orderly scenario is gradual over the 30-year horizon, peaking at around $650. North America and Europe on the other hand experience a more rapid pick up in carbon prices between 2020 and 2025 to approximately $250, after which they gradually increase to reach a price of just under $900 by 2050.\n\n## Regional carbon price used in the NGFS orderly transition scenario and applied at Standard Chartered\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also considers that population growth and economies expand at different rates.\n\nBoth the NGFS Orderly and NGFS Disorderly Transition scenarios are characterised by a highly decarbonised power sector in 2050 with a significant expansion in renewables. Similarly, IEA Net Zero and IEA Sustainable Development scenarios show significant expansion in renewables.\n\nIn the NGFS 'Hot House' world scenario, renewables are projected to increase to meet the growing demand, while the total hydrocarbon power production remains relatively stable.

We have a plan to close these data gaps, but it is likely to take several years, including periodically working with third parties, use of proxies and engaging clients to gather more information.\n\nThe impact of the scenarios has so far been based on a simplified approach, primarily focusing on the credit risk of the Group's portfolios, static balance sheets and conducted at a counterparty level for CCIB clients and postcode level for Consumer Mortgages. Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) thresholds are not incorporated while estimating credit risk losses for climate scenario analysis.\n\nMany of the assumptions and methodologies that underpin scenario analysis rely significantly on nascent methodologies as well as a dependence on first generation external models and data challenges. Most of these limitations are shared across the industry. Levels of disclosure, climate preparedness and policies to limit emissions are often observed to be less mature in some emerging market regions.\n\nAs more solution providers come to the market and banks start extensively using them to build internal understanding and capabilities, the transparency and sophistication of modelling methodologies and assumptions will likely increase.",

        "page_content": "## Transition and Physical Risk scenario analysis results\n\nModelled results demonstrate the clear benefits of early action to mitigate climate change. 1 The modelled results across the IEA and NGFS scenarios have been carried out for approximately 53 per cent of our corporate portfolio, primarily reflective of the gross transition risks, while client-level transition plans have not been factored into the analysis.\n\nRelatively lower loss estimates in the NGFS 'Hot House' world and the IEA Announced Pledges scenarios reflect the nascent modelling capabilities on assessing Physical Risk impact to client asset locations, and second-order impacts such as on the supply chain. The impact from each of the scenarios on aggregate gross expected credit loss in the NGFS and IEA scenarios is shown in the bubble charts on page 91.\n\nIn comparison to other stress tests conducted across our portfolios, these estimates are relatively muted.\n\nThe result of the IEA Net Zero scenario is more critical, with severe loss projection over a 30-year horizon compared to the other two IEA scenarios. The increase in carbon price, drastic decrease in oil and gas demand and oil price, along with the emergence of a highly decarbonised power sector by 2050 impacts Oil and gas, Commodity traders and the Transportation sectors.\n\nThe IEA Announced Pledges scenario shows the least severe loss projection over a 30-year horizon. The scenario depicts a negligible increase in carbon price and almost no change in oil demand and price by 2050. The combination of these factors results in a moderate loss projection.\n\nThe IEA Sustainable Development scenario depicts a moderate increase in carbon price. Oil demand almost halves and oil price reduces by ~30 per cent over current levels. The combination of these factors results in higher losses for the Oil and gas, Commodity Traders and Automobile sectors.\n\nThe results for the NGFS Orderly Transition scenario are driven by an increase in carbon price and drop in oil and gas demand. The steady increase in carbon price from 2021 to 2050 leads to an overall increase in defaults, driven by the decrease in revenue and profitability levels due to an increase in carbon price related costs.\n\nBy contrast, the NGFS Disorderly Transition scenario sees fast-growing carbon prices after 2030, which impacts company Probability of Defaults (PDs) and leads to an increase in loss projections. The Commodity Traders, Oil and gas and Automobiles sectors are the most impacted in this scenario.\n\nThe concentration of the Group's portfolio exposure for the top eight residential mortgage portfolios exposed to extreme sea-level rise risk was computed using the Munich Re model's outputs. It has been observed to remain stable at 2 per cent for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios and at 1 per cent under the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\n## Developing our capabilities\n\nWe have identified several areas for future development:\n\n- \u00b7 Improved data availability and ability to gather data across our corporate and retail clients (e.g. client-level emission intensity, physical locations of assets, power consumption patterns). Through our client-level climate risk questionnaires (covering approximately 65 per cent of our total corporate exposure in 2022) we gather information on client-level transition plans, including potential client outreach for clients with high Transition Risk and low transition mitigation levels.\n- \u00b7 Continued improvement in scenario design and modelling capabilities, with an established roadmap to develop this capability in-house and build internal models.\n- \u00b7 In line with plans to develop internal modelling capabilities, engage an external vendor and/or partner with our academic adviser (Imperial College London) to design a range of scenarios (e.g. short-term, bespoke scenarios targeted to our portfolios and markets, and consideration of second-order impacts).\n- \u00b7 Despite these limitations, our intention is to focus on how Climate Risk management can inform portfolio management and support opportunity identification with clients on their transition and adaptation pathways.\n\n## Qualitative review of climate risks and opportunities in annual business strategy and financial planning\n\nIn 2022, Climate Risk was considered as part of our formal annual corporate strategy and financial planning process. In addition, we developed management scenarios with an aim of strengthening our business strategy and financial planning to support the Group's net zero journey.\n\nWe use both qualitative and quantitative aspects focusing on revenue reliance from clients in high-carbon sectors and/or locations in regions most exposed to Physical Risk, considering adequacy of mitigation plans. Where applicable, results are then independently reviewed by regional and client-segment Chief Risk Officers (CROs) and the Climate Risk team. Climate Risk impact is also included in the Risk review of our corporate plan, which is considered by the Board as part of their approval of the overall Corporate Plan. The 2023 Corporate Plan includes an increase in loan impairment due to the impact from Climate Risk.\n\nIn most cases, the physical and transition risks identified were assessed to be well controlled in the short term. We are not actively targeting growth in most of the high-carbon sectors and are instead prioritising sustainable finance products to clients in high-carbon sectors to decarbonise their business models. Growth ambition is shifting to lower-carbon sectors such as clean technology. Our sustainable finance priorities, including new emerging products such as sustainable deposits, carbon trading and ESG Advisory, and dedicated transition frameworks, seek to respond to transition risks in the short term, strengthening our resilience towards a 2\u00b0C or lower transition scenario. However, longer-term transition risks were highlighted, particularly for the Africa and Middle East (AME) region, given its dependency on fossil fuels; and longer-term physical risks were deemed to be most relevant for the Asia region.",

In turn, this entails credit losses for lenders and  market losses for investors.                                                  |\n\nClimate Risk is considered an Integrated Risk Type because it manifests though impacted Principal Risk Types (PRTs) or overarching risk types.

We have identified seven PRTs that are most materially impacted by potential climate risks and describes transmission channels for Climate Risk manifesting as financial and non-financial risk.\n\n- \u00b7 Treat Climate Risk like a traditional risk type. Climate Risk may lead to financial losses and non-financial detriments, much like Credit Risk, and should be managed as such to limit the Group's exposure to detriments. This means embedding Climate Risk considerations into our existing risk identification and management processes, governance, reporting, scenario analysis (including stress testing), strategy and financial planning.\n- \u00b7 Recognise and build for where Climate Risk is different. Unlike traditional risk types, Climate Risk is likely to crystallise over much longer time horizons and is inherently difficult to quantify. Its unique features and a need for granular forward-looking measurements require the use and development of new tools and methodologies to quantify and analyse the implications.",

We manage Climate Risk according to the characteristics of these PRTs and are embedding climate-risk considerations into the relevant frameworks and processes\n\nfor each. In 2022, we have continued to build Climate Risk into existing risk-management processes, to enhance our ability to identify, assess and monitor across risk types.\n\nWe continuously look for ways to refine and update our approach as methodologies and learnings emerge, including the expansion of client or product coverage where possible.\n\nThe areas where we have made progress to embed Climate Risk considerations within business and across PRTs are listed below.\n\n## Process to embed Climate Risk considerations\n\n| Principal   Risk Type                           | Framework/ Policies/  Standards   | Risk   Appetite   | Reporting   | Further Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit Risk  - CCIB                             | Y 1 (Effective   July 2022)       | Y                 | Y           | \u00b7  The Climate Risk Standard, effective from 1 July 2022, mandates all new and  existing corporate clients (CG 1-12) with an advised limit greater or equal to  $20m to be assessed for Climate Risk considerations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                 |                                   |                   |             | \u00b7  A new technology solution called the ESG Navigator has been deployed to  assess Climate Risk considerations for all in scope clients since July 2022. \u00b7  Throughout 2022 we have covered ~80 per cent of high Transition Risk sectors  (i.e. Oil and gas, Mining and Power) and ~65 per cent of the Group's total  corporate exposure.  \u00b7                                                                                                                          |\n|                                                 |                                   |                   |             | By 2023, we aim to achieve 80 per cent coverage of the Group's total  corporate exposure and extend Climate Risk-related considerations to  deepen credit underwriting and broaden linkages, account management   and client engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Credit Risk  - CPBB                             | Y                                 | Y                 | Y           | \u00b7  In our progress for 2022, we have expanded Physical Risk assessments to  additional markets within Consumer Mortgage (Bangladesh, Vietnam,   Jersey) and new products (Business Banking Client Mortgage) and Medium  Enterprises (ME).

        "page_content": "A deeper dive into each risk type is provided in the following section.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFor many banks, Credit Risk presents the largest proportion of risk they face on their books. The industry has developed sophisticated management frameworks, which provide a baseline level of effective mitigation from risks. However, these industry-wide, existing processes have not yet evolved to account for the unprecedented level and type of risk that climate change brings, and additional climate risk-specific analysis is required as the tools and methodologies mature.\n\n## Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) Credit Risk\n\nFor CPBB, we have made progress in embedding Climate Risk into mainstream portfolio management in 2022. Our approach is currently more advanced for the Consumer Mortgage business, which is CPBB's largest portfolio and for which there are identifiable and measurable risks applicable to the residential property collateral. Across CPBB, our risk identification and measurement focuses on acute and forward-looking physical risks (storm, flood, wildfire, and sea-level rise) across key markets.\n\nIn 2021, this covered approximately 65 per cent of the total CPBB consumer business book. In 2022, this was expanded to three additional markets for Consumer Mortgages and select markets for other CPBB products (Business Banking Client Mortgages and Medium Enterprises, representing 3 per cent and 1.6 per cent of the consumer business book respectively).\n\nWe use the output of the Physical Risk assessments of our Consumer Mortgage property locations to inform discussions during our credit portfolio quarterly reviews, and to periodically monitor concentration exposure to the perils identified above.\n\nWithin the Consumer Mortgage business, we have developed internal guidance on physical Climate Risk management for all our markets. The recommendations covered through this include the establishment of a zoning policy with differentiated criteria according to the level of exposure concentration to physical risk, the setting of risk mitigations where appropriate, as well as accounting for government-led adaptation measures on Physical Risk if it has not been considered before. A key design step has been to set up the framework for a holistic approach, catering for market forces when establishing the zoning policy, including the setting of appropriate trigger monitoring and escalation measures.\n\nWe currently offer differentiated loan-to-value for select ESG focused structured products, which align with the Bank's Green and Sustainable Product Framework.\n\nThe focus for 2023 will be to further develop our approach for assessing the physical and transition impact of unsecured consumer lending products such as credit cards and personal loans and initiate work on measuring Transition Risk vulnerabilities of our Consumer Mortgage portfolios. We aim to utilise proxied financed emissions for our key markets to begin model transition risk for consumer mortgages. We recognise that the data limitation will continue to persist given the lack of property-level data on energy consumption and limited energy label coverage in the key markets we operate in. To improve the accuracy of our financed emissions measurement capabilities, we partnered with Imperial College to refine our energy consumption derivation methodology, including the enhancement of our emissions factor database for major markets.\n\nWe undertake quarterly scenario analysis for the eight key Consumer Mortgage portfolios, focusing on sea-level rise across 3 RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) in the year 2100.\n\n## Assessment of gross Physical Risk profile for Consumer Mortgages showing outstanding exposure subject to very high gross Physical Risk *\n\n|                                     | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   | Outstanding exposure at very high gross Physical Risk %   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical risk event                 | Korea                                                     | Hong Kong                                                 | Taiwan                                                    | India                                                     | Malaysia                                                  | Singapore                                                 | UAE                                                       | Indonesia                                                 | Others                                                    | Globally                                                  |\n| Flood (Acute)                       | 14%                                                       | 45%                                                       | 12%                                                       | 23%                                                       | 6%                                                        | 3%                                                        | 30%                                                       | 21%                                                       | 52%                                                       | 26%                                                       |\n| Sea-level rise  (Chronic - RPC 8.5) | 1%                                                        | 4%                                                        | 0%                                                        | 1%                                                        | 0%                                                        | 0%                                                        | 36%                                                       | 2%                                                        | 1%                                                        | 2%                                                        |",

Over time, sovereigns and policymakers are expected to drive market trends such as investment in adaptation financing, technological advancements, innovative risk transfer and mitigation approaches to combat the potential impacts of climate change. Presently, we do not see any significant stress over the short-term horizon on account of Physical Risk in our Consumer Mortgage and Business Banking Mortgage portfolios.\n\n## Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) Credit Risk\n\nOur client-level Climate Risk Questionnaire (CRQ) helps us assess the potential financial risks from climate change using both quantitative and qualitative information across five key pillars. The assessment presents a consolidated view of how the individual company has performed with regards to overall Climate Risk, how it sits within the sector as well as a regional view against benchmarks.\n\nPhysical Risk for our corporate client locations is assessed using Munich Re's NATHAN tool, which helps us evaluate the impact from current and acute risks of operating asset locations as sourced from S&P's Trucost asset location data.\n\nA view of Transition Risk across a variety of global transition pathways is derived using a climate change scenario modelling tool as well as a temperature alignment tool.\n\nWe have also identified relevant climate policy inputs at a sector and regional level and assessed the specific impact timeframe that an entity may face, to provide an understanding of Transition Risk applicable to each client. Their outputs are fed into our client-level Climate Risk Questionnaires (CRQ) to help to create a multi-dimensional consolidated assessment of Climate Risk.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we had embedded assessments in our existing credit process for clients covering approximately 85 per cent of high Transition Risk sectors (i.e. Oil and gas, Mining and Power) and 65 per cent of the Group's total corporate exposure (c. 2,100 clients assessed).\n\nWhere climate change is expected to manifest into a financial risk in the near-term, we may find it appropriate to apply warning signals, such as risk triggers through an enhanced due diligence conducted by the Group Climate Risk and Credit Risk teams. In 2023, we intend to look at implementing guidance to allow adjustments to credit grading scorecards and additional monitoring mechanisms, for example through our Early Alert process. One of our key focus areas is to develop a pilot framework to help inform these credit decisions and we aim to embed this framework by December 2023.",

Additionally, as part of our ongoing agenda to accurately measure the total impact from Climate Risk, we have started to develop an approach for assessing the Climate Risk of our clients' collateral across property, shipping and aviation and will begin incorporating this into our Climate Risk assessments when finalised. For the shipping and aviation sectors, we assess the vulnerability to transition risk of the underlying collateral asset itself (aircraft or carriers), whereas for property collateral, Physical risk related vulnerabilities are prioritised.\n\nThe client assessments not only help form a view of the overall Climate Risk vulnerabilities and readiness for clients but provide a tool for data gathering and analysis of the underlying themes that drive Climate Risk and its mitigations. The following section gives insights gained from all completed Client Risk assessments performed over 2022 (2,100 entities covering approximately 65 per cent of corporate net nominal exposure), compared with the previous year (covering 1,940 entities), to highlight the direction of travel across our portfolio.

Two-thirds of clients now acknowledge Climate Risk as a financial risk to their direct operations and/ or supply chain, while only 58 per cent have a quantifiable climate policy or commitment in place. These have both increased since our 2021 assessment, reflecting an increase in our coverage, as well as a positive movement from companies to disclose their climate-related risks, moving to over half of assessed clients.\n\n## Results from our client-level Climate Risk assessment on governance and disclosure*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Data as of Nov 22\n\n## Transition Risk readiness\n\nThis pillar of the CRA covers the intent, progress and capability of the client to mitigate the risks in transitioning to a net zero economy. There has been a drop in the percentage of clients reporting Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Despite this, the number of clients that have set Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions reduction targets has grown, showing a positive trend towards setting quantifiable commitments to action against climate change. This is encouraging as it shows quantifiable steps taken by corporates to act on their transition plans.\n\n## Results from our client-level Climate Risk assessment on transition readiness*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n## Percentage of clients in scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Future strategy * Data as of Nov 22\n\nconsiders carbon price\n\n2021\n\n20%\n\n14%\n\n## Physical Risk readiness\n\nThrough this pillar, we are seeking to assess if clients have quantified the financial impact of physical risks and understand if they are taking proportionate adaptation actions.\n\nWe have seen a positive movement in the number of clients acknowledging the impact that physical risks could have on their direct operations, up to 54 per cent, while those adopting adaptation measures against these risks has only climbed by 1 per cent.

This is despite our increased coverage of clients with high Climate Risk scores.\n\nScores were on average better in developed economies and regions (EU, US, UK) and on average lower in the emerging markets (AAME), and this observation was seen consistently across the assessment pillars. This is driven by the increased level of climate policy and regulation in the developed economies and regions; however, clients in these markets are also subject to higher expectations and scrutiny as a result.\n\nPhysical Risk adaptation scored the lowest across all five questionnaire sections, indicating a low readiness of corporates to potential climate-related events, while gross Physical Risk scores decreased to 69 per cent in 2022 from 70 per cent in 2021. This is driven by an increased assessment coverage in our Asia region, where there is a higher frequency of physical risk hazards (e.g. storms and flooding).\n\nOverall levels and consistency in the availability of climate information from public disclosures is still low, and in many cases absent, which highlights the importance of carrying out direct engagement with our clients.\n\n## Benefits from the client engagement\n\nWe learned a lot from undertaking the client assessments, and so did our clients. The benefits included:\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement of our data coverage, especially where this was not publicly available, and strengthening the quality of our risk assessments and modelling capabilities. The client-level risk assessments are now being integrated into the CCIB Credit Risk underwriting process.\n- \u00b7 Clients were interested in seeing their Climate Risk profiles, as well as the tools and methodologies we use to quantify their Transition Risk. They were also interested in how to improve their climate-related reporting and disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Internal capability-building of our client bankers and risk teams, with all affected frontline staff required to complete internal climate-risk training.",

        "page_content": "## Vulnerable sectors to Climate Risk\n\nClimate change impacts almost all the sectors within the economy. However, we note that there are certain sectors that are more vulnerable to climate risks under different Transition Risk and Physical Risk scenarios.\n\nOur approach to Transition Risk assessment is data-led, covering a broad range of sectors and at a company level where data is available and use of proxies in absence of granular information. We use a climate-change scenario model, which helps us to assess potential credit-grade movements for our corporate clients over a 30-year time horizon for a range of scenarios ranging from NGFS scenarios as well as the IEA scenarios. This is based on a sample of 2,388 corporate client entities covering 53 per cent of corporate good book on net nominal basis. We have used the MSCI Market Classification to assign countries or regions as developed or emerging markets.\n\n## Caution about the metrics\n\nScenario-based potential credit downgrades are one approach for estimating future Transition Risk. The probability of default metrics that inform potential credit downgrades capture the potential impact to clients' financials under different transition scenarios.\n\nThe potential credit downgrades estimated do not factor in the transition mitigation plans that our clients and the Group will undertake over the next 30 years and represent the gross risks we are exposed to.\n\nThe results indicate a 'what if' analysis, and not a 'what is likely to happen' view. As climate action increases globally, clients, sovereigns and banks are likely to take additional mitigation measures to manage transition risks.\n\nA 30-year period inherently brings challenges around forecasting likely outcomes, due to the uncertainties associated with the speed and direction of transition, including breakthrough technological developments, sovereign policies and management responses.\n\n## Projected potential average minor notch credit grade downgrade by 2050 based on our climate scenario analysis of the in-scope sample corporate portfolio*\n\n|

impact our portfolios disproportionately, depending on the region and sector. Fossil fuel dependent sectors that are most sensitive to emissions reduction policies are likely to see larger credit downgrades over a 30-year period. Oil and gas, Metals and mining, Transportation, Automotive and Commercial Real Estate are the sectors most impacted in the NGFS scenarios, while the oil and gas sector is likely to be most impacted under the IEA scenarios. Compared with our 2021 disclosures, the impact is relatively muted given the scenario selection and underlying scenario pathways being more benign as provided in the NGFS and IEA scenario datasets.",

        "page_content": "## Sectors exposed to Transition Risk\n\nThe vulnerable industries list identified below is based on the expected increase in potential additional costs driven by adopting new technology, changing energy mix towards renewables and associated technology adoption costs as well as an application of a carbon price over a long-term horizon which will eventually impact the companies' ability to remain profitable in the long run.\n\nSectors most impacted by Transition Risk include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOil and gas, including coal and the manufacture of refined petroleum products. Industry efforts to decarbonise are currently supported by switching to gas, biofuels, hydrogen and renewables, as well as leveraging technologies such as Carbon Capture and other emissions abatement projects. The oil and gas sector plays a central role in global efforts to decarbonise, with several of our clients having already committed to decarbonisation targets, most with carbon intensity targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Another linked sector that is likely to be impacted is the Commodity Traders linked to upstream and downstream supply chains for Oil and gas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPower: Our focus remains on selectively financing grid expansion and renewable energy, recognising that these are key enabling technologies that support the transition towards greener sources of power. Switching to abated gas will be key in the short-term to support the transition away from thermal coal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMetals and mining: This sector provides raw materials that support much of the global economy including those required for building and scaling clean energy technologies at the rate required in the NZ scenario. The sector contributes around 12 per cent of global emissions (Scope 1 and 2), of which Asia, Africa and the Middle East contribute more than 75 per cent. Structural changes in demand, combined with financial and regulatory pressures, are driving increased awareness of the need for companies in this sector to decarbonise operations. Some of our clients have already committed to net zero targets and we are working with them to reduce their emissions through financing transition technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransportation: This covers a range of sub-sectors that primarily rely on the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel to deliver its direct and indirect services. Burning fuels directly results in the release of CO 2 and other emissions into the atmosphere and contribute significantly to Scope 3 emissions on many other industries.\n\nThese sub-sectors consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Aviation, such as airlines and air transport entities themselves, aircraft manufacturers as well as air transport services, such as airports and ground staff.\n- \u00b7 Shipping, such as freighting services as well as entities that maintain and operate ports and terminals.\n- \u00b7 Automobiles, including the production and manufacture of automobiles and their components, as well as any related service companies.\n\n## Sectors exposed to Physical Risk\n\nBelow vulnerable industries are shortlisted based on expected physical damage to the industry over a longer time horizon.\n\nReal Estate activities: One of the sectors that is most likely to be impacted is Real Estate activities. Given the nature of the asset-backed lending, an increased frequency and severity of acute weather events and increase in chronic risks will significantly increase damage costs that the Real Estate portfolio will be exposed to if adaptation measures taken are not significant.\n\nManufacture of food and agricultural products: Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change and therefore from the impact higher carbon emissions can have on local climate and the environment. Dry summers or heavy rainfall seasons could dramatically impact crops, leading to significant fluctuations in profitability and risks for companies throughout the supply chain.\n\nThe impact in developed markets is found to be higher than that in emerging markets. This is driven by higher regional carbon prices in developed markets which lead to a higher number of defaults over the next 30 years.\n\n## Reputational and Sustainability Risk\n\nClimate Risk is considered within the Reputational and Sustainability Risk Framework, for our corporate clients, through an assessment of a client's ability to meet their own climate related commitments, as well as satisfy the Group's public ambitions and position statements as well as its responsibilities for ESG risk management.\n\nWe have continued to perform additional client-level due diligence leveraging our Climate Risk questionnaires where possible to identify additional Reputational Risk from climaterelated factors.\n\nThis additional due diligence is conducted by the Group Climate Risk team for (i) clients in our high Transition Risk and Phase 1 net zero sectors (Oil and gas, Power, Metals and mining), (ii) clients with a coal nexus 1 as well as (iii) those that have been assessed at client level as high Climate Risk. Given the lack of attribution for Physical Risk events, the assessment concentrates on Transition Risk. The assessment focuses on three pillars covering both client and transaction level aspects:\n\n## Client level\n\n- \u00b7 Temperature alignment scoring and a comparison to the client's peers.\n- \u00b7 Client-level transition readiness and robustness of plans from Climate Risk Questionnaires or through desktop assessments\n\n## Transaction level\n\n- \u00b7 Emissions impact of transactions considering both internal and regional contexts.\n- * Data as of Nov 22\n- 1 As defined by the Group's public Position Statement to only provide financial services to clients who, by 2030, are less than 5% dependent on thermal coal (based on % revenue).",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Of the case reviews completed, an increase in Reputational Risk rating was suggested for ~13 per cent of transactions. These consisted of companies in both the oil and gas and manufacturing sectors, primarily looking to procure coal or other high-carbon emitting products for manufacturing, production or wholesale purposes. In addition, some entities with high temperature alignment scores and no clear transition plan were raised as having additional risk and rating increases recommended.\n\nThe above-mentioned due diligence is in addition to wider existing environmental and social (E&S) risk management processes as well as our oversight against our Position Statements and Prohibited Activities list. During 2022, we have enhanced this E&S process through the Environmental & Social Risk Assessment (ESRA) to identify clients and transactions which may be more susceptible to reputational risk by assessing clients' level of commitment and strategy to manage climate change as well as their level of alignment to international standards of greenhouse gas emissions reporting.\n\nThis is intended to ensure a greater level of oversight of clients' readiness to manage climate change and the limitations on business activities that could result in a significant shift in stakeholder views (from both environmental and social impact) and/or negative perception by investors and the market.\n\nWhere negative perception exists or there is exposure to clients that do not comply with E&S criteria, reviews are conducted at a client level to identify root causes and propose mitigation plans, which are agreed with the relationship manager. These may involve client engagement, commitment from clients to take corrective action in the context of their business, or may result in potential run down if corrections cannot be achieved.\n\nAdditionally, where specific criteria in Position Statements are not fully met or there are individual clients that do not comply with the enhanced E&S criteria, these may be deemed to have high/very high reputational risks and are escalated to the Group Responsibility and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC) for client and transactional determinations.\n\n## Weighted average temperature alignment (WATA) - 2030 by client sectors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The weighted average of approximately 20 other sectors to which the Group has the lowest net nominal exposure\n\nWe have also set a Risk Appetite for our exposure concentration to clients with a high-temperature alignment combined with low-transition readiness.\n\nWe use temperature alignment as a metric to inform our client-level Climate Risk assessment, which is part of the Reputational and Sustainability Risk reviews for clients and transactions as mentioned above. Temperature alignment is one way to consider a company's impact on climate change and an approach to estimate the emissions profile of our clients. It is calculated based on emission intensities and volume of hydrocarbons produced. It maps the company's forward-looking carbon intensity and hydrocarbon production outlook (where applicable) against a temperature alignment score.\n\nWe assessed the weighted average temperature alignment (WATA) of 2,388 corporate client entities (covering 53 per cent of corporate good book on net nominal basis) by high-carbon sector, projected to 2030. As part of our 2023 modelling roadmap, we are also looking to develop an in-house methodology to model temperature alignment and overall reduce reliance on third-party modelling capabilities.\n\n## Caution about the metrics\n\n- \u00b7 Temperature alignment is an emerging concept, and industry-wide standards on methodology are still evolving. We expect our approach to evolve in line with best practice.\n- \u00b7 Client-level emissions were only available for about 37 per cent of corporate clients, so sector average proxies were used for the remaining entities. In 2023, we aim to refresh existing assessments as well as expand our coverage to c.4,000 clients. The client assessments not only help form a view of the overall Climate Risk vulnerabilities and readiness for clients but provide a tool for data gathering and analysis of the underlying themes that drive Climate Risk and its mitigations. Additionally, expanded coverage from the existing vendor engagement will help to bridge the data gaps.\n\n## Insights\n\n- \u00b7 Our overall average is 3.25\u2070C, indicating that our portfolio is largely in line with the current global emissions and temperature trajectory.\n- \u00b7 Compared to other sectors within our portfolio, Utilities and CRE have a higher temperature alignment compared to other sectors, given the dependence on high-carbon emitting production, but our portfolio temperature alignment for these sectors is below the sector average.\n- \u00b7 Compared to the previous year, average sector temperature alignment scores have increased across most of the sectors. This increase is driven by improvements in both emission data coverage for our clients (i.e. reduced use of proxies) and changes in the third-party temperature alignment scoring methodology. A maximum increase of 26 per cent for CRE is observed where WATA score has increased from 3.1 in 2021 to 3.8 in 2022. Telecommunication (26 per cent increase) and Consumer durables and apparel (24 per cent increase) are other notable sectors with an increase in WATA.",

        "page_content": "## Country Risk\n\nThe Group has developed a set of Physical and Transition risk rankings, to identify from a set of 165 sovereigns globally that are deemed most vulnerable and least ready to adapt and mitigate climate-related Physical and Transition risks.\n\n- \u00b7 The Physical Risk rankings are based on a set of publicly available scores such as ND-Gain Country Index and GermanWatch Climate Risk Index, as well as S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service.\n- \u00b7 The Transition Risk rankings are based on an internally developed methodology which comprises a combination of both climate and macroeconomic data.\n\nThe two pillars underlying this assessment include the Sovereigns' Gross Transition Risks (such as reliance on carbon-intense sectors, import and export of fossil fuels, gap to fill to meet 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions targets) and Transition Risk Mitigations established (such as low-carbon energy production in place, imports of low-carbon technology, governments' ability and credibility to support the transition). The two pillars are further combined to obtain a measure of Net Transition Risk for each market.\n\nBased on their aggregated Physical and Transition risk scores, sovereigns are split into decile-based rankings. These rankings are a qualitative input to the Group Country Risk reviews for sovereign credit grades and limits, inputs to various climate-related stress tests and computation of Country Risk Benchmarks and Risk Appetite. They are also used as proxies for missing client asset location information in Climate Risk Assessments.\n\n## Insight\n\n- \u00b7 For Physical Risk, the bulk of exposure is located in sovereigns which score in the top half (buckets 1 to 5), with over 2 per cent in the two lowest categories (buckets 9 and 10).\n- \u00b7 Similarly, for Transition Risk, the bulk of exposure is located in sovereigns which score in the top half, with less than 1 per cent in the two lowest categories (buckets 9 and 10).\n- \u00b7 This indicates that the Group is overall well positioned in managing its climate-related physical and transition risks. The combined exposures in the two worst categories are also well below the Group's current Risk Appetite escalation levels.\n\n## Caution about the metrics\n\n- \u00b7 The rankings are informed by external indices.\n- -  Physical Risk rankings are based on four scores (ND-Gain Country Index/GermanWatch Climate Risk Index/S&P Global Ratings/Moody's Investors Service)\n- -  Transition Risk rankings are based on Gross Transition Risk and Transition Risk Mitigation factors, with data sourced from World Bank/OECD/S&P/International Monetary Fund/Fitch Ratings\n- \u00b7 The computation inputs are based on latest available data which may be dated. Proxies have been used where data for the sovereign is not available.\n- \u00b7 The ranking uses equally spaced decile scores and provides the results in an ordinal manner. While the simplicity helps in adoption and provides the relative position of the sovereigns, other systems may provide more information.\n\n## Physical and Transition Risk rankings methodological deep dives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition Risk\n\n| Reiliance on fossil  fuel imports and  exports    | Carbon footprint of  imports and efforts                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Emission footprint  per capita                    | Energy efficiency  levels                                   |\n| Governments'  effectiveness in  achieving targets | Governments' fiscal  flexibility to support  the transition |\n| Low-carbon energy  production capacity            | Imports of  low-carbon  technology products                 |",

A key development this year has been that all material Third-Party Corporate Service arrangements in scope for Business Continuity Management controls are subject to Climate Risk assessment as part of third-party continuity plans.\n\nWe analysed approximately 1,000 of our operating locations across branches, offices, data centres and other sites to assess the gross Physical Risk profile.\n\n## Caution about the metrics\n\nThe metrics are based on outputs from Munich Re's natural catastrophe model and do not assume adaptation measures such as building quality, hazard protection infrastructure (such as flood defences) or government adaptation policies.\n\n## Assessment of gross Physical Risk at our own operating locations*\n\n|                               |              |          | Operating locations at extreme Physical Risk (%)   | Operating locations at extreme Physical Risk (%)   | Operating locations at extreme Physical Risk (%)   | Operating locations at extreme Physical Risk (%)   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical risk event           | Time horizon | Scenario | Korea                                              | UAE                                                | Indonesia                                          | Globally                                           |\n| Flood (Acute)                 | 2022         | N/A      | 26%                                                | 10%                                                | 16%                                                | 22%                                                |\n| Wildfire (Acute)              |              |          | 0%                                                 | 0%                                                 | 0%                                                 | 0%                                                 |\n| Storm (Acute)                 |              |          | 20%                                                | 1%                                                 | 5%                                                 | 15%                                                |\n| Sea-level rise (Chronic)      | 2100         | RCP 8.5  | 1%                                                 | 4%                                                 | 0%                                                 | 2%                                                 |\n| Number of operating locations |              |          | 734                                                | 223                                                | 37                                                 | 994                                                |\n\n- * Data as of Nov 22",

Those expectations are broadly aligned in principle, but local implementations could vary. We have actively worked with industry bodies and regulators to promote consistency in policy making around the globe.\n\nOver 2022, we have developed horizon-scanning capabilities for climate-related regulations as well as a global register. We on-boarded external counsel to assist with horizon-scanning of ESG-related regulations for both Group and 13 of our key markets in standard regulatory scanning and identification. Aggregating inputs from both external counsel and internal markets, a global obligations register has been established to provide a complete view of the current obligations and upcoming regulatory requirements. We have documented an operating model clarifying roles and responsibilities across the Group and our markets to establish clear ownership of sustainability regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philippines - BSP\n\nDraft environmental risk management guidelines in Sep 21 Draft circular on climate risk stress testing Aug 22\n\n## Hong Kong - HKMA\n\nSupervisory Manual on climate risk management published in Dec 21, effective Dec 22\n\nPilot climate stress testing conducted in 2021\n\n## China - CBIRC\n\nGreen Finance guidelines issued in Jun 22\n\n## Nepal - BoN\n\nGuidelines on climate risk management in Feb 22\n\n## Japan - JFSA\n\nGuidelines on climate risk management in Jul 22",

        "page_content": "## Treasury Risk\n\nFrom a capital perspective, Climate Risk considerations have been part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) submissions since 2019. Our approach for assessing the Climate Risk impact on capital adequacy has improved from qualitative judgements to quantitative simulations with the availability of tools and greater understanding of our portfolio.\n\nFor the 2022 ICAAP submission, we moved towards a more quantitative approach comparing the worst (annualised) five-year loss period from all three NGFS scenarios to the projected peak losses from the 2022 Group ICAAP. The Late Action scenario was identified to drive the maximum difference in losses; however, this was lower than credit losses experienced under the ICAAP macroeconomic stress scenario, concluding that additional capital add-on was not required for Climate Risk. The severity and potential impact on our clients' loan impairment level under climate scenarios was lower than the ICAAP scenario and we determined that an additional capital buffer was not required.\n\nThe approach for incorporating climate related credit risks into the Group's ICAAP is set to continue using scenario driven analysis to best judge the financial impact of Climate Risk. It is envisaged however that as understanding of Climate Risk management and potential forward-looking scenarios develops, this may lead to evolution in our approach and assessment including using a wide range of scenario outcomes to determine any potential capital related impact in the future.\n\nFrom a Liquidity Risk perspective, we conducted a proof-ofconcept analysis to assess climate risk-related vulnerabilities and readiness of approximately 77 per cent of the corporate liquidity portfolio, leveraging the client outreach and data gathering exercise being undertaken on the asset side. The analysis showed that exposure concentration in the 'high transition risk and low readiness' bucket is broadly comparable to what we see for our top corporate client exposures on the asset side. Liquidity providers with high transition risk are from the Oil and gas, Pharma, Transport storage - others and Utilities sectors. We will continue to enhance our analysis capabilities and exposure coverage through 2023, including embedding climate related liquidity considerations within our Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process.",

In April 2022, we launched our 'Understanding Sustainability' online learning, and more than 12,800 (15 per cent) of colleagues voluntarily completed this programme during the year.\n\nTo recognise their engagement, we planted a tree for each employee completing the training in our 'Standard Chartered Forest', which spans seven of our footprint markets and is tended by local NGOs.\n\n## Climate-related financial and non-financial risk training\n\nFor Climate Risk specifically, the Board were given training that provided an overview of how Climate Risk is being embedded across the three lines of defence, as well as what this means for our clients and colleagues.\n\nIn addition, we launched Risk-wide mandatory e-learnings, and provided 35 hours of bespoke classroom-based training for almost 4,000 colleagues across CCIB, CPBB, Risk and Audit. Recordings of these sessions are available to all staff to access as convenient.\n\nIn Q1 2023, we intend to embed Climate Risk-related credit training material into both our first and second line Credit Risk curricula. In addition, in partnership with our academic partner, Imperial College London, we also aim to launch a detailed online training programme available to all impacted staff.\n\n## Sustainable Finance and ESRM training\n\nIn 2022, we focused on educating colleagues across all levels of the Group on our net zero pathway and Sustainable Finance initiatives. We launched foundational sustainability and Sustainable Finance curricula across the Group; provided dedicated training on our Sustainable Finance product suite and Position Statements; hosted panel discussions on key themes including greenwashing risk and ESG ratings; and held topical sessions on net zero and Transition Finance concepts, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and decarbonisation market trends.\n\nIn 2023, our Sustainable Finance education programmes will accelerate. This will include the roll-out of a tiered practitionerlevel learning curriculum, and further modularisation of our Sustainable Finance training to help us improve knowledge and awareness across our network.\n\n## Incentive structure\n\nVariable remuneration is applicable to employees through the Group Scorecard and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). This is overseen by the Board-level Remuneration Committee. Selected sustainability targets, including those with a climate change dimension, are incorporated into our annual Group Scorecard which informs variable remuneration for all colleagues under our Target Total Variable Compensation plan, including executive directors and the Group Management Team.\n\nSustainability has also been included in the 2023-25 LTIP performance measures, with an increased focus on the broader impact of client activity, rather than on our internal operations. The sustainability measures in the 2023-25 plan include:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Finance income in excess of $1 billion by 2025\n- \u00b7 Delivery of the net zero roadmap\n- \u00b7 Contribution to the advancement of sustainability ecosystem\n\nThe Group scorecard includes the following for 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Progress against the Group's aim to achieve net zero by 2050\n- \u00b7 Improve community engagement through employee volunteering participation\n\nIn addition to the Group Scorecard and LTIP performance measures, dedicated climate and sustainability-related objectives apply across functional and regional scorecards including the Risk function, and individual objectives add a further link between sustainability and reward. Specifically, in relation to the delivery of core aspects of our climate change approach, several individuals and teams have objectives which impact variable remuneration.",

        "page_content": "## Social Sustainability\n\nWhile it's clear that our main impact on society and the environment is through the businesses we finance, we aim to be a force for good for our clients, people and communities. To us, that not only means ensuring that we are minimising our own environmental impact, but also striving to be a responsible company: utilising our skills, experience and network to fight financial crime, embedding our values across the markets where we operate, and investing in our people and communities.\n\n## Conduct and ethics\n\nGood conduct is critical to delivering positive outcomes for our clients, markets and stakeholders. It's fundamental to achieving our brand promise, here for good.\n\nOur Conduct Risk management approach has been strengthened since 2021 through several initiatives, including launching a new annual Conduct Risk management effectiveness review, which increased our ability to identify and mitigate against Conduct Risk, and re-energising our engagement strategy.\n\nOur Speaking Up programme is essential to upholding our here for good brand promise and valued behaviours. The early disclosure of concerns reduces the risk of financial and reputational loss caused by misconduct. We encourage colleagues, contractors, clients, suppliers and members of the public to use our Speaking Up programme which offers secure and confidential channels to report known or suspected misconduct without fear of retaliation. Examples of concerns include breaches of regulatory requirements, breaches of Group policy or standards, or behaviour that has adverse effects on colleagues and/or our reputation.\n\nThe Speaking Up programme continues to be utilised across all countries, businesses and functions, and our 2022 MyVoice survey found that 88 per cent of employees (87 per cent in 2021) felt comfortable raising concerns through the channels. Despite this, 2022 saw a 9.6 per cent (113 cases) decrease noted in the volume of total disclosures via Speaking Up channels compared with the previous period. This is a trend noted across the industry, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to influence internal reporting trends. 15\n\nThroughout 2022, we hosted a series of awareness campaigns to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of upholding our conduct standards and know how, and when, to Speak Up. To celebrate Whistleblowers' Day on 23 June, we held a month-long global campaign themed around 'Doing the Right Thing One Speak Up at a Time', and in October colleagues in Africa and the Middle East region ran a regional Conduct Week. In December, we celebrated Conduct Month and UN Anti-Corruption Day, under the theme 'The Stands, Conduct and Me', highlighting the link between the day-today conduct of individual colleagues and the Bank's Stands. All campaigns included interactive messages from our senior leaders and live panel discussions designed to both set the tone from the top and nurture it from within.\n\nThe Group Code of Conduct (the Code) remains the primary tool through which we set our conduct expectations: it supports all our policies, setting minimum standards and reinforcing our valued and expected behaviours. It also outlines a framework to help colleagues make good decisions. To reinforce our shared commitment to the highest possible standards of conduct, each year we ask our colleagues to reconsider what the Code means to them through a refresher e-learning, and to reaffirm their commitment. In 2022, 99.5 per cent of our colleagues completed the mandatory training and affirmation. Colleagues who are overdue without a valid reason (i.e. for which they are given an exemption) are subject to a 40 per cent reduction in their annual variable compensation for the year they failed to attest.\n\nIn 2023, we plan to refresh the Code to improve alignment with our Stands, strengthen the link between ethics, culture and conduct, and intertwine the Code with the Group strategy. We also intend to take steps to make the Code more accessible and relatable to all colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDownload our Group Code of Conduct at sc.com/codeofconduct and visit sc.com/speakingup to find more about how our Speaking Up programme works\n\n% colleagues affirmed commitment to Code of Conduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99.5",

But the financial system is also used by those involved in some of today's most damaging crimes - from human trafficking to terrorism, corruption and the drug trade. Our ambition is to help tackle these crimes by making the financial system a hostile environment for criminals and terrorists. We have no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to financial crime.\n\nOur Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance (CFCC) team sets our financial crime risk management framework. We seek to safeguard our clients and communities against money laundering (AML), terrorist financing, sanctions, fraud and other risks, applying core controls such as client due-diligence, screening and monitoring, and strengthening our people's understanding as to how to identify, manage and mitigate such risks. In addition, anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) controls aim to prevent colleagues, or third parties working on our behalf, from engaging in bribery.\n\nA particular focus of our financial crime investigatory teams is the use of data analytics to identify those clients and cases which generate the greatest financial crime risk. This has strengthened the second line of defence in support of colleagues in business lines and country teams across the Group.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of financial crime, particularly laundering the proceeds of corruption, in the lead-up to, during and after major political elections in footprint markets, the Group conducts enhanced monitoring designed to identify and investigate transactions of potential concern. In 2022, enhanced monitoring was conducted during major elections and times of political transition or conflict, for example in Kenya, Angola, Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka.\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the authorities of the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, and several other nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia by targeting a wide range of Russian entities (state-owned and private) and a large number of Russian elites, oligarchs, political leaders and officials. While the pace of change and the complexity of these sanctions against Russia are unprecedented and had the potential to create areas of uncertainty as to the scope of some of the regulatory prohibitions, we have sought to comply with these requirements fully and promptly. This work has been a significant area of focus for Financial Crime Compliance teams during 2022.\n\nWe have invested significantly to ensure our employees are properly equipped to combat financial crime. In 2022, 99.7 per cent of colleagues and governance body members completed financial crime e-learnings which cover ABC, AML, sanctions and fraud topics (Asia: 99.7 per cent, AME: 99.7 per cent, EA: 99.8 per cent, Governance body members: 100 per cent). For those in high-risk roles and functions, additional targeted ABC training, masterclasses and forums were held to deepen understanding. We also shared our Supplier Charter, which sets out our aspirations and provides guidance related to ABC, with more than 11,700 suppliers and third parties across 48 markets.\n\nThis was supported by our Group-wide communication campaign, 'The whole story', which aimed to raise employee awareness of the real-life impact of financial crime and highlight the work we are doing individually and collectively to build a robust Risk Culture and lead in the fight against financial crime. In 2022, the theme for The Whole Story was 'Connecting the Dots' and focused on our efforts to fight crime by 'Connecting, Collaborating and Communicating', and building partnerships with government bodies, regulators and other global banks to strengthen our collective defences.\n\nThese public-private partnerships include initiatives with the International Center for Missing & Exploited Children which focuses on the use of cryptoassets in the trade of child exploitation and abuse material; the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance which assists law enforcement in identifying significant organised groups engaged in business email compromise schemes; and US Customs and Border Protection which focuses on economic security, trade security, forced labour and other risk areas, such as Trade Based Money Laundering. These partnerships are producing material new insights about various criminal typologies and advances in how we collectively combat financial crime in an increasing number of jurisdictions, including Singapore, South Africa, the UK and Hong Kong.\n\nThroughout 2022, we also engaged with peers in contributing to the ongoing dialogue to advance effectiveness in combating financial crime through our active participation in several of the leading industry groups, including the Wolfsberg Group of global banks (Including our Global Head of FCC serving as co-chair and hosting the September meeting of the organisation), Madison Group and UK Finance. We also participated in discussions and forums with many external thought leaders including the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI).\n\nFighting financial crime\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more, visit sc.com/fightingfinancialcrime\n\nRead our Fair Pay Report at\n\nhttps://av.sc.com/corp-en/content/docs/fair-pay-report.pdf",

We recognise that the global nature of our business may expose us to the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking (MSHT) in our operations, supply chain and customer and client relationships, and we are committed to identifying and mitigating these risks.\n\nOur approach to managing and mitigating environmental and social risk is reflected in our Sustainability Framework, which includes a Position Statement on Human Rights. The framework outlines the cross-sector and thematic Position Statements that we use to assess whether to provide financial services to our clients. These documents, informed by international best practice and the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Environmental and Social Performance Standards, outline the cross-sector standards that form part of the credit approval processes for CCIB clients and transactions.\n\nOur Modern Slavery Statement details our actions to tackle MSHT across our CCIB client base, supply chain and workforce. In 2022, we enhanced our human rights due diligence by requiring CCIB clients to provide evidence of their policies and processes to manage potential human rights risks in their operations or supply chains. We also developed more detailed guidance for clients on grievance mechanisms in line with IFC guidelines and UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. We continued to work with third parties, such as the Thun Group and Sustainable Shipping Initiative, to promote coordinated action against MSHT.\n\nWe completed a risk review of our supply chain and supplemented our MSHT assessment questionnaire with geopolitical analysis. We also plan to review enhancements to MSHT controls in our procurement system alongside broader ESG requirements under review.\n\nFor our workforce, we introduced a refreshed set of Industrial Relations principles that take into consideration the fundamental ILO conventions. We also expanded pay gap reporting to include ethnicity data. Our ethnicity pay gap reporting covered the United Kingdom and United States, having achieved the minimum required levels of ethnicity declared by employees in these regions to make pay gap analysis possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our Modern Slavery Slavery Statement at sc.com/modernslavery\n\nRead out Human Rights Position Statement at sc.com/positionstatements\n\n## Impact in our communities\n\nYoung people across the world - women and girls in particular - continue to face barriers to economic inclusion. Many fall short of their potential and become stuck in low-income poverty. The future of work also presents challenges - an estimated 50 per cent of employees worldwide will need reskilling by 2025 16 , as adoption of technology increases. Accessing the relevant training will be vital for young people.\n\nWe seek to amplify our social impact and continue to support communities through Futuremakers, our global initiative to tackle youth economic inclusion. Futuremakers supports disadvantaged young people, especially girls and people with visual impairments, to learn new skills and improve their chances of getting a job or starting their own business.\n\nIn 2022, we contributed $14.7 million to Futuremakers, including donations from the Group and fundraising of $3.8 million from our employees and partners, to enable the next generation to learn, earn and grow.\n\nWith our international and local partners, including the Standard Chartered Foundation, in 2022 we reached more than 335,000 young people through Futuremakers, including providing financial education to 102,248 unbanked or young people. In India, we continue to support eye health and water, sanitation and hygiene education (WASHE) in alignment with development priorities in the market.\n\nOur Futuremakers Impact Report reviews the progress we have made through Futuremakers since its launch in 2019. Highlights include reaching more than one million young people (74 per cent women) across 43 markets and raising $78.7 million. Key results show that since 2019, 28,423 young people have entered employment; 5,202 jobs have been created by young entrepreneurs; and 40,615 adolescent girls are more likely to continue in secondary education.\n\nCollective effort is needed to accelerate progress in tackling inequality and promoting economic growth. In 2022, we published insights from our partnership with Unilever supporting over 25,000 small-scale retailers affected by COVID-19 to build more resilient businesses through digitisation. We joined the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office led Girls' Education Skills Partnership alongside 10 other companies, and agreed a partnership with Primark to design solutions to support the financial health of garment sector workers.",

        "page_content": "To inform access to finance solutions for young people, 1,270 young people from 21 markets participated in research conducted with Business Fights Poverty and Cambridge University. The Futuremakers Insights Paper 2022 provided information and data for the third edition of the Futuremakers Forum. More than 1,700 stakeholders from 61 markets participated in this two-day virtual event to hear first-hand from Futuremakers participants, and to explore how to advance inclusive finance.\n\nOver 39 per cent of our colleagues gave back to the community through volunteering in 2022, contributing almost 50,000 days of their time to support worthwhile causes.\n\nOur IGNITE programme aims to unlock the potential of female talent across the Group. In 2022, we partnered with IGNITE to extend this coaching support to Futuremakers participants to help them change, challenge and stretch themselves in pursuit of their goals. In addition, we hosted 12 Mentor's Den sessions across our markets, supporting over 300 young people with strategic advice on personal brand, future skills and banking services. We mobilised our colleagues to support families affected by the floods in Pakistan and increased our provision of three volunteering days annually to five per colleague in the Europe region to help support displaced people from Ukraine.\n\nIn 2023, we will set up a women entrepreneurs' network involving alumni of Futuremakers and expand our women's entrepreneurial support further across our footprint markets. Furthermore, in alignment with our commitment to the UN Principles for Responsible Banking, we will finalise our impact analysis to better understand our broader impact. This work will support us to shape our onwards Futuremakers strategy and further increase employee volunteering support for communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about Futuremakers by Standard Chartered at\n\nsc.com/futuremakers\n\n- Read our Futuremakers impact report at\n\nsc.com/futuremakersimpact\n\n16  World Economic Forum, The Future of Jobs Report 2020, Page 6\n\nThe content contained in the above Sustainability section (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the TCFD disclosures) of this Annual Report is subject to the statements included in (i) the 'Forward-Looking Statements' section; and (ii) the 'Basis of Preparation and Caution Regarding Data Limitations' section provided under 'Important Notices' at page 498.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe directors are required to issue a viability statement regarding the Group, explaining their assessment of the prospects of the Group over an appropriate period of time and state whether they have reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due.\n\nThe directors are to also disclose the period of time for which they have made the assessment and the reason they consider that period to be appropriate.\n\nIn considering the viability of the Group, the directors have assessed the key factors including, but not limited to; inflationary pressures, sovereign downgrades and recession, the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical events likely to affect the Group's business model and strategic plan, future performance, capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity taking into account the emerging risks as well as the principal risks.\n\nThe viability assessment has been made over a period of three years, which the directors consider appropriate as it is within both the Group's strategic planning horizon and, the basis upon which its regulatory capital stress tests are undertaken and is representative of the continuous level of regulatory change affecting the financial services industry. The directors will continue to monitor and consider the appropriateness of this period.\n\nThe directors have reviewed the corporate plan, the output of the Group's formalised process of budgeting and strategic planning. For the 2023 Corporate Plan, the forward-looking cash flows and balances includes the anticipated impact of global interest rates on revenues and inflationary pressure on costs . The corporate plan is evaluated and approved each year by the Board with confirmation from the Group Chief Risk Officer that the Plan is aligned with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Group Risk Appetite Statement and considers the Group's future projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and resources, liquidity ratios and other key financial and regulatory ratios over the period. The corporate plan details the Group's key performance measures, of forecast profit, CET 1 capital ratio forecast, return on tangible equity forecasts, cost to income ratio forecasts and cash investment projections. The Board has reviewed the ongoing performance management process of the Group by comparing the statutory results to the budgets and corporate plan.\n\nThe Group performs enterprise-wide stress tests using a range of bespoke hypothetical scenarios that explore the resilience of the Group to shocks to its balance sheet and business model.\n\nTo assess the Group's balance sheet vulnerabilities and capital and liquidity adequacy, severe but plausible macro-financial scenarios explore shocks that trigger one or more of:\n\n- \u00b7 Global slowdowns including recessions in China, Asian and Western economies that can be acute or more protracted, resulting in severe declines in propertyprices\n- \u00b7 Sharp falls in world trade volumes and disruption to global supply chains, including the severe worsening of trade tensions and rise of protectionism.\n- \u00b7 Inflationary pressures in the global economy including volatility in commodity prices\n- \u00b7 Significant rises in interest rates and depreciation in emerging market currencies, resulting in heightened sovereign risk\n- \u00b7 Financial market volatility, including significant moves in asset prices driven by a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical events\n\nThis year, the primary focus has been on the effects of rising interest rates and inflation, combined with severe market volatility and a global economic downturn. The Group has explored the impact of rising rates and inflation on customers' ability to service debt and considered how net interest income sensitivity evolves under various scenarios.\n\nFor the 2022 ICAAP submission for climate risk, the Group moved towards a more quantitative approach comparing the worst (annualised) five-year loss period from all three NGFS scenarios to the projected peak losses from the 2022 Group ICAAP. The Late Action scenario was identified to drive the maximum difference in losses in a five year period; however, this was lower than losses experienced under the ICAAP macroeconomic stress scenario, concluding that an additional capital add-on was not required for climate risk.\n\nIn 2022, the Group further assessed the impact from Climate risk on our CCIB corporate client portfolio based on three International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios and three Phase 2 NGFS scenarios and participated in the Monetary Authority of Singapore Industry-Wide Stress Test. The impact of sea level rises under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios was used to explore the Physical Risk impact on the Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) residential mortgage portfolio.\n\nUnder this range of scenarios, the results of these stress tests demonstrate that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue as a going concern and meet regulatory minimum capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nTo assess the Group's business model vulnerabilities, extreme and unlikely scenarios are explored that, by design, result in the Group's business model no longer being viable these scenarios have included for the Group extreme geopolitical tensions disrupting capital flows within the Group's footprint and cyber security attacks. Insights from these reverse stress tests can inform strategy, risk management and capital and liquidity planning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on stress testing is provided in the Risk management approach section (page 295).\n\nThe directors further considered the Group's Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liquidity position, its framework and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due. Funding and liquidity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, including the ADR and LCR ratios.\n\nFurther information on stress testing is provided in the Risk management approach section (page 297).\n\nThe Board Risk Committee ('BRC') exercises oversight on behalf of the Board of the key risks of the Group and makes recommendations to the Board on the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. These risks include, amongst others; credit, traded, treasury, operational and technology, reputational and sustainability, compliance, information and cyber security financial crime and model risks. The BRC further exercises oversight over the integrated risks of climate, digital asset and third party which cut across all principal risks.",

Despite the uncertainty, we have made strong progress across our portfolio. This progress is supported by the resilience of the business, which is in turn underpinned by our governance.\n\nGood governance requires an awareness of the landscape, appropriate oversight, and a strong tone from the top, driven by an effective Board. A key focus of the Board this year was managing its own succession, with the loss of a number of very experienced non-executives and the appointment of some excellent replacements, as I mentioned in my statement on pages 7 and 8. I am very conscious that with the retirements of Naguib Kheraj, Byron Grote, Christine Hodgson and Jasmine Whitbread, we lose a wealth of experience and knowledge of the Group. Accordingly, we have accelerated the inductions of our new non-executives who have spent a lot of time with the outgoing non-executives. I was also pleased to welcome Adrian de Souza as Group Company Secretary in May 2022, who takes over from Scott Corrigan's interim tenure and I would like to take the opportunity to thank Scott for his wise counsel. Further detail regarding the changes made to our Board appears in the Governance and Nomination Committee report starting on page 179.\n\nAnother key area of focus was geopolitical risk. The Board received presentations from economists, strategists and geopolitical commentators over a number of Board sessions and dinners. We considered carefully the impact on our business of China-US tensions and the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as those presented by Climate Risks. The conclusions of these sessions helped us challenge and shape our Corporate Plan. In April, we continued\n\nthe strengthening of our risk oversight through the reallocation of the work of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee to a combination of the Board, Board Risk Committee and Audit Committee. The reallocation enables a more integrated review of risks that are closely associated, such as fraud, information and cyber security and financial crime. Financial and non-financial risks continue to receive substantial attention and focus at the Board Risk Committee and Board. In addition, the Audit Committee carefully scrutinised financial reporting matters and internal controls, cognisant of the challenging external environment.\n\nThe Corporate Plan is an important part of the Board's agenda each year and never more than this year, with so many economic and political headwinds. The Board considered a number of strategic opportunities for growth in the context of our risk appetite, receiving presentations from our front-line businesses and risk teams before approving the plan.\n\nThe easing of travel restrictions has meant that I have been able to visit a number of markets and we have additionally held Board meetings in Singapore and Dubai, where we hosted a subsidiary governance conference attended by the chairs of many of our banking subsidiaries. It was a great event and I welcomed the opportunity to engage with so many of my colleagues, both old and new. The Board is planning to visit several countries across our footprint this year as we continue to strengthen the linkages between the main and subsidiary boards. We also were pleased that shareholders could attend our 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in person for the first time since 2019 given the easing of restrictions on public gatherings.\n\nRecognising the impact on society and other stakeholders, the Board sought, and received, shareholder endorsement of our net zero pathway at the 2022 AGM. Market Forces and Friends Provident Foundation filed a resolution outlining a different approach, which did not pass. We appreciate the involvement of both organisations and share their commitment to the transition to net zero, but the Board preferred the Group's strategic approach to achieve this and recommended that shareholders support our advisory resolution and oppose the requisitioned resolution. The Board, whether directly or through our Culture and Sustainability Committee, is regularly apprised of the progress we are making against the commitments in the net zero pathway and continues to be actively involved, and I am pleased that we are meeting the milestones set out in our plan. Further information on this can be found on pages 64 to 124.\n\nI was disappointed with the levels of support for our directors' remuneration policy and directors' remuneration report at last year's AGM, which was the subject of much Board and Remuneration Committee discussion. I am grateful to Christine for leading the engagement with many of our shareholders to better understand their views. This resulted in the updates announced in September which are detailed, along with the extensive engagement undertaken by the Committee, in the Directors' Remuneration Report starting on page 184.\n\nThe Board was heartened by the results of the externally facilitated effectiveness review of the Board and its committees. It assessed the Board's progress since the last external review in 2019 and concluded that the Board continues to operate effectively while also identifying some areas for improvement. More detail on process, outcomes and actions can be found on page 156.\n\nFinally, the Board remains confident for the Group's future and is committed to our strategy, our purpose, and is laser focused on developing sustained and sustainable returns within our risk appetite.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our Board meetings\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining a comprehensive schedule of meetings and a forward agenda to ensure its time is used most effectively and efficiently, and is supported by the Group Company Secretary to facilitate this. Flexibility in the programme is important and permits key items to be added to any agenda so that the Board can focus on evolving and important matters at the most appropriate time.\n\nPerformance against delivery of the agreed key financial priorities is reviewed at every scheduled meeting, with particular reference to the detailed Group management accounts. The Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer comment on current trading, business performance, the market, colleagues, relevant stakeholders, and regulatory and external developments at each scheduled meeting, and present comparative data and client insight. In addition, the Group Chief Risk Officer periodically attends meetings to update the Board on key risks.\n\nThe Group Chairman holds INED-only meetings ahead of each scheduled Board meeting, which provides the opportunity for discussion on key agenda items and other matters without the executive directors and management present.\n\n## Development of Board activities in 2022\n\nGiven the easing of travel restrictions during 2022, the Board and its committees were pleased to hold a greater number of in-person meetings than seen in the previous couple of years. However, as a global Board that reflects our diverse footprint, some directors continued to face challenges with travel, and as such it was important to continue to utilise interactive technology where required.\n\nSir Iain Lobban and Paul Khoo, who are engaged by the Board to act as independent advisers to the Board and its committees on cyber security and cyber threat management, and financial crime respectively, attended a combination of Board and committee meetings to provide an independent and current view on the Group's progress in this area. The Board continue to find Sir Ian's and Paul's inputs valuable and renewed their appointments for a further 12 months.\n\n## Our Board committees\n\nThe Board places significant reliance on its committees by delegating a broad range of responsibilities and issues to them. It therefore remains crucial that effective linkages are in place between the committees and the Board as a whole, not least as it is impracticable for all INEDs to be members of all of the committees. Mechanisms are in place to facilitate these linkages, including ensuring that there are no gaps or unnecessary duplications between the remit of each committee and overlapping membership between Board committees where necessary. Alongside interconnected committee membership, the Board receives a written summary of each of the committee's meetings and verbal updates at the Board, where appropriate.\n\nFurther details on each committee, including their oversight and focus during 2022, can be found in the Board committee reports starting on page 163.\n\nAs in previous years, the most appropriate format for each Board and committee meeting was assessed by the Group Chairman or respective committee chair, with support from the Group Company Secretary, to ensure inclusivity and agility and to protect authentic engagement. This resulted in some meetings being held in person, virtually or a combination of the two. Irrespective of location and time zone, each director was able to interact effectively with other attendees.\n\nThe timeline on this page shows the Board's collective engagement throughout the year.\n\n## Board activities during 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Director induction\n\nThree new directors were appointed to the Board during the year. Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt possess a range of skills and a breadth of knowledge relevant to the Board debate. Details regarding their experience can be found in their biographies on pages 139 to 141.\n\nAll new Board members are given a comprehensive, formalised induction programme. Prior to taking up their respective Board and committee positions, the three new directors were provided with a number of induction sessions to ensure a smooth transition into their roles and positive contributions from the outset. In addition, Shirish Apte and Maria Ramos received in-depth handovers from Christine Hodgson and Naguib Kheraj before succeeding them as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Board Risk Committee respectively. This included a period of shadowing Christine Hodgson and Naguib Kheraj through discussions and meetings in the lead-up to becoming committee chairs. Phil Rivett was appointed interim Board Risk Committee Chair following the retirement of Naguib Kheraj and pending Maria Ramos' appointment as Chair receiving regulatory approval. He was actively involved in the handover process for Maria Ramos.\n\nWhile a proportion of the induction is relevant to all new Board members, the content of the programme is tailored to meet each director's individual level of experience and expertise. Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt participated or will participate in deep-dive sessions on a number of key topics. Examples include: the role and responsibilities of a director; our strategic priorities; the critical enablers and the Stands; the markets in which we operate; client groups and product segments and principal risks. In addition, learning and development sessions have taken place or have been arranged to ensure they are well versed with the significant issues unique to each of their committee memberships.\n\nEach induction typically consists of a combination of meetings with existing Board members and senior staff. New Board members are also given the opportunity to attend key management meetings and engage with stakeholders, including investors and clients. Visits to key markets across our footprint were limited due to the variation of travel restrictions but opened up as the year progressed. As such, there was a combination of in person and virtual engagements.\n\nLinda Yueh joined the Board on 1 January 2023; her experience can be found in her biography on page 142. She has made good progress in respect to her induction plan so far this year, visiting two of our markets.\n\nThe Group Corporate Secretariat function supports the INEDs as they undertake their induction programmes, which are typically completed within the first six to nine months of an INED appointment and progress is reviewed by the Governance and Nomination Committee after six months. The programmes are regularly reviewed and take into account directors' feedback to ensure continuous development and improvement.\n\n## Ongoing development plans\n\nContinuous training and development beyond a director's induction plan is essential to maintaining a highly engaged, effective and well-informed Board. Ongoing development plans also help ensure directors lead with integrity and promote the Group's culture, purpose and values.\n\nMandatory learning and training are important elements of directors' fitness and propriety assessments as required under the Senior Managers Regime. During the year, all directors received a combination of mandatory learning and training, internal and external briefings, presentations from guest speakers, and papers on a wide range of topics to ensure the directors are well informed and that the Board remains highly effective. The Board committee members also received specific training relevant to the work of their respective committees. The format of ongoing training varied, including formal refresher sessions and informal meetings. The training covered a variety of topics throughout the year and were held either in person, virtually or a combination of the two. The table on the next page gives further detail on who received these briefings.\n\nThe Group Chairman reviews with each director their training and development needs both in real time and as part of the annual performance cycle. Where it is recognised that the Board or individual directors need further training or development in key areas, additional sessions are arranged with subject matter experts.\n\nAll of the directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary, who provides support to the Board and is responsible for advising the Board on governance matters. Directors also have access to independent, professional advice at the Group's expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as directors.",

Certain training sessions took place after these dates\n- 5 Director attendance was not mandatory\n\n## Directors' performance\n\nThe Group Chairman led the evaluation of individual director performance during 2022. These one-to-one sessions considered:\n\n- \u00b7 their performance against core competencies and their individual effectiveness\n- \u00b7 their time commitment to the Group, including (where relevant) the potential impact of any outside interests\n- \u00b7 their ongoing development and training needs\n- \u00b7 the Board's composition, taking into account when each INED envisaged stepping down from the Board\n- \u00b7 the current and future committee membership and structure\n- \u00b7 their engagement across the Group.\n\nThese performance reviews are used as the basis for recommending the re-election of directors by shareholders at the 2023 AGM and to assist the Group Chairman with his assessment of the INEDs' competencies. In addition, the Group Chairman has responsibility for assessing annually the fitness and propriety of the Company's INEDs and the Group Chief Executive Officer under the Senior Managers Regime. These assessments were carried out in respect of each INED and the Group Chief Executive and no issues in relation to fitness and propriety were identified.\n\n- Director attended the session\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Director did not attend the session but received any accompanying material and had opportunities to raise questions and observations with the Group Chairman and Group Company Secretary\n\n## Group Chairman's performance\n\nMaria Ramos, as Senior Independent Director, assisted by Christine Hodgson, who was Senior Independent Director for part of the year, and Ffion Hague, who facilitated the Board evaluation this year, reviewed Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als' performance as Group Chairman. Consolidated feedback was shared with him.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOur INEDs commit sufficient time in discharging their responsibilities as directors of Standard Chartered. In general, we estimate that each INED spent approximately 40 to 70 days on Board-related duties, and considerably more for those who chair or are members of multiple committees.",

What drew you to Standard Chartered and how do your initial impressions align to your expectations?\n\nA. As an entrepreneur at heart, I was delighted with the opportunity to join a global bank that serves businesses that promote trade and innovation and puts clients at the heart of everything they do. Standard Chartered's drive to be diverse and inclusive as well as giving back to communities in which they work was also a big draw, particularly as these are important concepts I've championed throughout my career. Since joining Standard Chartered in July my initial impressions have been great. I've enjoyed getting to know my colleagues, as well as other stakeholders, and the Board's visit to Dubai in November is a good example of this. We were hosted by an excellent team who ran a comprehensive agenda and were very welcoming.\n\n## Q. How effective have you found your induction programme in preparing you as an INED and for the Standard Chartered Board and committee discussions?\n\nA. My induction programme has been very useful so far and has covered a broad range of different topics relevant to my role. I've also engaged with members of our leadership team across the Group who've provided valuable insight into their roles, the business and the functions. As part of the programme, I recently visited Malaysia and Singapore, along with two of my fellow new directors. This was a fascinating experience where I spoke to many different people from across the business, including our colleagues in the Global Business Service centre, Malaysia as well as our partners in Singapore who work on our digital banking solutions. I was really encouraged to see how focused everyone is on driving the client experience and supporting the younger demographic. I'm looking forward to the remainder of the induction process.\n\n## Q. What are the key skills and experience you bring to the Board?\n\nA. I've thoroughly enjoyed my executive and nonexecutive roles over the years at organisations such as JP Morgan, UK Government Investments, Nordea Bank Abp, M&G plc, Ashurst LLP and Aon PLC. I'm truly thankful for the opportunities and great experiences these roles have provided, which have helped deepen my comprehensive knowledge across global markets and the financial, regulatory and governance landscape more broadly. I enjoy acting as a sounding board and helping to problem-solve on many issues, as well as having the chance to get to know the teams with whom I have worked. I believe very strongly in being respectful to everyone and embracing inclusivity. Whilst I seek to improve diversity in all aspects, I have chosen to focus on gender. This has been important to me throughout my career, and I feel it's crucial for women to empower and support each other. In addition, I think that mentoring and reverse mentoring are critical and I am happy to say that I have just been assigned a colleague in Hong Kong as my first reverse mentor and I am learning loads.\n\n## Q. How important is a company's culture to you and what are your views on the culture at Standard Chartered?\n\nA. This is incredibly important. In my experience a company that focuses on embedding the right behaviours, and taking actions to make this culture a reality, will have a better chance at achieving success in the long-term. I'm impressed by how many people at Standard Chartered are invested in delivering on the Group's ambitions through collaboration and innovation, while continuing to strengthen an inclusive, high performance, risk-aware culture.\n\n## Q. How do you build connections with key stakeholders?\n\nA. I believe respect, empathy and a steely determination to do the right thing are key ingredients in building connections and relationships. We have a wealth of stakeholders to consider at Standard Chartered, including clients, suppliers, colleagues, shareholders, regulators and the communities in which we operate. Listening and responding to their priorities and concerns is so important and helps to deliver on our strategic priorities. As I mentioned before, diversity and inclusion are important to me. Earlier in my career I set up an annual women's networking event which has really grown over the years. I now host this more regularly and I'm delighted by the high turnout and enthusiasm to support one another.\n\n## Q. What do you see as some of the key priorities for Standard Chartered over the next 5 years?\n\nA. This is an important aspect of the Board's agenda, and we discuss this with management in depth. I believe continuing to put clients at the heart of all that we do to be vital, as well as developing our talent and youth, aiming to increase shareholder returns, giving back to the communities and environments in which we operate, maintaining a risk aware strategy, and leveraging off our diverse and unique network.",

        "page_content": "## Board effectiveness\n\nThis year, the Board Effectiveness Review comprised an externally facilitated evaluation in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. It was conducted by Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation (IBE). The Board's five committees were also observed as part of the review. Neither Ffion Hague nor IBE has any other connection with the Company or any individual directors. This was the third external evaluation the Board has undertaken during Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als' tenure as Group Chairman.\n\n## Board effectiveness review format\n\nA comprehensive brief was provided to the assessment team at IBE by the Group Chairman and the assessment team observed the Board and its committees between July and October. The review took the form of detailed interviews with every board member, members from the Management Team and other key non-board contributors, some 26 people in total. All participants were interviewed thoroughly in accordance with a tailored agenda. The evaluation team also observed Board and committee meetings, reviewed papers from these meetings, as well as more static documentation provided.\n\nA report was compiled by the evaluation team based on the information and views supplied by those interviewed and observations from the Board and committee meetings. Draft conclusions were discussed with the Group Chairman and subsequently the whole board in December 2022, with Ffion Hague present. Following the Board discussion, IBE provided feedback to each committee chair on the performance of their committee and also discussed the report on the Group Chairman's performance with the current and previous Senior Independent Director.\n\nIn addition, the Group Chairman received a report with feedback on individual directors which was used to support the individual Fit and Proper and annual assessments conducted with directors. Key observations were discussed by the Governance and Nomination Committee ahead of the Board and its committees finalising their 2023 action plans. Key observations and action plans for the Board's five committees can be found in the Board committee reports starting on page 163.\n\n## External evaluation process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvaluation brief provided to IBE\n\nBoard and committees observed\n\nEvaluation and report prepared\n\nObservations discussed with the Group Chairman, Governance and Nomination Committee, Board and committee chairs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAction plans for 2023 agreed with Board and committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne-to-one interviews conducted\n\n## Progress against the 2022 Action Plan\n\nThe 2022 Action Plan set out a number of actions to be achieved following the internal Board evaluation conducted in 2021. The 2022 Action Plan was regularly reviewed during the year and good progress had been made against actions as evidenced by this year's external Board effectiveness review.\n\n## Key observations from the 2022 external effectiveness review\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has shown considerable progress since the last external evaluation and believes in continuous improvement.\n- \u00b7 The Board is regarded as well constructed overall, with plenty of listed experience and good diversity ratios, although slightly larger than most market peers.\n- \u00b7 The Board considered the importance of creating more space on the Board agendas and creating a mechanism to take papers by exception.\n- \u00b7 That the standard tenure of INEDs needed further consideration in order to smooth succession.\n\n## 2023 Action Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Review agendas of the Board and its committees to reduce overlaps and create efficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Revise key performance indicators and regular reports to focus attention on outcomes rather than activity and completed steps.\n- \u00b7 Enhance peer benchmarking information and data.\n- \u00b7 Improve INED appointment process by increasing pace of recruitment and decision making.\n- \u00b7 Clarify the timetable and those responsible for Board appointments within that framework.\n- \u00b7 Enhance new director induction packs to assist them in understanding how strategy, risk appetite and the organisation fit together.\n- \u00b7 Rebalance the Board agendas to create more time for linked strategic discussions.\n- \u00b7 Review the mechanism for Board workforce engagement.\n- \u00b7 Enhance the framework for ensuring reputational risk is appropriately escalated to the Board and its committees.",

        "page_content": "## Director independence\n\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee reviews the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into account any circumstances likely to impair, or which could impair, their independence. Recommendations are then made to the Board for further consideration.\n\nIn determining the independence of a non-executive director, the Board considers each individual against the criteria set out in the UK Code, the Hong Kong Listing Rules and also considers their contribution and conduct at Board meetings, including how they demonstrate objective judgement and independent thinking.\n\nThe Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent of Standard Chartered, concluding that there are no relationships or circumstances likely to impair any INEDs' judgement.\n\n## Christine Hodgson independence\n\nAt the request of the Company, Christine, who had signalled her intention to retire from the Board at the end of her nine-year term as an independent non-executive director in September 2022, agreed to remain on the Board until 31 January 2023. This enabled Christine to facilitate the orderly transition of her role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee to her successor, Shirish Apte, as well as lead the shareholder consultation required following a significant minority vote against the Company's remuneration policy and report resolutions at the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Board, taking into account the provisions set out in the UK Code and the Hong Kong Listing Rules, considered Christine independent up until she stepped down from the Board despite her serving for a period of more than nine years and concluded that there were no relationships or circumstances likely to impair her judgement. This was based on a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Christine's strong record in making objective decisions and holding management to account and remaining willing and able to do so\n- \u00b7 her clear independence demonstrated in terms of her participation at meetings with management and her interactions with shareholders and proxy agencies\n- \u00b7 her arm's-length approach to dealing with executive directors and continued challenge where appropriate\n- \u00b7 none of Christine's external directorship appointments conflicted or potentially conflicted with those of the Company\n- \u00b7 the broader composition of the Board, including the fact that no other director had a tenure in excess of nine years.\n\n## External directorships and other business interests\n\nBoard members hold external directorships and other outside business interests. We recognise the significant benefits that broader boardroom exposure provides for our directors. However, we closely monitor the nature and quantity of external directorships our directors hold, in order to satisfy ourselves that any additional appointments will not adversely impact their time commitment to their role at Standard Chartered, and to ensure that all of our Board members remain compliant with the PRA directorship requirements, as well as the shareholder advisory groups' individual guidance on 'over-boarding'. These requirements impose a limit on the number of directorships both executive and INEDs are permitted to hold.\n\nDetails of the directors' external directorships can be found in their biographies on pages 138 to 142. Before committing to an additional appointment, directors confirm the existence of any potential or actual conflicts, that the role will not breach their limit as set out by the PRA, and provide the necessary assurance that the appointment will not adversely impact their ability to continue to fulfil their role as a director of the Company. All directors continue to hold no more than the maximum number of directorships permitted under the PRA rules.\n\nOur established internal processes ensure that directors do not undertake any new external appointments without first receiving formal approval of the Board. The Board has delegated authority to make such approvals to the Group Chairman, with the exception of his own appointments. Of those INEDs who took on new external directorships during the year, four were regarded as significant directorships (appointed to the board of a listed company) and as such were announced to the market in line with our listing obligations. Further detail on the specific appointments are provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Gay Huey Evans was appointed to the board of S&P Global as a non-executive director and member of its audit committee on 28 February 2022, following the closing of the merger between S&P Global and IHS Markit. Gay resigned as an independent director of IHS Markit on the same day\n- \u00b7 Carlson Tong was appointed to the board of MTR Corporation Limited as an independent non-executive director, chairman of its audit and risk committee and a member of its finance and investment committee on 25 May 2022\n- \u00b7 Byron Grote was appointed to the board of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) as a nonexecutive director and member of its audit and remuneration committees on 1 July 2022\n- \u00b7 Jackie Hunt will join the Board of Willis Towers Watson plc (WTW) as an independent non-executive director on 1 April 2023.\n\nAll four directors discussed their respective appointments with the Group Chairman in advance of accepting the positions. Each director confirmed the existence of any potential or actual conflicts; provided assurance that the respective roles would not breach their limits as set out by the PRA; and confirmed that their appointments would not impact their abilities to devote sufficient time and focus to both their Board and committee responsibilities.\n\nThe Board's executive directors are permitted to hold only one non-executive directorship. Of our executive directors, Andy Halford, was until 31 December 2022, the Senior Independent Director, Chair of the Audit Committee and member of the Nomination Committee at Marks and Spencer Group plc, listed on the FTSE 250 and Bill Winters is a non-executive director of Novartis International AG, listed on SIX Swiss Exchange.",

It forms a crucial part of Board decisions and discussions, as well as the review of our purpose, values and strategy.\n\nAs the impact of COVID-19 started to lessen across many of our markets, overseas travel was gradually reintroduced during the year. This was an opportunity for directors, either collectively or individually, to engage in person with a wide range of stakeholders, some for the first time since early 2020.\n\n## Ensuring authentic engagement across our markets\n\nSome of our markets continued to face COVID-19-related restrictions during 2022, particularly in the early stages. Certain visits were either limited or replaced with virtual engagements. Dialogue via interactive technology ensured authentic engagement, but did at times prevent the meeting engagement the Board would usually undertake if it were in-person. Despite this, the Board is aware that a combination of both virtual and in-person meetings is an effective way of driving stakeholder engagement as it provides flexibility and the opportunity to tailor interactions depending on the participants.\n\nRegardless of the format, Board activities led to a number of invaluable opportunities to engage with stakeholders across the Group's diverse network, including those identified on the following pages. Directors did not just engage collectively with stakeholders, but also individually. Independent adviser members to the Board, Board Risk Committee and Audit Committee also engaged directly with them.\n\nInformal and formal sessions with stakeholders across our footprint help provide INEDs and independent  adviser members with a comprehensive understanding of the Group's market operations, implementation of strategy, and the external and internal impact of the Group's activities.\n\nFurther detail regarding the Board's engagement with our stakeholders can be found on the following pages. Detail regarding how Board Committees and their members engaged with stakeholders can be found in the committee report sections starting from page 163.\n\nMembers of the Board, Management Team, directors from the Group's banking subsidiaries and other colleagues during a market visit to Dubai in November 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with investors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach\n\nAiming to deliver robust returns and long-term, sustainable value for shareholders is of key importance to the Board. We continuously reflect on how the Board engages with our investors, openly seeking feedback and reviewing previous activities. We believe this strengthens engagements and helps support the Board's focus on developing open and trusted relationships with investors.\n\nAlthough travel restrictions in some markets limited in-person engagement at times, the Board was able to physically meet with shareholders on a number of occasions. Where directors could not meet with shareholders in person, a virtual approach was taken. As with last year, this provided the opportunity to participate in events where extensive travel may have restricted investors in the past.\n\nDuring the year, we maintained a comprehensive programme of engagement, including investor advisory bodies and credit rating agencies, and provided updates on progress made to transform our business for improved returns.\n\nThe Group Chairman and other Board directors had direct contact with investors and advisory voting bodies during the year, and received regular updates from the Investor Relations team, including reports on market and investor sentiment. An external independent investor perception study was commissioned, which was then considered by the Board. The Group Chairman, as part of his role, leads engagement with shareholders and hosted the 2022 AGM alongside fellow Board members. The Group Chairman and certain Board members also held an investor stewardship event similar to last year.\n\nChristine Hodgson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee up until 31 December 2022, led the shareholder consultation required following a significant minority vote against the Company directors' remuneration policy and report resolutions at the 2022 AGM. Maria Ramos took over from Christine Hodgson as Senior Independent Director in September 2022. The Senior Independent Director was available to shareholders if they had concerns that could not be resolved or for which the normal channels were inappropriate.\n\nBill Winters and Andy Halford are the primary spokespeople for the Group. Throughout the year they engaged extensively with existing shareholders and potential new investors during individual or group meetings and conferences, either in person or virtually. In addition, each member of the Management Team responsible for a client segment or a geographic region, as well as the Group Treasurer, engaged with investors\n\nto promote greater awareness and understanding of the strategy in their respective areas, as well as taking the opportunity to receive investor feedback first hand.\n\n## Institutional shareholders\n\nThe Group maintains a diverse, high-quality and predominantly institutional shareholder base. The Investor Relations team has primary responsibility for managing day-to-day communications with these shareholders and provides support to the Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, other Board members and senior management in conducting a comprehensive engagement programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresentation material and webcast transcripts are made available on the Group's website and can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n## Investor stewardship event\n\nThe Group Chairman hosted a stewardship event in November 2022 alongside the Senior Independent Director and chairs of the Board Risk, Audit, and Remuneration Committees. Given the easing of travel restrictions in the UK, the event was held as a hybrid meeting which offered flexibility regarding how investors could engage. The Group Chairman provided a strategic update regarding Board and committee activities during the year which was supplemented by opening remarks from the Remuneration Committee Chair. This was followed by a question and answer (Q&A) session. Questions could be submitted in advance of the event, asked live in person or via a webbased platform for those who joined electronically.\n\n## Debt investors and credit rating agencies\n\nOur Debt Investor Relations team has primary responsibility for managing the Group's relationships with debt investors and the three major rating agencies, with local market chief executives and chief financial officers leading on smaller subsidiary ratings. In 2022, management met with debt investors across Europe, North America and Asia, and maintained a regular dialogue with the rating agencies.\n\nIt is important that the Group, as an active issuer of senior unsecured and non-equity capital, maintains regular contact with debt investors to ensure continued appetite for the Group's credit. The Group's credit ratings are a key part of the external perception of our financial strength and creditworthiness.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We were pleased that shareholders could attend in person for the first time since 2019 given the easing of restrictions on public gatherings. In addition, in light of the success of last year's digitally enabled meeting, we also offered shareholders the opportunity to participate electronically via a live web-portal. Within this portal, shareholders were able to view a live video feed of the AGM, submit voting instructions and questions in writing or ask them through an audio line. Shareholders who attended the meeting in person were able to submit voting instructions and ask questions directly.\n\nThe AGM is a key date in the Board's calendar and the hybrid format ensured that shareholders could engage with them regarding the Company's recent performance and strategic priorities. Questions received from shareholders covered a diverse range of topics, including climate and the Group's net zero pathway; diversity; the Group's strategy; shareholder engagement; share price and regulatory developments.\n\n## Engagement with clients and suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClients are central to everything we do and promoting productive, sustainable relationships with them is a key priority. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, customer engagement was built into Board and director visits across our footprint and given the alleviation of travel restrictions in certain markets, this method of interaction was gradually reintroduced during the year. Board members, either collectively or individually, met clients face-to-face or virtually to keep abreast of developing client trends, experiences and needs. This also formed and will continue to form a part of the director induction programme. In addition, updates on clients' insights form part of deep dives into product segment strategy at Board meetings.\n\nSuppliers provide efficient and sustainable goods and services for our business and certain members of the Board also met with them during the year. Detail on how the Group more generally engaged with clients and suppliers can be found on pages 55, 56, 58 and 59 of the Strategic report.\n\nAll Board-proposed resolutions were passed, with shareholder support for each ranging from 68.81 per cent to 100 per cent. We proposed our net zero pathway as a shareholder advisory resolution at the AGM. Market Forces and Friends Provident Foundation filed a resolution outlining a different approach. The Board appreciate the involvement of both of these organisations and share their commitment to the transition to net zero, however the Board supported the Group's strategic approach to achieve this and recommended that shareholders support our advisory resolution and oppose the requisitioned resolution. In line with the Board's recommendation the advisory resolution was endorsed with 83 per cent of shareholder support at the 2022 AGM, and the requisitioned resolution did not pass. We remain very grateful for the support of our shareholders.\n\nDetail regarding the directors' remuneration report and directors remuneration policy resolutions can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report starting on page 184.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVoting results from the 2022 AGM can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\nA summary of responses to questions on key themes raised by shareholders was made available on our website after the meeting and can be found at sc.com/agm\n\n## Engagement with regulators and governments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board, either collectively or individually, engages with relevant authorities both in the UK and across our footprint on a regular basis. During 2022, this took place via a number of virtual and physical forums. Topics varied, including recovery from the pandemic, geopolitical developments, resolution planning, digitisation and innovation, climate-related matters and cyber security. Certain regulators attended Board meetings during the year, which provided the opportunity to discuss key items and developments. Further detail on how the Group engaged with regulators and governments more generally can be found on page 57 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Engagement with society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from management concerning the communities and environment in which we operate.\n\nEither collectively or individually, directors were able to visit some of the Group's markets this year given the easing of travel restrictions in certain markets. This provided a productive opportunity to meet stakeholders in civil society. In addition, external and internal speakers provided input to the Board's discussions, which covered key societal issues such as climate change, the evolving geopolitical landscape, and the continued impact of the pandemic in some of our markets. Further detail on how the Group engaged with society more generally can be found on page 59.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information can be viewed at sc.com/investors",

        "page_content": "## Engagement and linkages with the Group's subsidiaries\n\nThe Board and its committees recognise the importance of creating, maintaining and building upon appropriate linkages with the Group's subsidiaries. Similar to 2021, the Board's ability to physically meet with people from across the Group's footprint remained limited. Despite this, the Group Chairman and INEDs engaged with the Group's subsidiaries through a number of forums. This included video-enabled chair and committee chair engagement sessions, as well as other forms of interaction.\n\n## Global subsidiary governance conference\n\nDuring the Board's visit to Dubai in November, we held our third global subsidiary governance conference. This two-day event was attended by members of the Board, Management Team and directors from the Group's banking subsidiaries. The conference presented the opportunity for the Board to strengthen and reconnect its linkages with the Group's subsidiary chairs, hear their views on the progress of the Group's strategy and discuss what improvements could be made in their markets, as well as a range of other topics. It also enabled the Board and Management Team to gain a better appreciation of some of the challenges and opportunities the Group faces across its subsidiary markets. Items discussed across the two days included:\n\nThe Group Chairman also hosted two subsidiary chair engagement sessions during 2022, both held virtually. Each event opened with specific topics introduced by the Group Chairman, followed by a Q&A session. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als was encouraged by the high level of interaction and sharing of best practices by our subsidiary chairs. Items discussed across the sessions included:\n\n- \u00b7 Group performance, strategy and investor reaction\n- \u00b7 2022 Board priorities\n- \u00b7 UK Corporate Governance update\n- \u00b7 New ways of working for certain markets post COVID-19\n- \u00b7 Areas of focus for the Group's boards, including board transformation and overseeing culture\n- \u00b7 Sustainability.\n\n## Committee chair engagement\n\nThe Audit Committee held its annual videoconference during the year, followed by a Q&A session. This was hosted by the Audit Committee Chair and attended by the chairs of subsidiary audit committees. The Group Financial Controller; Group Head, Internal Audit; Regional Head, Audit, Europe and the Americas and Africa and the Middle East; Group Head, Conduct, Financial Crime and Compliance; members of the Group's statutory auditor, EY, including the lead audit partner; the Group Company Secretary and the Committee Secretary also participated in the call. Items discussed during the call included:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 Audit Committee focus areas\n- \u00b7 Group Finance update, which featured financial results, IFRS 9 models, overlays and a status report on the Group's Aspire Programme\n- \u00b7 Conduct, financial crime and compliance update\n- \u00b7 Group Internal Audit reporting to subsidiary audit committees\n- \u00b7 Group statutory audit update from EY.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee Chair hosted its annual videoconference with chairs of the subsidiary board risk committees, followed by a Q&A session. The Group Chairman; Group Chief Risk Officer; Global Head of Enterprise Risk Management and Deputy Chief Risk Officer Standard Chartered Bank; the Group Company Secretary and Committee Secretary also participated in the call.\n\n- \u00b7 Group strategy, financial performance and governance structure\n- \u00b7 The transformation taking place in the UAE from a policy perspective\n- \u00b7 Regional CEOs strategy session\n- \u00b7 Building resilient business models and ecosystems for the new economy\n- \u00b7 Strategic oversight of sustainability\n- \u00b7 Talent opportunity and changing workforce expectations\n- \u00b7 Overview of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Fintech hive.\n\nItems discussed during the call included:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 Board Risk Committee focus areas\n- \u00b7 Group Chief Risk Officer's 2022 priorities\n- \u00b7 Update on Model Risk\n- \u00b7 Management scenarios undertaken during the year, including stagflation.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee Chair also held a videoconference attended by the subsidiary remuneration committee chairs and the chairs of subsidiary boards that have remuneration responsibilities. The Group Chairman; members of the Remuneration Committee; Group Head, Human Resources; Global Head, Performance, Reward and Benefits; Head, Executive Compensation and Reward Governance; the regional, functional and business heads of Pensions, Rewards and Benefits; and the Group Company Secretary also participated in the call. The calls foster knowledge sharing and best practice between the Company Remuneration Committee and the subsidiary remuneration committees and raise awareness as remuneration committees are increasingly expected to have oversight over the approach to remuneration for the wider workforce. The topics that were discussed included:\n\n- \u00b7 2022 Remuneration Committee focus areas\n- \u00b7 Framework for subsidiary interaction\n- \u00b7 2022 total variable compensation and ensuring strong differentiation\n- \u00b7 2023 compensation in light of inflation and cost of living pressures.\n\nOther activities which took place during 2022 to further strengthen the linkages across the Group included:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group Chairman attended a Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (SCBHK) board meeting\n- \u00b7 the Chair of the Group Audit Committee attended a SCBHK audit committee meeting and the audit committee chair of Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Limited attended one Group Audit Committee Meeting\n- \u00b7 the Chair of the Board Risk Committee attended a SCBHK board risk committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail regarding how the Group engages with its stakeholders can be found on pages 54 to 124",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board places great importance on workforce engagement and values its interactions at all levels of the Group. Two-way dialogue through a variety of forums helps build the Board's understanding of key issues and developments around its markets, as well as providing an insight into the hands-on experiences of colleagues.\n\nThe role of the Board is distinct from management, and the directors are aware of the importance of overseeing, supporting and, where necessary, challenging management in implementing its people strategy. In light of this, the Board tasked the Culture and Sustainability Committee to oversee a review of the existing framework with management, considering certain adjustments aimed to enhance the Board workforce engagement.\n\nThe Board continued to adopt an alternative approach to the workforce engagement methods set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The primary reason for taking a different approach was that, as a global organisation with more than 83,000 employees across 59 diverse markets, it is vital that any Board engagement should gather unfiltered feedback which is representative of the whole workforce in order to be truly effective.\n\nGiven the easing of travel restrictions the Board was able to meet colleagues across parts of our footprint, both collectively and individually. The diagram below illustrates which markets were visited. During the year, directors appreciated being able to meet face-to-face with a number of employees, whether through formal meetings or informal discussions. The opportunity to resume meeting the workforce in person is something directors found highly beneficial and will continue to form part of the approach for 2023.\n\nThrough our comprehensive employee listening programme, the Board has an opportunity to understand diverse employee perspectives. This is comprised of an annual engagement survey, a continuous listening programme, lifecycle surveys and diagnostic research on specific areas of focus, such as flexible working, wellbeing and performance management. The Board can also access data on employee issues through our Speak Up channel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail regarding employee engagement this year can be found within the Culture and Sustainability Committee report starting on page 176\n\n## Director travel: an opportunity to engage with the workforce and other stakeholders\n\nDirectors, either together or individually, visited a range of markets.\n\n## Europe and the Americas\n\n- 1. France\n- 2. Germany\n- 3. UK\n- 4. US\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Africa and Middle East\n\n- 5. Kenya\n- 6. Qatar\n- 7. Saudi Arabia\n- 8. UAE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asia\n\n- 9. Bangladesh\n- 10.

Vietnam\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dubai, UAE\n\nOn 10 November, the Board hosted an informal lunch with the UAE talent. They invited a number of top talents who came from various business segments, support functions and backgrounds, representing the diversity of the UAE franchise. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als and Maria Ramos also hosted a townhall for all employees, alongside members of the Management Team.\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe Board travelled to Singapore in March 2022. Although pandemic-related restrictions on social gatherings remained in place, which limited the amount of engagement permitted, the Board took advantage of meeting with a wide range of stakeholders where possible, including informal discussions with senior leaders and other colleagues.",

Sir Iain Lobban and Paul Khoo, independent advisers to the Board, attend discussions on Financial Crime Compliance (FCC)-related matters. As part of his induction plan in 2022, Shirish Apte attended one Committee meeting as an observer prior to joining.\n\nAs part of, and in addition to most scheduled Committee meetings, the Committee held private members-only meetings. The Committee also met with the Group's Statutory Auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY) and the Group Head, Internal Audit, without management being present. The Committee members have detailed and relevant experience and bring an independent mindset to their role.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that Phil Rivett has recent and relevant financial experience. Phil is a chartered accountant with over forty years' experience of professional accountancy and audit focused on banks and insurance companies. He led the audits of a number of leading banks during his career as senior audit partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). He is also Chair of the Audit Committee for Nationwide Building Society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiographical details of the committee members can be viewed on pages 138 to 142\n\n## What are the main responsibilities of the Committee?\n\nThe Committee is responsible for oversight and advice to the Board on matters relating to financial reporting. The Committee's role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the Group's internal controls, including internal financial controls. The Committee has exercised oversight of the work undertaken by Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance (CFCC), Group Internal Audit (GIA) and EY. The Committee Chair reports to the Board on the Committee's key areas of focus following each meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2022. The report sets out the areas of significant focus for the Committee and its activities over the course of the year. I have enjoyed working with Committee members, management, EY, regulators and colleagues, in what has been a strong year of performance for the Group.\n\nThere have been some changes to the Committee's composition in 2022. We welcomed Shirish Apte and Jackie Hunt as Committee members in May and October respectively. Dr Byron Grote stepped down as a Committee member in November, and I would like to convey the Committee's gratitude to Byron for his significant contributions over the years. Paul Day, Group Head, Internal Audit, joined the Committee as a permanent invitee, replacing the previous incumbent.\n\nAs you would expect, the challenging external environment and lingering impacts of COVID-19 have been significant focus areas for the Committee this year. The Committee has carefully scrutinised and challenged credit impairment provisions, including the continued appropriateness or release of COVID-19-related overlays, key accounting issues and significant accounting estimates and judgements made by management, to ensure that they are sufficient, appropriate and clearly communicated in the Group's public disclosures. The Group's investment in China Bohai Bank (Bohai) has continued to be an area warranting ongoing attention, including the assumptions and judgements made around the Group's significant influence over Bohai; and further impairment of the investment to reflect the challenges and uncertainty in the outlook for the banking industry and property markets in China. China Commercial Real Estate (CRE) has been reviewed, discussed and challenged throughout the year, in light of the Chinese economy and the continued impacts of COVID-19. Sovereign downgrades have also been reviewed and discussed, including Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Ghana. Given the complex external landscape, this level of scrutiny will continue in 2023.\n\nThe Committee has continued to place oversight on the Group's Conduct Programme and the Group's Speak Up Programme. We observed regulatory developments in the use of private communication channels and the actions under way by management to protect the Group against the associated risks. The Committee invested time and attention in scrutinising Standard Chartered Bank's implementation plans for Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Consumer Duty, which comes into effect on 31 July 2023. In 2022, I was appointed as the FCA Consumer Duty Board Champion. As part of this role, I meet regularly with the Accountable Executive and receive monthly updates on the progress of the implementation plans, whereby I then update the Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive, as required.\n\nGiven the retirement of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee on 1 April 2022, the Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer's annual report was transferred to the Audit Committee for review and discussion, which took place in December 2022. We had the benefit of Sir Iain Lobban and Paul Khoo, our Board independent advisers, join this discussion to provide independent and specialist perspective. In conjunction with the Board Risk Committee, we continue to ensure that FC Risk is sufficiently covered in Board committee discussions.\n\nThe Committee continues to receive regular updates from management and EY on the steps being taken by the Group to improve Information Technology (IT) access controls and remediate weaknesses identified in prior year statutory audits. The Committee has kept a close watch on the work under way to improve controls and protect the Group's security systems.\n\nThe Committee has exercised its authority delegated by the Board for ensuring the integrity of the Group's published financial information by discussing and challenging the judgements and disclosures made by management, and the assumptions and estimates on which they are based. The Committee has exercised judgement in deciding which of the issues it considered to be significant in the financial statements, including Climate, and this report sets out the material matters that it has considered in these deliberations.\n\nAs a result of the Committee's work in 2022, assurance has been provided to the Board on the quality and appropriateness of the Group's financial reporting, and on internal audit, compliance and regulatory matters, to continue to safeguard the interests of the Group's broader stakeholders. The following pages provide insight and context into the Committee's work and activities during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Phil Rivett\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

Cognisant of this evolving external landscape, the Committee has paid attention to key macroeconomic issues, geopolitical and emerging risks, as well as key evolving regulatory themes. The current and future implications for the Group have been discussed and challenged, including the actions being taken and planned by management to mitigate these risks. The Committee has carefully considered the challenges posed by inflation, commodity prices, interest rates, FX and the lingering effects of COVID-19, including lockdowns in China and Hong Kong. The impacts of this on sovereign risk and credit risk, in particular, China CRE, have been reviewed and challenged regularly, to ensure that all associated risks are being adequately managed. We have also continued to seek assurances that sufficient resources are in place to manage these complex risks.\n\nThere have been a number of changes to the composition of the Committee in 2022. Naguib Kheraj stepped down as Chair on 30 April, upon which Phil Rivett was appointed Interim Chair. Following receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, I became Chair on 1 August. Shirish Apte and Robin Lawther joined the Committee on 4 May and 1 July respectively. I would like to convey the Committee's gratitude to Naguib for his immense contribution and leadership as both a member and Chair. Mark Smith, our GCRO, retired from the Group at the end of the year, and I would like to express our thanks to Mark for his dedication and valuable contributions to the Committee's deliberations and to the Group more broadly, over the last seven years. Mark's replacement, Sadia Ricke joined the Group on 1 February, (currently awaiting regulatory approval), after successfully completing a rigorous selection process. She brings a broad range of financial and risk experience, as well as a good understanding of our footprint markets. I also want to thank our regulators, for their constructive approach, advice and sharing of best practice, which assists to make the Group more resilient.\n\nResolvability has been a key area of focus. At the beginning of the year, we held a dedicated meeting to focus on the Group's Resolution self-assessment report, ahead of approval by the Board and submission to the PRA and Bank of England (BoE). Furthermore, regular discussions on Resolvability have taken place throughout the year. The Committee and Board remained focused on Resolvability and enhancements have been made to our Resolution capabilities, in terms of addressing shortcomings and developing our areas of enhancement. We have also paid close attention as to how the expectations of the UK regulators are being met. Board and Committee engagements have taken place via formal discussions and training sessions, including a simulation exercise, which was useful to understand the various implications for the Group and a number of its key subsidiaries. Resolvability will remain a key agenda item throughout 2023.\n\nICS Risk management is presented to the Committee by management four times a year. While significant progress has been made, we acknowledge that there is still more work to be done to reach our desired sustainable control environment and defensive position. We have had the benefit of Sir Iain Lobban, our Board independent adviser, attend all ICS discussions to provide independent and specialist perspective. The Committee reviewed the Group's ICS Strategy ahead of approval by the Board; and we also reviewed the findings of the CBEST Threat Intelligence-Led exercise. Given the evolution of ICS Risk, this will remain an area of focus for 2023.\n\nWith the retirement of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee on 1 April 2022, we have placed focus on FC Risk to ensure that this continues to receive sufficient oversight and scrutiny. The Committee received reports from CCIB and CPBB on their strategy, top risks and how these are being mitigated and managed with focused discussion on FC risk.\n\nWe have placed increased attention on stress testing and tail risks, for example running scenarios on stagflation, sovereign default and commodity prices as well as our key regulatory stresses, such as during the 2022 BoE Stress Test results. We have reviewed and discussed geopolitical risks, including China and Russia. We are mindful of the need to continue to probe into the dark corners, and as the economy shows signs of recovery, to maintain the Group's credit discipline. As a result, we have had a renewed focus on implementing an appropriate Risk Appetite framework. The following pages provide insight and context into the Committee's work and activities during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maria Ramos\n\nChair of the Board Risk Committee",

In addition, the Committee had deeper discussions on the topics set out below.\n\nPrincipal risks are risks inherent in the Group's strategy and business model. Principal Risk Types are formally defined in the ERMF, which provides a structure for monitoring and controlling these risks through the Board-approved Risk Appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Principal Risk Types are set out on pages 298 and 301 to 319\n\n## Operational and Technology Risk\n\nThe Group defines Operational and Technology Risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, technology events, human error, or from the impact of external events (including legal risks).\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 discussed Technology Risk reduction and the initiatives under way to manage and reduce Technology Risk and obsolescence\n- \u00b7 discussed a status report on Operational and Technology Risk\n- \u00b7 discussed an update on the embedding of Risk and Control Self-Assessment for effective management of key risks\n- \u00b7 discussed the Operational Risk issues in the transition to becoming a digitally focused bank.\n\n## Model Risk\n\nModel Risk is the potential loss that may occur as a consequence of decisions or the risk of mis-estimation that could be principally based on the output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models.\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed and discussed the key risks and issues relating to Model Risk management\n- \u00b7 provided review and challenge on the Group Model Risk Appetite\n- \u00b7 received updates on the Group Model Risk profile, including a breakdown of active models across model families, associated model risk ratings and model validation outcomes\n- \u00b7 received updates on the progress of model risk strategic initiatives\n- \u00b7 reviewed and discussed progress on Group-related regulatory model submissions and any ongoing regulatory dialogue relating to the progress in establishing a robust model risk management framework\n- \u00b7 attended a teach-in session on Model Risk, focusing on the framework and key regulatory capital related model types.\n\nReviewed and challenged the formulation of the Group's Risk Appetite Statement, in order to assure that it is effective in setting appropriate boundaries in respect of each Principal Risk Type.\n\nConsidered and recommended the Group's Risk Appetite to the Board for approval.\n\nAnnual review of Risk Appetite: After review and recommendation by the Committee, the Board approved a revised set of Risk Appetite metrics which provided a sharper focus on the strategic measures of risk and streamlined the number of metrics reported to the Board. Some metrics were moved for oversight to the Group Risk Committee, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of risk is maintained.\n\nMonitored actual exposures relative to Risk Appetite limits using regular Board Risk Information reports. Tracked a broad range of risk metrics that are reported to the Committee periodically.\n\nAttended a Risk Appetite teach-in session ahead of the annual review discussion, which was helpful in providing dedicated time and space to discuss the sufficiency of the Group's Risk Appetite, statements and metrics in detail. This will be an annual pre-brief discussion going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the Group's Risk Appetite are set out on page 297\n\nThe ERMF sets out the principles and standards for risk management across the branches and subsidiaries of the Group. The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed proposed material changes to the ERMF, arising from the 2022 annual review, and recommended these changes to the Board for approval\n- \u00b7 considered the approach and key outcomes of the 2022 annual effectiveness of the ERMF. Affirmation was received from the Interim GCRO (in situ at the time of the review as the new GCRO awaited regulatory approval) that the Group's risk management and internal control framework is materially effective and improvement areas were highlighted for management attention.",

Such reports enabled the Committee to probe that the Group's three lines of defence are aligned in advancing the Group's ICS strategy and key priorities. Relevant management was invited to these discussions to provide on-theground perspective and detail on any challenges faced\n- \u00b7 discussed regular reports on the Group's Transformation and Remediation Portfolio and ICS Risk profile. Reports are received and discussed by the Committee at least four times and a year\n- \u00b7 discussed and monitored the progress of key risk reduction initiatives across key control domains\n- \u00b7 reviewed and discussed ICS Board Risk Appetite metrics and controls testing, which have been pivotal in enabling the Committee to track the progress being made and delve deeper into areas that require continued focus\n- \u00b7 reviewed and discussed an external report on the Group's ICS programme and management's response\n- \u00b7 continued to probe the sufficiency of funding and resource to support the Group's ICS programme\n- \u00b7 reviewed and discussed the findings from the CBEST Threat Intelligence-Led Assessment.\n\nSir Iain Lobban joined Committee meetings for these discussions, together with the Chief Transformation, Technology & Operations Officer; the Group Chief Information Security Officer, the Group Chief Information Security Risk Officer and representation from Group Internal Audit (GIA). Committee members also regularly attend meetings of the Group's Cyber Security Advisory Forum.\n\n## Treasury Risk\n\nTreasury Risk is the potential for insufficient capital, liquidity or funding to support our operations, the risk of reductions in earnings or value from movements in interest rates impacting banking book items and the potential for losses from a shortfall in the Group's pensions plans.\n\nThe Committee receives the Group Treasurer's report, at each scheduled meeting, which covers market developments, capital, liquidity and funding, recovery and resolution planning, regulatory updates and rating agency updates.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered and discussed the Group's capital and liquidity position and the regulatory environment, including the approval of the Group's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) submission to the PRA, in order to satisfy itself that the Group's approach to capital planning is comprehensive, rigorous and consistent with both the current regulatory requirements and the likely anticipated outlook.\n\nThe Committee considered and discussed the Group's Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) for submission to the PRA, which considers the Group's liquidity position, its framework and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due (see section on stress testing for further details).\n\nThe Committee also reviewed, discussed and challenged the Group's stress test results for the BoE's Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee's work on Resolvability is set out on page 173\n\nFurther details on Treasury Risk are set out on pages 306 and 307\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit Risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to meet its agreed obligations to pay the Group.\n\nThe Committee received and discussed updates on Credit Risk. These discussions were further enhanced through deep dives into various country and business/client segments, details of which are set out in examples of deeper discussions on specific topics.\n\n## Traded Risk\n\nTraded Risk is the potential for loss resulting from activities undertaken by the Group in Financial Markets.\n\nThe Committee received and discussed a paper setting out the major Traded Risk developments and changes which had occurred in the Financial Markets business over the last year. Focus was placed on sufficiency of resources and funding to support the enhanced infrastructure; and assurance was received that Financial Market's growth aspirations are being managed safely. A discussion was also held on Treasury Portfolios and changes which had occurred over the last year.",

        "page_content": "During 2022, an external Board and Board Committee effectiveness review was facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation.\n\n## Key observations from the 2022 external effectiveness review\n\nThe feedback on the Committee's functioning and effectiveness was positive and it specifically highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has a broad remit with a potentially long list of issues\n- \u00b7 The risks associated with the change in GCRO and Committee Chair were acknowledged; however, the Committee feels that these have been mitigated by the continuity of Committee members and strong Finance and Risk teams.\n\n## 2023 Action Plan\n\nThe 2023 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation and continues to build on the solid progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Consider how best to reduce the volume of the Committee pack, with more succinct papers and better use of appendices and non-essential reading materials\n- \u00b7 Keep under review how FC Risk features in the rolling agenda, given the retirement of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee in April 2022\n- \u00b7 Strengthen the focus on Risk Appetite work to be more forward-looking and continued focus on Resolvability\n- \u00b7 Consider how individual Committee members might take responsibility for leading on particularly complex issues, including regulatory matters, so as to improve the Committee's deliberations\n- \u00b7 Schedule a Blue Sky Thinking session for the Board Risk Committee and Audit Committee to consider which key risks could derail the Group's strategy.\n\n## Risk information provided to the Committee\n\nThe Committee is authorised to investigate or seek any information relating to an activity within its Terms of Reference, receives regular reports on risk management, and tracks a wide range of risk metrics through a Board Risk Information report. This report provides an overview of the Group's risk profile against the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. The GCRO's report covers the macroeconomic environment, geopolitical outlook, material events and disclosures and ongoing risks. Coverage of Principal Risk Types and regulatory matters are also included in this report. Regular updates on COVID-19 impacts, country risk and geopolitical tensions have been reported on and discussed throughout the year.\n\nThe Committee has the authority to request and receive relevant information consistent with the requirements of BCBS 239 that will allow the Committee to fulfil its governance mandate relating to risks to which the Group is exposed, and alert senior management when risk reports do not meet its requirements.\n\n## Risk management disclosures\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the risk disclosures in the Annual Report and the Half Year Report, and has also reviewed the disclosures regarding the work of the Committee.\n\n## Interaction with the Group Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Committee Chair meets individually with the GCRO regularly in between formal Committee meetings. These meetings allow open discussion of any matters relating to issues arising from the Committee's formal discussions and inform the forward-looking agenda.\n\n## Interaction with management\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the GCRO. Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discussions in such instances. The Committee Chair also meets individually with senior leaders of the Risk function.\n\n## Interaction with regulators\n\nMaria Ramos attended meetings with the PRA and the BoE over the course of the year.\n\n## Interaction between Board committees on risk-related issues\n\nIn the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board Committees where the remit of these other Committees clearly covers risk-related matters. For example, the Audit Committee reviews the Group's internal financial controls and has oversight of regulatory compliance and the Culture and Sustainability Committee has oversight of culture and sustainability-related matters. The interaction assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discussions held, and the close collaboration of the Committee Chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplication is avoided.\n\n## Risk function resourcing\n\nThe Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its function effectively. The Committee reviewed and discussed a paper setting out an overview of the changes to the Risk function in 2022, management's assessment of the adequacy of people resources within the function and the forward-looking view of the Risk function.\n\n## Linkages with subsidiary board risk committees\n\nMaria Ramos hosted an annual video-conference with the chairs of subsidiary board risk committees and INEDs in October 2022. Maria Ramos also attended a board risk committee of Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited as an observer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of the video-conference can be found on page 161",

The Group is well placed to assist clients in transitioning away from carbon-intensive industries. This is particularly pertinent as a number of countries in the Group's footprint do not yet have a net zero pledge. I am pleased to report that this programme is on track, with the milestones outlined in the Group's public net zero roadmap having been met for 2022.\n\nIn my last report I described the latest chapter of the Group's transformation agenda, which includes a focus on becoming truly purpose-led by taking three Stands: Accelerating Zero, Lifting Participation and Resetting Globalisation. During this year, the Committee monitored progress on how the Stands were coming to life across the organisation, including deep dives with business leaders who shared the initiatives currently in place and plans for the future.\n\nThis year, the Committee has overseen the redefining of the Group's culture aspiration to better reflect the desire for high performance and excellence, the need for transparent management of risk and a 'One Bank' mindset. The new cultural definition is framed around ambition, action and accountability.\n\nExemplary leadership within the Group is essential to the Committee's agenda, such as embedding the Group's culture and ensuring we deliver on our Purpose. It's therefore important for the Committee to oversee the work that the Group is doing to engage our leaders at all levels to aspire, inspire and execute. The Committee heard from a Leadership Council member who gave first-hand experience of how investment in our leaders is being implemented in practice and, more importantly, the impact this was having.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for the Board workforce engagement programme and this year kicked off a review of the current framework, to determine if an alternate model could enhance the Board-colleague connection. This will be concluded and implemented in 2023.\n\nFocus on the Group's diversity and inclusion initiatives continued, and the Committee was pleased with progress across all three strands of work: Best Place to Work (colleagues), Best Place to Bank (clients) and Prosperous Communities (supply chain and communities). The Committee asked the team to increase focus on ethnic diversity to ensure our leadership is representative of our client base and footprint.\n\nWe continued our practice of inviting external speakers to challenge our thinking. This year, the Committee hosted a thought-provoking session on how sustainability is viewed in China, delivered by a pre-eminent industry leader. All Board directors were invited to this session.\n\nThis will be my last report from the Committee as I stand down from the Board at the 2023 AGM. It has been a real pleasure to chair this Committee (and its previous incarnation) over eight years, during which time our agenda has developed very meaningfully along with the Group's strategy and the wider environment. I'd like to thank all my colleagues past and present who should feel proud of what they have achieved. Particular thanks to Christine Hodgson, who stood down from the Board and the Committee on 31 January 2023, for her unwavering dedication and significant contribution to the Committee's evolution over the past nine years.\n\nFinally, I'd like to welcome the two new members of the Committee, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt, who have already started to make a positive impact in the Committee's deliberations, and I wish them well as they take the Committee forward.\n\nThe following report provides further insight into the Committee's work during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jasmine Whitbread\n\nChair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee",

As part of the Committee's succession planning for the Board, it takes into account the Group's strategy and challenges, and makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any adjustments to the Board's composition.\n\nThe Committee also: keeps under review the leadership needs of, and succession plans for, the Group in relation to both executive directors and other senior executives; has oversight of the process by which the Board, its committees and individual directors assess their effectiveness; keeps the diversity of the Board under review and monitors progress towards achieving its objectives in this area; considers any potential situational conflicts of interest declared by Board members; considers the impact of material changes to corporate governance regulation and legislation affecting the Group; and has oversight of the Group's approach to subsidiary corporate governance.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nThis year has seen a number of significant changes to the composition of the Board, following the retirement of a number of our longstanding and valued independent non-executive directors. I would like to thank Naguib Kheraj, former Deputy Chairman and Chair of the Board Risk Committee who retired from the Board in April for his dedication and significant and impactful contributions to the Board and Committee discussions. My thanks also go to Byron Grote who retired from the Board in November for his many contributions to the Board and its Committees. I would also like to thank Christine Hodgson, former Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee for her insightful contributions as well as for agreeing to remain on the Board until 31 January 2023 to ensure a smooth transition to a new Remuneration Committee Chair, Shirish Apte. Before recommending the short extension beyond her nine-year term, the Committee conducted a robust assessment of her independence. We also announced that Jasmine Whitbread would not be seeking re-election at the 2023 AGM and would retire from the Board at that time.\n\nThe Committee has been focused on planning for the transition of our long-standing non-executive directors, ensuring that the Board remains well balanced with a strong pipeline of candidates with the appropriate skillsets, experience and capabilities, specifically across banking and financial services; executive and non-executive global listed experience; remuneration committee experience; and broad market and gender diversity. Over the course of 2022, and with the assistance of an external search firm we shortlisted and recommended to the Board the appointment of four experienced independent non-executive directors, Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther, Jackie Hunt and Linda Yueh, each of whom bring elements of these key attributes to the Board discussion. Details on each of the new directors can be found on pages 139, 141 and 142.\n\nAs well as focusing on the search for new directors, we also spent a great deal of time refreshing the committees' succession, notably the Chairs of the Board Risk and Remuneration Committees. This resulted in the appointment of Maria Ramos and Shirish Apte taking on the respective roles. Maria Ramos also took on the Senior Independent Director role from Christine Hodgson upon her reaching her nineyear tenure.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Committee considered the significant progress which had been made by the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee in the area of financial crime risk since it was formed, and in line with the recommendations of the 2020 Board effectiveness review, recommended to the Board that its work was reallocated to a combination of the Board Risk Committee, Audit Committee and the Board, signalling a significant milestone in this area for the Group.\n\nDetail of the Committee's annual review of the Board Diversity Policy and its assessment of progress against it can be found on pages 180 to 182. Following the significant realignment of the Policy a couple of years ago, only one material change was recommended in 2022, to increase the representation of women on the Board to at least 40 per cent, reflecting the Board's continued commitment to further balancing female representation on the Board and to align to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) changes to the Listing Rules in this area.\n\nAs part of the Committee's governance oversight role, we continued to receive updates from the three regional CEOs who each have responsibility for the subsidiary governance processes across their regions and provide a holistic view of the governance framework and challenges faced across the Group's footprint. This was further reinforced with the return of the Global Subsidiary Conference in Dubai in November, attended by members of the Board and Management Team and the Chairs and selected INEDs from across the Group's diverse footprint. This conference provided an important opportunity for creating and maintaining appropriate linkages with the Group's subsidiaries, as well as sharing best practice.\n\nThe Committee also paid significant attention to enhancing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. An externally facilitated Board effectiveness review was commissioned in the autumn which concluded that the Board continues to operate effectively while also signalling several areas for improvement, details of which can be found on page 156.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als\n\nChair of the Governance and Nomination Committee",

In considering the Board's succession, the Committee takes into account the length of tenure of the INEDs, and the importance of regularly refreshing the Board membership.\n- \u00b7 Systematically reviewed a number of INED long and short lists throughout the year to identify potential candidates with a diverse range of skills, experience, knowledge and perspectives. This process resulted in the Committee recommending to the Board the appointments of Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther, Jackie Hunt and Linda Yueh.\n- \u00b7 Maintained oversight of the progress made by Shirish Apte, against his tailored Board and committee induction programmes.\n- \u00b7 Provided oversight of the detailed executive and senior management (level below Management Team) succession plans, alongside other critical roles, including the oversight of a process of external market mapping of key management roles.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed succession plans for the committee chair roles, identifying appropriate individuals with the necessary skills and attributes to provide emergency cover as required, as well as on a longer term basis, including acknowledging and addressing where gaps exist. Following this process, the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of:\n- -  Maria Ramos as Senior Independent Director, Chair of the Board Risk Committee and a member of the Governance and Nomination Committee\n- -  Shirish Apte as a member and subsequently Chair of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Governance and Nomination Committee\n- -  David Conner as a member of the Remuneration Committee\n- -  Robin Lawther as a member of the Remuneration Committee and Culture and Sustainability Committee\n- -  Jackie Hunt as a member of the Culture and Sustainability Committee and Audit Committee.",

We strive to maintain a diverse Board, recognising the benefits of having a Board made up of individuals with a diverse mix of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, knowledge, personal attributes, skills and experience. We also aim to reflect the Group's aspirations in relation to its employees and its values and to position the Group as a global leader in these areas. This diversity provides a range of perspectives which we believe contribute to the effective Board dynamics.\n\nWe made good progress in improving the balance of female directors on the Board this year, with female representation on the Board at 43 per cent, above the new target being incorporated into the UK Listing Rules in 2023, of 40 per cent. However, this will continue to move around in the short term as the composition of the Board continues to change.\n\nWhile acknowledging the importance of gender diversity around the board table and ultimately gender parity on the Board, we also recognise the importance of balancing gender diversity within the broader context of diversity, which is particularly relevant given the diverse markets in which the Group operates.",

        "page_content": "## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThis year's Committee Effectiveness Review was conducted simultaneously with that of the Board and comprised an externally facilitated evaluation conducted by Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation. Broadly, members and other contributors felt that the Committee is well chaired, methodical and diligent in its work. There has been significant focus on delivering more Board appointments during the year, although there was a sense that the process could be speeded up over the coming year as well as ensuring an orderly succession of key Board roles over the next few years. A summary of the key observations and the subsequent actions can be found below.\n\n## Key observations from the 2022 external effectiveness review\n\nThe feedback on the Committee's functioning and effectiveness was positive and it specifically highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7 Members continued to feel that the Committee was well Chaired and the Board was kept well informed of its activities\n- \u00b7 There was a sense from existing and new INEDs that the recruitment process could be streamlined and more pace and efficiency injected into the process\n- \u00b7 Members supported greater flexibility in the tenure of INEDs on the Board, to create greater option in succession planning\n- \u00b7 Confidence in the quality of the new joiners is high, but it is inevitable that some of the Board is in induction mode at present\n- \u00b7 The succession plans for the years ahead should be discussed more widely.\n\n## Progress against the 2022 Action Plan:\n\nThe 2022 Action Plan set out a number of actions from the internally facilitated Committee evaluation conducted in 2021. The 2022 Action Plan was reviewed during the year and good progress had been made against the actions.\n\n## 2023 Action Plan\n\nThe 2023 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the Board evaluation and continues to build on the solid progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Increase the pace of the INED appointment process\n- \u00b7 Focus on increasing the level of technology experience on the Board\n- \u00b7 Improve diversity by increasing representation from across our markets\n- \u00b7 Continue to enhance the comprehensive induction programmes for new Board and Committee members, by including additional written information and scheduling a follow-up induction at the end of the first year\n- \u00b7 Continue to oversee the development of the executive talent pipeline with a view to increasing the proportion on senior internal appointments.",

Key responsibilities of the Committee include:\n\n- \u00b7 Oversight of our Fair Pay Charter including the development and implementation of remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with sound and effective risk management to support the Group's strategic priorities and enable long-term sustainable success.\n- \u00b7 Approval of Group discretionary remuneration, including adjustment for risk, control and conduct matters.\n- \u00b7 Determining and agreeing the remuneration framework and policies for the Group Chairman, executive directors and other senior executives, using the Fair Pay Charter principles, taking into account wider workforce remuneration, and ensuring the alignment of reward with culture and conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written terms of reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Summary of 2022 remuneration decisions\n\n- \u00b7 The current economic environment remains challenging, with rising inflation across large parts of our network. In order to support our staff, especially junior colleagues, we are implementing salary increases in April 2023, at a global average of 6.6 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Salary increases for executive directors and senior management, at 3.4 per cent, are 50 per cent lower than the average increase for other UK employees.\n- \u00b7 Group performance in 2022 was strong, across financial and non-financial metrics, as measured through the Group balanced scorecard. As such, the approved aggregate discretionary remuneration for the year is USD1,589 million, up 16 per cent on 2021.\n- \u00b7 Annual incentive awards for executive directors, Bill Winters (CEO) and Andy Halford (CFO), were assessed at 70 per cent of the maximum for Bill and at 69 per cent of the maximum for Andy.\n- \u00b7 Reward for all Group employees, including executive directors, continues to be aligned to the Group's strategic priorities, through the annual and long-term incentive scorecards.\n\nI am pleased to present our directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2022. I joined the Committee on 1 August 2022 and assumed responsibility as Committee Chair on 1 January 2023, after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals. I have the honour of taking over as Chair of the Remuneration Committee from Christine Hodgson, who has been the Committee Chair from May 2015 until December 2022. I would like to thank Christine for the significant contribution she has made to the Committee as Chair and for working with me through a very comprehensive handover process.\n\nThe Group has performed well in 2022, despite continuing challenges in the external environment, such as the ongoing impact of the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising inflation. This report provides an overview of the Committee's work during 2022 with respect to remuneration for executive directors and the wider workforce. The decisions we have taken were based upon careful consideration of a broad range of factors such as rising inflation in several of our markets, economic difficulties faced by our colleagues, and the need for appropriate and fair reward for our workforce. The directors' remuneration policy has been operated as intended, to incentivise performance linked to the Group's strategy and to be aligned with shareholder interests.\n\n## Response to 2022 AGM remuneration votes\n\n## 2022 directors' remuneration policy\n\nThe Committee engaged with shareholders during 2021 and early 2022 and feedback from this consultation was used as an input into the development of the 2022 directors' remuneration policy. At the AGM, the directors' remuneration policy received the support of 69 per cent of shareholders. In view of the number of opposing votes, the Committee continued to engage with shareholders to understand their concerns.",

While we recognise that this provision is not standard practice in the UK, we have confirmed to shareholders that its application, if used, will not be automatic. Each case will be considered on its own merit by the Committee taking into account the Group's financial and non-financial performance and any other relevant circumstances. The directors' remuneration report at that time will contain full disclosure on the Committee's decision and rationale, and shareholders will then have the opportunity, through the AGM vote, to express their view on whether the specific disapplication was appropriately applied or not.\n\nThe shareholders we met with confirmed that they would consider the circumstances and explanation very carefully if the provision is ever used and vote accordingly.\n\n## 2021 directors' remuneration report\n\nThe resolution to approve the directors' remuneration report for 2021 received the support of 73 per cent of shareholders. The main concern related to our response to the fine on the Group in December 2021 by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for liquidity reporting and governance failings.\n\nA detailed review of the issues connected with the fine had been undertaken at the end of 2019, when the matter was first identified and a further review was carried out in 2021 when the fine was imposed. Remuneration actions were taken at a collective and individual level. We acknowledge that we should have provided more information on the significant steps taken by the Committee since 2019 to address this matter. We will take this feedback into account in our disclosures going forward.\n\nHaving reflected on the views expressed by shareholders during the engagement process, we remain satisfied that the remuneration adjustments made were appropriate. The Committee continues to be updated on risk matters at all its meetings.\n\n## Our performance in 2022\n\nThe Group delivered a strong set of results for the year. Underlying profit before tax is up 15 per cent on 2021, reflecting our resilient and improving financial performance. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) is up 120 basis points to 8 per cent, and on track to meet our increased ambition of 11 per cent by 2024. The Group remains well capitalised with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at 14 per cent, the top of our stated range of 13-14 per cent.\n\nThe formulaic outcome for Group performance, based on the balanced scorecard, was 71 per cent. Of this, 39 per cent (out of a possible 50 per cent) related to financial performance, including strong underlying income growth, income from new business and the increase in RoTE. The remaining 32 per cent related to achieving non-financial goals, including significant improvement in client satisfaction, strong performance against our engagement, diversity and inclusion targets and progress on our Stands (more information on our Stands can be found on page 24).\n\n## Group-wide remuneration\n\n## 2022 discretionary annual incentives\n\nOur strong performance in 2022, in the face of ongoing external challenges, is reflected in increased remuneration outcomes for the year.\n\nThe Group scorecard assessment of 71 per cent is a starting point for determining discretionary remuneration. In arriving at a distributable pool, the Committee considers additional factors such as share price performance, the impact of rising interest rates and overall affordability. The Committee also considers carefully all risk, control and conduct matters, including ongoing investigations and any matters raised by regulators. As ever, the Committee's assessment also takes into account our Fair Pay principles.\n\nFollowing its review of these factors, the Committee determined that a reduction of 4 percentage points from the initial scorecard outcome was appropriate. This resulted in a final Group scorecard outcome of 67 per cent for the purposes of discretionary remuneration and an aggregate incentive pool of USD1,589 million, 16 per cent higher than 2021 on a reported basis and 28 per cent higher on a same store basis. Further details can be found on page 187.\n\n## 2023 salaries\n\nDuring 2022, we have seen high inflation in many of our markets due to global economic challenges. In response to this, we made targeted changes to salaries in 2022 to support colleagues in markets faced with the most extreme economic conditions.\n\nAs a result of ongoing cost of living pressures in many of our markets, average global salary increases of 6.6 per cent are being awarded in 2023. Increases have been weighted towards our junior colleagues and colleagues in countries where cost of living pressures are most significant. Executive director and senior management salary increases will be discounted by 50 per cent from the rate applicable in their respective market.\n\n## Executive director remuneration in 2022\n\n## Annual incentives for executive directors\n\nIn 2021, the Committee approved a change to the executive directors' scorecard by including an individual performance assessment measure of 10 per cent. Financial measures continue to make up 50 per cent of the total scorecard, while strategic and non-financial measures make up the balance of 40 per cent. These changes were covered in the 2021 report.\n\nFor the year 2022, the Committee approved scorecard outcomes, including individual performance assessments, of 70 per cent of the maximum for Bill, and 69 per cent of the maximum for Andy. Applying these scores to the annual incentive maximum, the Committee approved annual incentives of GBP1,499,344 for Bill, a 26 per cent increase over 2021, and GBP944,803 for Andy, a 24 per cent increase over 2021. The Committee is satisfied that these are appropriate given the strong performance of the Group in 2022 and the significant personal contributions from Bill and Andy. Further detail can be found on pages 194 to 196.",

        "page_content": "## 2020-22 LTIP awards vesting in March 2023\n\nThe 2020-22 LTIP awards are due to vest in March 2023 with the expected vesting currently at 22 per cent, based on performance against strategic measures. The final total shareholder return (TSR) performance will be assessed in March 2023. The projected values delivered by the 22 per cent outcome and included in the single total figures of remuneration for Bill and Andy are GBP1,024,408 and GBP634,488 respectively and are based on a share price of GBP5.78 (three-month average to 31 December 2022) compared with the share price on award of GBP5.20, an increase of 11 per cent.\n\nThe Committee considered the question of windfall gains from awards granted in 2020. The share price when the awards were granted was 15 per cent lower than the grant price in the prior year. The Committee decided not to make any adjustment at grant for the lower share price at the start of the pandemic. Instead the Committee opted to review any potential windfall gains at the end of the performance period. Having considered the position now, the Committee is comfortable that the share price increase over the performance period has been broadly consistent with improvement in underlying financial performance.\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration for 2022\n\nThe 2022 annual incentive and expected 2020-22 LTIP vesting results in a 2022 single figure for Bill of GBP5,483,442 and for Andy of GBP3,412,390. This represents a year-on-year increase of 16 and 13 per cent, respectively, reflecting the strong Group performance in 2022.\n\n## 2022 single total figure of remuneration (\u00a3000)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA significant portion of both Bill's and Andy's total remuneration is delivered in shares which will be released over the next eight years. The deferral, retention and recovery provisions of their pay continue to reinforce alignment of their incentives with shareholder interests and the Group's longterm performance. Both Bill and Andy continue to exceed their shareholding requirements (see page 199 for further details).\n\n## Executive directors' remuneration in 2023\n\nIn accordance with the approved remuneration policy, the Committee considers annual salary increases for executive directors taking account of any increase in scope or responsibility, market competitiveness, and salary increases across the Group.\n\nIn line with our approach for all senior management, the Committee has awarded salary increases of 3.4 per cent to Bill and Andy, 50 per cent lower than the average increase awarded to the other UK employees. This increases their salaries in 2023 from GBP2,434,000 to GBP2,517,000 and from GBP1,556,000 to GBP1,609,000 respectively, effective from 1 April.\n\nIn September 2022, the UK Government announced measures to remove the cap on banker incentives imposed in 2014. On 19 December 2022, the PRA issued a consultative paper on this subject. Should the cap be removed as is expected we will consult extensively with shareholders before making changes to our remuneration policy.\n\n## 2023-25 LTIP awards to be granted in March 2023\n\nHaving considered 2022 performance, the Committee has approved LTIP awards for the period 2023-25 of GBP3,212,880 and GBP2,053,920 to Bill and Andy respectively, representing 132 per cent of their salary. As in the past, these are performance linked awards, and vesting will depend upon achieving specified performance targets by the end of the three year review period (2025). Following the review period, the shares will vest pro-rata from years three to seven. There is an additional retention period of 12 months after vesting. Performance will be assessed based on RoTE with a CET1 underpin, TSR relative to a defined peer group, and the achievement of sustainability and other measures, including our Stands, that are aligned with the Group's strategic priorities.\n\nDiscussions with shareholders were held in January 2023 on the development of these performance measures and targets and the input received was incorporated into the final decisions by the Committee. Further details on the 2023-25 LTIP awards and the performance measures and targets can be found on pages 199 and 200.\n\nIn the rest of this report we present the disclosures required by regulations, as well as additional information to explain how remuneration for our executives aligns with our strategy, shareholder interests and wider workforce pay. In making remuneration decisions for 2022 and beyond, we have also been mindful of the experience of our wider stakeholder group.\n\nI would like to thank Christine for her very significant contributions as Chair of the Committee. I would also like to thank my fellow Committee members for the work they have put into the Committee, and our shareholders for their ongoing support and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shirish Apte\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n(All disclosures in the directors' remuneration report are unaudited unless otherwise stated.

The full policy, including recruitment and leaver provisions, can be found on pages 161 to 166 of the 2021 Annual Report and on our website.\n\nOur approach to remuneration is consistent for all employees and is designed to create alignment with our Fair Pay Charter principles, which apply globally.

For example:\n\n- \u00b7 All remuneration decisions are grounded in our Fair Pay Charter, with one consistent set of principles for the wider workforce and executive directors (further details on our Fair Charter are on page 193).\n- \u00b7 Employee performance is assessed based on what is achieved and how it is achieved in line with our valued behaviours. Our remuneration structure and policies ensure that behaviours consistent with these values are appropriately recognised and rewarded.\n- \u00b7 To support this approach, the wider workforce and our executive directors participate in continuous performance management and feedback.\n- \u00b7 Our LTIP assessment measures include a conduct gateway to further support this.\n\n## Alignment with our strategy\n\nRemuneration decisions made across the Group, including for our executive directors, align with our strategic priorities and our Stands, including our commitment to sustainable social and economic development through:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance measures in our Group and LTIP scorecards are designed to drive achievement of the financial and strategic goals that will deliver long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and our Stands are key considerations for setting and measuring financial and strategic targets.\n\n## Alignment with our approach to risk and control\n\nThe determination of remuneration policy and outcomes align with the Group's risk and control framework (see page 211 for further details). In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group and LTIP scorecards include risk and control measures.\n- \u00b7 In addition, the Committee considers further discretionary risk adjustment in respect of the Group scorecard outcome and has a track record of applying discretion appropriately.\n- \u00b7 The rules of the LTIP also give the Committee necessary discretion to further adjust vesting outcomes if the Committee considers that the outcome is inconsistent with underlying business performance.\n- \u00b7 Long-term sustainable performance is supported through the ability to make adjustments to variable remuneration for risk, control and conduct behaviours, the deferral of variable remuneration, and the ability to apply malus and clawback where appropriate.\n- \u00b7 The incentives for employees engaged in Audit, Risk and Compliance functions are set independent of the businesses they oversee.\n\n## How does our directors' remuneration policy address other key features set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code?\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- \u00b7 In line with our commitment to pay for performance, a significant proportion of executive director pay is delivered through incentives based on performance metrics aligned with our strategy.\n- \u00b7 Executive directors' interests are further aligned with long-term shareholder interests through the deferred release of salary, annual incentive and LTIP awards over a period ranging from one to eight years. Incentive awards are also subject to clawback provisions for up to 10 years from grant.\n- \u00b7 Additional shareholding requirements are in place for executive directors requiring them to build and maintain a significant shareholding in Company shares while in employment and, for a period of two years post-employment. Both executive directors currently exceed their respective shareholding requirements.\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u00b7 The range of possible rewards to individual executive directors is set out in the scenario charts on page 203 where we also demonstrate the impact of a 50 per cent share price appreciation over the three-year performance period of the LTIP.\n- \u00b7 Maximum awards levels for all incentives are capped at 220 per cent of salary and cannot exceed regulatory limits. Other than vesting levels which are driven by performance outcomes, the only source of variation in final payouts is that a significant part of incentive awards is delivered in shares and is linked to the share price.\n\n## Simplicity and clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Simplicity is a key driver for the structure of our executive pay, subject to regulatory requirements arising from operating as a UK regulated bank.\n- \u00b7 Additional information is included on the alignment of executive and wider workforce pay on pages 188 and 189 in the summary of the directors' remuneration policy in support of our commitment to clarity.",

This includes determining the framework and policies for the remuneration of the Group Chairman, the executive directors and other senior management. The Committee also oversees the alignment of reward, culture, the strategic priorities and our Stands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written terms of reference that can\n\nbe viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nThe table below shows the votes cast 1 at the AGM in May 2022 on remuneration related matters.\n\n|                                                 | For                | Against            | Withheld   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Advisory vote on the                            | 408,108,378        | 149,094,072        | 55,027,858 |\n| 2021 remuneration  report                       | 73.24%             | 26.76%             | 55,027,858 |\n| Binding vote to   approve the   2022 directors' | 404,531,068 68.81% | 183,344,607 31.19% | 24,340,637 |\n\nThe Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with shareholders on the development of the directors' remuneration policy in 2021 and early 2022. Subsequently, following the voting outcome at the AGM, the Committee re-engaged with shareholders as explained on pages 184 and 185 and in our update statement in September 2022.\n\n## Key observations from the 2022 external effectiveness review\n\nThe key points highlighted by the review include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee is recognised for dealing with difficult and sensitive issues, and the work the Committee Chair does in consulting with investors and attending subsidiary RemCo meetings is appreciated.\n- \u00b7 The close coordination of remuneration and sustainability issues, strengthened by cross-membership of the Remuneration Committee and Culture and Sustainability Committee provides helpful alignment.\n- \u00b7 Positive commentary was given on the support received from internal specialists (e.g. human resources, finance, risk) and PwC (the external advisers).\n- \u00b7 Non-Committee members feel well informed of the key issues and areas of discussion.\n\n## Advice to the Committee\n\nThe Committee was assisted in its considerations by PwC, who were formally re-appointed as the Committee's remuneration adviser in 2021. It is the Committee's practice to undertake a detailed review of potential advisers every three or four years.\n\nPwC is a signatory to the voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC also provides professional services to the Group in the ordinary course of business, including assurance, advisory, tax advice and certain services relating to Human Resources. The Committee considered PwC's role as an adviser to the Group and determined that there was no conflict or potential conflict arising. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and independent. The total fee paid to PwC (on an agreed fee basis) was \u00a3104,208, which includes advice to the Committee relating to executive directors' remuneration and regulatory matters.\n\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer and Group Chief Risk Officer provided the Committee with regular updates on finance and risk matters. The Committee recognises and manages any conflicts of interest when receiving views from executive directors or senior management on remuneration proposals and no individual is involved in deciding their own remuneration.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe feedback from the externally conducted 2022 Committee effectiveness review was positive. The key points raised and the action plan for 2023 are summarised below.\n\n## 2023 Action Plan\n\nThe 2023 Action Plan for the Committee reflects the recommendations from the effectiveness review and continues to build on the progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Consider how PwC can best provide further insight on how the Group's more sensitive remuneration proposals will be received by investors.\n- \u00b7 Consider how non-Committee members can become more informed on the Committee's debate, while protecting confidentiality.",

The Committee considered the changes to traditional ways of working and discussed approaches to attracting and retaining future talent to drive a high-performance culture.\n\n## Understanding the views of our workforce\n\nThe Committee recognises the importance of seeking feedback from colleagues on remuneration to inform decisionmaking. This year, 87 per cent of colleagues responded to the Group's engagement survey, which sought to understand colleague sentiment in respect of performance management, the process of giving and receiving feedback and reward. Key insights were presented to the Committee for discussion, and results were shared with the workforce along with a summary of actions being taken.\n\nThe Board engages with and listens to the views of employees. In 2022, the Board hosted informal events with employees which provided an opportunity for the Board to understand how the Bank's strategy and culture are being lived and embedded across the Group.\n\nFurther information on our workforce engagement framework is included in our Culture and Sustainability Committee report on pages 176 to 178.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group-wide remuneration\n\n## Our Fair Pay Charter\n\nThe Fair Pay Charter is the compass for our performance and reward strategy and outlines how we aim to ensure fairness in our approach to reward. It sets out the principles that underpin our performance and reward strategy and associated decisions - including providing a sufficient level of financial security, being competitive against the market, paying for performance, ensuring consistency and transparency in outcomes, supporting flexibility and wellbeing of colleagues, and rewarding colleagues in a way that is free from unjust bias.\n\nTogether with broader human resources initiatives supporting diversity and inclusion, organisational and individual development and the recognition of high performance, we are building a culture of excellence where, through innovation and continuous improvement, each and every one of our colleagues can fulfil their potential.\n\nFull details of the Charter can be found in our Fair Pay Report here: sc.com/fairpayreport\n\nKey highlights include:\n\n## Financial security during the cost of living crisis\n\nDuring 2022, supporting colleagues' financial security in the face of widespread cost of living challenges has been a priority. We have taken a number of actions to support this, including intervening in markets faced by the most extreme economic circumstances, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Zimbabwe, to address the challenges facing our more junior employees in particular. We have also set aside additional funding for 2023 salary increases, again prioritising junior colleagues.\n\n## Redefining our approach to manage and reward performance\n\nIn 2022, we launched a new approach to motivate outperformance and deliver a culture of excellence by redefining how we manage, recognise and reward performance across the Group. With this approach we are creating a more transparent, real-time feedback culture underpinned by continuous feedback, coaching, and open two-way performance and development conversations with people leaders.\n\nWe also introduced our Leadership Agreement, designed to set clear expectations of the leadership standards needed to drive and accelerate our performance, focused around behaviours that aspire, inspire and drive execution.\n\n## Diversity and pay\n\nSince 2017, we have published gender pay gap analysis for the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE and the US. In 2022, for the first time, we have extended our diversity pay analysis to include ethnicity pay gap reporting in the UK and US. These analytics, which are included in our Fair Pay Report, combined with local insights on the unique dynamics and talent context of each market, enable us to better understand the strengths and gaps in the organisation, and to develop action plans to tap into the potential of a truly diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\n## Fair Pay Charter principles\n\n|   1 | We commit to pay a living wage in all our markets  and seek to go beyond compliance with minimum  wage requirements.                                                                                                                          |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | We provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable  pay and a core level of benefits to ensure a minimum  level of earnings and security to colleagues and to  reflect the Group's commitment to wellbeing.                                  |\n|   3 | We support colleagues in working flexibly, in ways  that balance both business needs and their personal  circumstances, and provide colleagues with the  opportunity to select the combination and level of  benefits that is right for them. |\n|   4 | Pay is well administered with colleagues paid  accurately, on time and in a way that is convenient  for them.                                                                                                                                 |\n|   5 | We provide a competitive total fixed and variable  pay opportunity that enables us to attract, motivate  and retain colleagues based on market rates for their  role, location, performance, skills and experience.                           |\n|   6 | The structure of pay and benefits is consistent for  colleagues based on their location and role, with a  clear rationale for exceptions.                                                                                                     |\n|   7 | We are committed to rewarding colleagues in a way  that is free from discrimination on the basis of  diversity, as set out in our Group Code of Conduct.                                                                                      |\n|   8 | We ensure pay decisions reflect the performance   of the individual, the business they work in and   the Group, and recognise the potential, conduct,  behaviours and values demonstrated by each  individual.                                |\n|   9 | We set clear expectations for how colleagues are  rewarded and the principles guiding decisions,  including clear personal objectives and feedback.                                                                                           |\n|  10 | We provide clear communication of pay and  performance decisions, and seek feedback and input  from colleagues on our pay structures and outcomes.                                                                                            |",

It also sets out the 2022 fees paid to the Group Chairman and the INEDs.\n\n## Annual incentive awards for the executive directors (audited)\n\nAnnual incentive awards for executive directors are based on the assessment of the Group scorecard and personal performance, embedded into the scorecard assessment for the executive directors in 2022, in line with the remuneration policy.\n\nThe personal element accounts for a maximum weighting of 10 per cent, with financial measures continuing to make up to 50 per cent and the strategic measures accounting for up to 40 per cent. The Committee has also considered progress demonstrated against our Stands in the determination of the overall scorecard outcome. The Group scorecard is used for all eligible employees, including the executive directors, to maintain alignment and a shared sense of purpose.\n\nFor Bill and Andy, the Committee considered Group performance, individual performance, and risk, control and conduct-related matters (with input from Risk and other control functions).

In addition, the Committee has the discretion to take into account at the end of the performance period any changes in regulatory capital and risk-weighted asset requirements that might have been announced and implemented after the start of the performance period.\n- 5   Initiative that targets growth of efficient and regulatory friendly deposits to improve quality of our funding mix (liabilities) to support the Group's growth aspirations. The definition of high quality liabilities within the 2022 scorecard excludes term deposits, therefore the achievement of USD(17.8)billion excludes the migration to Term Deposits from CASA balances driven by the high interest rate environment.",

These LTIP awards were granted in 2020 with a face value of 120 per cent of fixed pay, to incentivise the achievement of the Group's refreshed strategic priorities over the three-year period 2020 to 2022. The awards are share-based and were subject to the satisfaction of stretching RoTE, TSR and strategic performance measures over three years. The targets for these measures were set at the beginning of 2020 and have not been adjusted to reflect the challenges caused by the onset of the pandemic. A conduct gateway requirement must be met before any awards vest.\n\nThe Committee concluded that Bill and Andy exhibited appropriate conduct during the performance period and therefore the conduct gateway was met.\n\nThe threshold RoTE target has not been achieved and the relative TSR threshold target will be measured in March 2023 but is estimated not to have been achieved. The Committee considered performance against the strategic proof points set out in the table below and determined that vesting of 22 per cent was appropriate.\n\nThe share price used to estimate the value of vesting of the 2020-22 LTIP awards is higher than the share price on the award date of GBP5.196 and the value attributable to share price growth for Bill and Andy can be seen in the single total figure of remuneration on the next page.\n\nThe Committee considered carefully the vesting of the LTIP awards, taking account of the share price at grant, which was 15 per cent lower than the share price of the awards made in the previous year. The stretching targets set at the beginning of 2020 were not adjusted to reflect the impact of the pandemic, and the share price increase to the end of the performance period has been broadly consistent with the improvement in underlying performance. Therefore, the Committee considers the values to be delivered remain appropriate, and are not a windfall.\n\nThe awards will vest pro rata over 2023 to 2027 and the shares will be subject to a 12 month retention period post-vesting.

Shares purchased voluntarily from their own funds are equivalent to 79 and 58 per cent of salary for Bill and Andy, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarises the executive directors' shareholdings and share interests:\n\n|              | Shares held  beneficially 1,2,3   | Unvested share  awards not  subject to  performance  measures   (net of tax) 4,5   | Total shares  counting  towards  shareholding  requirement   | Shareholding  requirement as  a percentage  of salary   | Salary     | counting  towards  shareholding  requirement as  a percentage  of salary 1 Unvested share  awards subject  to performance  measures 637%   |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bill Winters | 2,315,677                         | 175,196                                                                            | 2,490,873                                                    | 250%                                                    | \u00a32,434,000 | 2,315,512                                                                                                                                  |\n| Andy Halford | 989,936                           | 111,527                                                                            | 1,101,463                                                    | 200%                                                    | \u00a31,556,000 | 441% 1,465,157                                                                                                                             |\n\n## LTIP awards for the executive directors to be granted in 2023\n\nThe size of the LTIP award has been determined based on Group and individual performance during the year. Awards for the 2022 performance year will be granted to Bill and Andy in March 2023 with a value of 132 per cent of salary (GBP3.2 million and GBP2.1 million, respectively), the maximum amount under the 2022 directors' remuneration policy. The amount that the executive directors will receive at the end of the three-year performance period will be based on the level of performance achieved against the performance measures and the future share price.\n\nThe performance measures and targets are aligned with our strategic priorities, and continue to incorporate measures that reflect our three Stands. The sustainability measures have been selected based on their level of impact for the Group and wider society and ability to drive financial returns in the medium term. Details of the sustainability and other strategic measures and targets are shown in the table below and are disclosed prospectively, except where the internal targets are considered commercially sensitive. Details of achievement against targets will be disclosed retrospectively at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe RoTE target range for the awards is increased to 10 to 12.5 per cent, from 7 to 11 per cent for the 2022-24 awards. A narrower range of 2.5 ppts is considered appropriate due to the increase in target range which reflects the progress in RoTE achieved in 2022 and our increased ambition of 11 per cent by 2024.\n\nThe peer group of companies selected for the calculation of the relative TSR performance are companies with generally comparable business activities, size or geographic spread to Standard Chartered or companies with which we compete for investor funds and talent. The peer group is intended to be representative of our geographic presence and business operations. The TSR peer group for the 2023-25 LTIP awards will be the same as for the 2022-24 LTIP and is detailed below. TSR is measured in sterling for each company and the TSR data is averaged over a month at the start and end of the three-year measurement period which starts from the date of grant.\n\nRemuneration regulations for UK banks prohibit the award of dividend equivalent shares on vesting. The number of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP will take into account the lack of dividend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield) such that the overall market value of the award is maintained.\n\nThese awards will vest in five annual tranches beginning after the third anniversary of the grant (i.e. March 2026 to March 2030) subject to meeting the performance measures set out below at the end of 2025. All vested shares are subject to a 12 month retention period.\n\nThe performance measures for the 2023-25 LTIP awards are set out in the table on page 200.\n\n| Banco Santander   | Credit Suisse   | KB Financial Group                  |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Bank of America   | DBS Group       | Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation |\n| Bank of China     | Deutsche Bank   | Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale                    |\n| Bank of East Asia | HSBC            | Standard Bank                       |\n| Barclays          | ICBC            | State Bank of India                 |\n| BNP Paribas       | ICICI           | UBS                                 |\n| Citigroup         | JPMorgan Chase  | United Overseas Bank                |",

Executive directors are permitted to hold non-executive directorship positions in other organisations. Where such appointments are agreed with the Board, the executive directors may retain any fees payable for their services. Both executive directors served as non-executive directors elsewhere and received fees for the period covered by this report as set out below.

A portion of the executive directors' salaries is paid in shares to strengthen shareholder alignment. Bill's pension is delivered as a contribution to a defined contribution plan and as a cash allowance. Andy's pension is delivered as a cash allowance. The pension allowance is set as a percentage of salary (both the cash and shares components).\n\nThe Committee reviews the salaries of the executive directors on an annual basis, after considering any changes to the scope or responsibility of the role, alignment with marketcompetitive levels, and consideration of the average salary increases made across the Group.\n\nIn response to the global cost of living challenges, salary increases across the Group have been focused towards junior employees and are generally higher than in 2022. Taking into account the average 2023 salary increase awarded to the Group's UK and global workforce, the Committee has determined that an increase is appropriate and has awarded salary increases of 3.4 per cent to Bill and Andy. In line with the approach used for all senior roles, these increases are 50 per cent lower than the average increase awarded to other UK employees. This increases their salaries from GBP2,434,000 to GBP2,517,000 and from GBP1,556,000 to GBP1,609,000 respectively. Details of fixed pay for Bill and Andy with effect from 1 April 2023 are set out below.\n\n|                                              | Bill Winters   | Bill Winters   | Bill Winters   |       |       |          |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|-------|----------|\n| \u00a3000                                         | 2023           | 2022           | % change       | 2023  | 2022  | % change |\n| Salary                                       | 2,517          | 2,434          | 3.4            | 1,609 | 1,556 | 3.4      |\n| of which cash                                | 1,258          | 1,217          | 3.4            | 1,078 | 1,043 | 3.4      |\n| of which shares                              | 1,259          | 1,217          | 3.4            | 531   | 513   | 3.4      |\n| Pension                                      | 252            | 243            | 3.4            | 161   | 156   | 3.4      |\n| Total fixed pay                              | 2,769          | 2,677          | 3.4            | 1,770 | 1,712 | 3.4      |\n| Proportion of total fixed pay paid in cash   | 55%            | 55%            | 0              | 70%   | 70%   | 0        |\n| Proportion of total fixed pay paid in shares | 45%            | 45%            | 0              | 30%   | 30%   | 0        |\n\n## Illustration of application of the 2023 remuneration policy\n\nThe charts below illustrate the potential outcomes under our directors' remuneration policy (i.e. for awards that would be made in March 2023, based on 2022 performance and fixed remuneration with effect from 1 April 2023).\n\nThe charts show potential remuneration outcomes for each executive director in four performance scenarios: minimum, on-target, maximum and maximum with 50 per cent share price appreciation, in line with reporting requirements.

The targets are set annually by the Committee and take into account the Group's annual financial plan and strategic priorities for the next few years which reflect the evolving macroeconomic outlook. The Committee will also consider progress demonstrated against our Stands in the determination of the overall scorecard outcome.\n\nFrom 2022, to simplify the process, the Committee embedded the assessment of personal performance into the annual incentive scorecard assessment, accounting for a maximum weighting of 10 per cent. Financial measures continue to make up 50 per cent of the annual incentive scorecard. Strategic and personal measures are assessed by the Committee using a quantitative and qualitative framework.\n\nThe Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them before the end of the financial year. As such, targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2023 Annual Report alongside the level of performance achieved.\n\n## Step 1: Conduct gateway requirement to be met in order to be eligible for any annual incentive\n\nAppropriate level of individual valued behaviours and conduct exhibited during the course of the year\n\n## Step 2: Measurement of performance against financial and other strategic and personal measures\n\n| Financial measures                                                                             | Weighting   | Target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Income 1                                                                                       | 10%         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Costs                                                                                          | 10%         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| RoTE 2  with a CET1 3  underpin   of the higher of 13% or the  minimum regulatory  requirement | 30%         | \u00b7  Targets to be disclosed retrospectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Other strategic measures                                                                       | Weighting   | Target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Clients (network, affluent, mass,  ventures)                                                   | 12%         | \u00b7  Improve client satisfaction and client experience ratings. \u00b7  Deliver growth in qualified clients across Affluent, Private Banking, and Wealth  Management activity. \u00b7  Deliver network income growth in Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking.            |\n| Sustainability                                                                                 | 8%          | \u00b7  Progress against the Group's sustainable finance revenue targets and its aim to  achieve net zero by 2050. \u00b7  Improve community engagement through employee volunteering participation.                                                                            |\n| Enablers (ways of working and  people)                                                         | 8%          | \u00b7  Grow proportion of digitally initiated transactions and digital sales adoption. \u00b7  Improve end-to-end speed to deliver change (from idea formation to  commercialisation). \u00b7  Improve organisational effectiveness.                                                |\n| Risk and controls                                                                              | 12%         | \u00b7  Non-financial risk reduction. \u00b7  Self-identification of audit issues.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Personal performance measures                                                                  | Weighting   | Target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Bill -

The Chairman's fee has remained unchanged since his appointment in 2016. In recent years, the demands made of our Chairman and INEDs has increased in line with greater regulatory expectations, and an increase in the amount of learning and training required.\n\nConsidering this alongside the high inflationary pressures being faced in a number of our markets the Board determined an increase in fee levels was appropriate. The revised fees are set out in the table below. The Chairman and the INEDs are eligible for benefits in line with the directors' remuneration policy.

Further details on the alignment of executive director and wider workforce remuneration is set out on pages 188 and 189.\n\n| Measure                | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| External  market  data | \u00b7  We compete for talent in a global marketplace, with many of our key competitors based outside the UK.

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The pay ratios are calculated using Option A published methodology, in line with investor guidance.\n- \u00b7 Employee pay data is based on full-time equivalent pay for UK employees as of 31 December for the relevant year and excludes leavers, joiners and employee transfers in or out of the UK during the year to help ensure data is on a like-for-like basis. Total pay is calculated in line with the single figure methodology (i.e. fixed remuneration accrued during the financial year and variable remuneration relating to the performance year) and data for insured benefits are based on notional premiums. No other calculation adjustments or assumptions have been made.\n- \u00b7 CEO pay is as per the single total figure of remuneration for 2022 and restated for 2021 to take account of the actual LTIP vesting in 2022. Further information on the single total figure is on page 198. The 2022 ratio will be restated in the 2023 directors' remuneration report to take account of the final LTIP vesting data for eligible employees and for the CEO.\n- \u00b7 The Committee has considered the data for the three individuals identified at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile for 2022 and believes that it is a fair reflection of pay among the UK employee population. Each individual identified was a full-time employee during the year and received remuneration in line with the Group remuneration policy, and none received exceptional pay.\n- \u00b7 Our LTIP is intended to link total remuneration to the achievement of the Group's long-term strategy and to reinforce alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interest. Participation is typically senior employees who have line of sight to influence directly the performance targets on the awards. The lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees identified this year are not participants in the LTIP.\n\n## Group performance versus the CEO's remuneration\n\nThe graph below shows the Group's TSR performance on a cumulative basis over the past 10 years alongside that of the FTSE 100 and peer banks.

In 2022, Naguib Kheraj and Byron Grote stepped down from the Board on 30 April and 30 November respectively. Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt were appointed to the Board on 4 May, 1 July and 1 October respectively.\n- 3.  The increase in fees for Maria Ramos is due to changes in Board and Committee responsibilities during the year.\n- 4.  Employee data is based on full-time equivalent pay for UK employees as of 31 December of the relevant year. This data excludes leavers, joiners and employee transfers in or out of the UK during the year to help ensure data is on a like-for-like basis. Salary percentage change reflects increases decided at the end of 2021 and implemented in 2022.\n\nFor the CEO, CFO, the Group Chairman and INEDs, the data the changes relate to are set out on pages 198 and 201, respectively. The change in taxable benefits relates to the change in the values for the 2021/20, 2020/21 and 2019/20 tax years.\n\nDue to the low value of the taxable benefits received by INEDs, which have not exceeded \u00a31,000 in 2022 (set out on page 201), small changes to these values are expected to cause the percentage change to fluctuate year-on-year.\n\n## Scheme interests awarded, exercised and lapsed during the year\n\nEmployees, including executive directors, are not permitted to engage in any personal investment strategies with regards to their Company shares, including hedging against the share price of Company shares.

For the 2022-24 LTIP awards granted to Bill Winters and Andy Halford on 14 March 2022, the values granted were: Bill Winters: \u00a33.1 million; Andy Halford \u00a32.0 million. The number of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP took into account the lack of dividend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield) such that the overall value of the award was maintained. Performance measures apply to 2022-24 LTIP awards. The closing price on the day before grant was \u00a34.876.\n- 2.  Dividend equivalent shares may be awarded on vesting for awards granted prior to 1 January 2018. On 31 March 2020, Standard Chartered announced that in response to the request from the PRA and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges facing the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board decided to withdraw the recommendation to pay a final dividend for 2019. Dividend equivalent shares allocated to the 2016-18 LTIP and 2017-19 awards vesting in 2022 did not include any shares relating to the cancelled dividend.\n- 3.  Shares (before tax) were delivered to Bill Winters and Andy Halford from the vesting element of LTIP awards. The number of shares and the closing share price on the day before the shares were delivered were as follows:\n- 2016-18 LTIP: 6 May 2022, 36,023 shares delivered to Bill Winters and 21,510 shares delivered to Andy Halford. Previous day closing share price: \u00a35.65.\n\n2017-19 LTIP: 14 March 2022, 48,428 shares delivered to Bill Winters and 29,982 shares delivered to Andy Halford. Previous day closing share price: \u00a34.876.\n\n2018-20 LTIP: 10 March 2022, 28,178 shares delivered to Bill Winters and 17448 shares delivered to Andy Halford. Previous day closing share price: \u00a34.931.\n\n- 2019-21 LTIP: 21 March 2022, 30,604 shares delivered to Bill Winters and 19,571 shares delivered to Andy Halford. Previous day closing share price: \u00a35.064.\n- 4. Andy Halford chose to participant in the 2022 Sharesave. This unvested option was granted on 28 November 2022 under the 2013 Plan - to exercise this option, Andy has to pay an exercise price of \u00a34.23 per share, which has been discounted by 20 per cent. On 29 December 2022, Andy Halford exercised his 2019 Sharesave option under the 2013 Plan at an exercise price of \u00a34.98 per share. The closing share price on the day before exercise was \u00a36.292.\n- 5.  The unvested LTIP awards held by Bill Winters and Andy Halford are conditional rights. They do not have to pay towards these awards. Under these awards, shares are delivered on vesting or as soon as practicable thereafter.\n- 6.  The vesting date relates to the end of the savings contract and the start of the six month exercise window.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, none of the directors had registered an interest or short position in the shares, underlying shares or debentures of the Company or any of its associated corporations that was required to be recorded pursuant to section 352 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance, or as otherwise notified to the Company and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited pursuant to the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Issuers.\n\n## Historical LTIP awards\n\nThe current position on projected vesting for unvested LTIP awards from the 2020 and 2021 performance years based on current performance and share price as of 31 December 2022 is set out in the tables below.

The table below shows the distribution of earnings between stakeholders over the past five years. The amount of corporate tax, including the bank levy, is included in the table because it is a significant payment and illustrates the Group's contribution through the tax system.\n\n|                                     | Actual   | Actual   | Actual   | Actual   | Actual   | Allocation   | Allocation   | Allocation   | Allocation   | Allocation   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                     | 2022  $m | 2021  $m | 2020  $m | 2019  $m | 2018  $m | 2022  %      | 2021  %      | 2020  %      | 2019  %      | 2018  %      |\n| Staff costs                         | 7, 61 8  | 7, 6 6 8 | 6,886    | 7,1 2 2  | 7, 074   | 80           | 84           | 85           | 74           | 75           |\n| Corporate taxation   including levy | 1,486    | 1,138    | 1,193    | 1,720    | 1,763    | 16           | 12           | 15           | 18           | 19           |\n| Paid to shareholders   in dividends | 393      | 375      | 0        | 720      | 561      | 4            | 4            | 0            | 8            | 6            |\n\n## Approach to risk adjustment\n\nRemuneration is aligned with our long-term interests and the time frame over which financial risks crystallise.

MRTs are identified on both a: (i) Standard Chartered PLC (Group) basis; and (ii) solo level consolidated entities under Standard Chartered Bank UK (Solo) basis.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nThe qualitative criteria broadly identifies the following colleagues as Group MRTs:\n\n- \u00b7 directors (both executive and non-executive) of Standard Chartered PLC\n- \u00b7 a member of senior management\n- \u00b7 senior colleagues within the audit, compliance, legal and risk functions\n- \u00b7 senior colleagues within Material Business Units (MBUs)\n- \u00b7 colleagues who are members of specific committees\n- \u00b7 colleagues who are able to initiate or approve credit risk exposures above a certain threshold and sign off on trading book transactions at or above a specific value at risk limit\n- \u00b7 colleagues whose professional activities may have a significant impact on the risk profile of a MBU and are above certain pay thresholds\n- \u00b7 traders and senior colleagues in Financial Markets who earn above certain pay thresholds.\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nThe quantitative criteria identifies colleagues:\n\n- \u00b7 who have been awarded total remuneration of GBP660,000 or more in the previous financial year\n- \u00b7 whose total remuneration in the preceding year is within the top 0.3 per cent of the Group or Solo entity.\n\nFor the purpose of the Pillar 3 tables on pages 213 to 215, supervisory function is defined as non-executive directors of Standard Chartered PLC, management function is defined as executive directors of Standard Chartered PLC and other senior management is defined as  senior managers under the Senior Manager and Certification Regime and members of the Group Management Team.\n\nSolo MRTs are identified based on similar criteria applied to the Solo entity.\n\n## MRT remuneration delivery\n\nRemuneration for MRTs was delivered in 2022 through a combination of salary, pension, benefits and variable remuneration.\n\nVariable remuneration for MRTs is structured in line with the PRA and FCA's remuneration rules. For the 2022 performance year, the following structure applies:\n\n- \u00b7 At least 40 per cent of an MRT's variable remuneration will be deferred over a minimum period of four years and a maximum of seven years depending on the applicable identification criteria.\n- \u00b7 60 per cent of an MRT's variable remuneration will be deferred if variable remuneration exceeds GBP500,000.\n- \u00b7 Non-deferred variable remuneration will be delivered 50 per cent in shares, subject to a minimum 12 month retention period, and 50 per cent in cash.\n- \u00b7 At least 50 per cent of deferred variable remuneration will be delivered entirely in shares, subject to a minimum 12 month retention period (with the exception of deferred shares awarded to higher paid MRTs, which are subject to a six month minimum retention period in line with the regulations).\n- \u00b7 For some MRTs, part of their 2022 variable remuneration may be in LTIP share awards which are released after a minimum of four years, subject to the satisfaction of performance measures and holding periods.\n- \u00b7 As explained on page 211, all variable remuneration is subject to remuneration adjustment provisions. This provides the Group with the ability to reduce or revoke variable remuneration in respect of a risk, control or conduct issue, event or behaviour.\n- \u00b7 Material risk takers are subject to a 2:1 maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration.",

The directors have taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit information and ensure that the Group statutory auditors are aware of such information.\n\n## Viability and going concern\n\nHaving made appropriate enquiries, the Board is satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from 16 February 2023 and therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe directors' viability statement in respect to the Group can be found in the Strategic report on pages 132 and 133, while the directors' going concern considerations of the Group can be found on page 350.\n\n## Sufficiency of public float\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Company has maintained the prescribed public float under the rules governing the listing of securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the 'Hong Kong Listing Rules'), based on the information publicly available to the Company and within the knowledge of the directors.\n\n## Research and development\n\nDuring the year, the Group invested $1.98 billion (2021: $1.89 billion) in research and development, of which $0.94 billion (2021: $0.94 billion) was recognised as an expense. The research and development investment primarily related to the planning, analysis, design, development, testing, integration, deployment and initial support of technology systems.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Group has a policy in place which prohibits donations being made that would: (i) improperly influence legislation or regulation, (ii) promote political views or ideologies, and (iii) fund political causes. In alignment to this, no political donations were made in the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## Directors and their interests\n\nThe membership of the Board, together with their biographical details, are given on pages 138 to 142. Details of the directors' beneficial and non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 184 to 217. The Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its directors and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of these arrangements are included in the Directors' remuneration report and in Note 31 to the financial statements\n\nThe Company has received from each of the INEDs an annual confirmation of independence pursuant to Rule 3.13 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules and still considers all of the nonexecutive directors to be independent.\n\nAt no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contracts of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, we have established a process requiring directors to disclose proposed outside business interests before any are entered into. This enables prior assessment of any conflict or potential conflict of interest and any impact on time commitment. On behalf of the Board, the Governance and Nomination Committee reviews existing conflicts of interest annually to consider if they continue to be conflicts of interest, and also to revisit the terms upon which they were determined to be. The Board is satisfied that our processes in this respect continue to operate effectively.\n\nSubject to company law, the Articles of Association and the authority granted to directors in general meeting, the directors may exercise all the powers of the Company and may delegate authorities to committees. The Articles of Association contain provisions relating to the appointment, re-election and removal of directors. Newly appointed directors retire at the AGM following appointment and are eligible for election. All directors are nominated for annual re-election by shareholders subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon their annual assessment.\n\nNon-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of one year and subject to (re)election by shareholders at AGMs, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.\n\nThe Company has granted indemnities to all of its directors on terms consistent with the applicable statutory provisions. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the purposes of section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2022 and remain in force at the date of this report.\n\n## Qualifying pension scheme indemnities\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2022 for the benefit of the UK's pension fund corporate trustee (Standard Chartered Trustees (UK) Limited), and remain in force at the date of this report.\n\n## Significant agreements\n\nThe Company is not party to any significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of the Company. The Company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company's share schemes and plans may cause options and awards granted to employees under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.",

This was due to the cancellation of ordinary shares as part of the Company's two share buy-back programmes. No ordinary shares were issued during the year. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no rights to fixed income. On a show of hands, each member present has the right to one vote at our general meetings. On a poll, each member is entitled to one vote for every $2 nominal value of share capital held.\n\nThe issued nominal value of the ordinary shares represents 86.8 per cent of the total issued nominal value of all share capital. The remaining 13.2 per cent comprises preference shares, which have preferential rights to income and capital but which, in general, do not confer a right to attend and vote at our general meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the Group's share capital can be found in Note 28 to the financial statements\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. There are no specific restrictions on voting rights and the directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company's shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company's share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the Company's Articles of Association can be found on our website here sc.com/investors\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the AGM held on 4 May 2022, our shareholders renewed the Company's authority to make market purchases of up to 302,578,862 ordinary shares, equivalent to approximately 10 per cent of issued ordinary shares as at 21 March 2022, and up to all of the issued preference share capital.\n\nThe authority to make market purchases up to 10 per cent of issued ordinary share capital was used during the year through two buy-back programmes announced in February and July 2022. These were utilised to reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue and as part of the Group's approach to dividend growth and capital returns. The first share buy-back programme was launched on 21 February 2022 and ended on 19 May 2022. The second share buy-back programme was launched on 1 August 2022 and ended on\n\n10 October 2022. A total of 184,369,245 ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.50 were re-purchased for an approximate aggregate consideration paid of $1,250 million.\n\nA monthly breakdown of the shares purchased during the period including the lowest and highest price paid per share is set out in Note 28 to the financial statements. All ordinary shares which were bought back were cancelled.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of a waiver granted by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKSE) as subsequently modified, the Company will comply with the applicable law and regulation in the UK in relation to holding of any shares in treasury and with the conditions of granting the waiver by the HKSE. No treasury shares were held during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in Note 28 to the financial statements\n\n## Authority to issue shares\n\nThe Company is granted authority to issue shares by the shareholders at its AGM. The size of the authorities granted depends on the purposes for which shares are to be issued and is within applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Shareholder rights\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, shareholders holding 5 per cent or more of the paid-up share capital of the Company carrying the right of voting at general meetings of the Company are able to require the directors to hold a general meeting. A request may be in hard copy or electronic form and must be authenticated by the shareholders making it. Where such a request has been duly lodged with the Company, the directors are obliged to call a general meeting within 21 days of becoming subject to the request and must set a date for the meeting not more than 28 days from the date of the issue of the notice convening the meeting.\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, shareholders holding 5 per cent or more of the total voting rights at an AGM of the Company, or 100 shareholders entitled to vote at the AGM with an average of at least \u00a3100 paid-up share capital per shareholder, are entitled to require the Company to circulate a resolution intended to be moved at the Company's next AGM.

The information provided in the table below was correct at the date of notification; however, the date received may not have been within 2022. It should be noted that these holdings are likely to have changed since the Company was notified.\n\nHowever, notification of any change is not required until the next notifiable threshold is crossed.\n\nAhead of joining the Group in May 2022, Shirish Apte stepped down as an independent non-executive director of Pierfront Capital Mezzanine Fund, a 90 per cent owned subsidiary of Temasek.\n\n| Notifiable interests               | Interest in  ordinary shares  (based on voting  rights disclosed)   |   Percentage of  capital disclosed | Nature of holding as per disclosure         |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited | 474,751,383                                                         |                              16    | Indirect                                    |\n| BlackRock Inc.                     | 183,640,172                                                         |                               5.55 | Indirect (5.01%) Securities Lending (0.39%) |\n| Dodge & Cox                        | 150,620,884                                                         |                               5.08 | Indirect                                    |\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nDetails of transactions with directors and officers and other related parties are set out in Note 36 to the financial statements.\n\n## Connected/continuing connected transactions\n\nBy virtue of its shareholding of over 10 per cent in the Company, Temasek and its associates are related parties and connected persons of the Company for the purposes of the UK Listing Rules and the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ('HKEx') ('the HK Listing Rules') respectively (together 'the Rules').\n\nThe Rules are intended to ensure that there is no favourable treatment to Temasek or its associates to the detriment of other shareholders in the Company. Unless transactions between the Group and Temasek or its associates are specifically exempt under the Rules or are subject to a specific waiver, they may require a combination of announcements, reporting and independent shareholders' approval.\n\nOn 12 November 2021, the HKEx extended a waiver (the 'Waiver'), it previously granted to the Company for the revenue banking transactions with Temasek which do not fall under the passive investor exemption ('the Passive Investor Exemption') under Rules 14A.99 and 14A.100 of the HK Listing Rules. Under the Waiver, the HKEx agreed to waive the announcement requirement, the requirement to enter into a written agreement and set annual caps, and the annual report disclosure (including annual review) requirements under Chapter 14A of the HK Listing Rules for the three-year period ending 31 December 2024 on the conditions that:\n\n- a) The Company will disclose details of the Waiver (including nature of the revenue banking transactions with Temasek and reasons for the Waiver) in subsequent annual reports; and\n- b) The Company will continue to monitor the revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe main reasons for seeking the Waiver were:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature and terms of revenue banking transactions may vary and evolve over time; having fixed-term written agreements would not be suitable to accommodate the various banking needs of the Company's customers (including Temasek) and would be impractical and unduly burdensome.\n- \u00b7 It would be impracticable to estimate and determine an annual cap on the revenue banking transactions with Temasek as the volume and aggregate value of each transaction are uncertain and unknown to the Company as a banking group due to multiple factors including market driven factors.\n- \u00b7 The revenues generated from revenue banking transactions were insignificant. Without a waiver from the HKEx or an applicable exemption, these transactions would be subject to various percentage ratio tests which cater for different types of connected transactions and as such may produce anomalous results.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group provided Temasek with money market and foreign exchange revenue transactions that were revenue transactions in nature.\n\nAs a result of the Passive Investor Exemption and the Waiver, the vast majority of the Company's transactions with Temasek and its associates fall outside of the connected transactions regime. However, non-revenue transactions with Temasek or any of its associates continue to be subject to monitoring for connected transaction issues.\n\nThe Company confirms that:\n\n- \u00b7 The revenue banking transactions entered into with Temasek in 2022 were below the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio test under the HK Listing Rules; and\n- \u00b7 It will continue to monitor revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe Company therefore satisfied the conditions of the Waiver.",

        "page_content": "## Non-revenue transaction with Temasek\n\nThe following non-revenue transaction between Temasek and the Group was entered into and during the year ended 31 December 2022 and relevant announcement had been made by the Company on 3 November 2022 in accordance with the HK Listing Rules:\n\nOn 3 November 2022, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Chartered Overseas Holdings Limited ('SCOHL'), entered into a share subscription agreement with Partior Pte. Ltd. ('Partior') ('Share Subscription Agreement'), pursuant to which SCOHL agreed to subscribe for 31,923 ordinary shares and 9,036,404 Series A preference shares in Partior (collectively the 'Subscription Shares') at a price of US$2.573 per Subscription Share, and for a total subscription price of US$23,332,806 in order to acquire 25% shareholding in Partior, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\nOn completion of the Share Subscription Agreement, SCOHL will enter into a shareholders' agreement ('Shareholders' Agreement') with Partior, Silverheels Investments Pte. Ltd. ('Silverheels'), DBS Finnovation Pte. Ltd. and JPMC Strategic Investments I Corporation (with the latter two collectively the 'Other Transaction Parties'). The Shareholders' Agreement contains terms and shareholder rights customary for transactions of this nature, including as to board representation, voting, transfer restrictions and exit provisions. Regarding the Other Transaction Parties, to the best of the Company's knowledge, information and belief having made all reasonable enquiry, save for DBS Finnovation Pte. Ltd. in which Temasek is an indirect substantial shareholder, JPMC Strategic Investments I Corporation and its ultimate beneficial owner are both independent third parties of the Company and connected persons of the Company. Immediately before the signing of the Share Subscription Agreement, Partior's shares were held by Silverheels and the Other Transaction Parties in equal proportion.\n\nThe equity investment in Partior builds on the Company's desire to shape the Future of Payments by assuring the Company could provide a payment foundation that is able to meet its clients' emerging needs. It allows the Company to deepen its blockchain innovation capabilities and ramp up its commitment to building a more transparent, efficient and secure infrastructure for global value movement.\n\nAs Temasek is a substantial shareholder of the Company as defined under the HK Listing Rules, Temasek is a connected person of the Company. By virtue of Temasek holding more than 30% of its issued share capital, via Silverheels, Temasek's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Partior is also a connected person of the Company. Pursuant to Chapter 14A of the HK Listing Rules, SCOHL's entry into the Share Subscription Agreement between SCOHL and Partior and the Shareholders' Agreement between SCOHL, Partior, Silverheels and the Other Transaction Parties constitutes a connected transaction for the Company.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, Standard Chartered Overseas Holdings Limited had changed its name to Standard Chartered Strategic Investments Limited.\n\n## Fixed assets\n\nDetails of additions to fixed assets are presented in Note 18 to the financial statements.\n\n## Loan capital\n\nDetails of the loan capital of the Company and its subsidiaries are set out in Notes 22 and 27 to the financial statements.\n\n## Debenture issues and equity-linked agreements\n\nDuring the financial year ended 31 December 2022, the Company made no issuance of debentures or equity-linked agreements.\n\n## Risk management 1\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management system. An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks that we face is in place. The Board is satisfied that this process constitutes a robust assessment of all of the principal risks, topical and emerging risks and Integrated risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsidiaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entities of the Group.\n\nKey areas of risk on financial instruments for the directors included the impairment of loans and advances and valuation of financial instruments held at fair value. This risk assessment and management is explained further in the Audit Committee Key areas and Action taken on pages 164 and 165.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Risk review and Capital review on pages 236 and 325 sets out the principal risks, topical and emerging risks and integrated risks, our approach to risk management, including our risk management principles, an overview of our Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the risk management and governance practices for each principal risk type. The Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement can be found on pages 301 to 309\n\nIn accordance with Article 435(1)(e) of the UK onshored Capital Requirements Regulation, and the Disclosure (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, the Board Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has considered the adequacy of the risk management arrangements of the Group and has sought and received assurance that the risk management systems in place are adequate with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.\n\n## Internal control 1\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control system. Its effectiveness is reviewed regularly by the Board, its committees, the Management Team and Group Internal Audit.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the Board Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. As part of this review, affirmation was received from the Interim GCRO (in situ at the time of the review as the new GCRO awaited regulatory approval) that the Group's risk management and internal control framework is materially effective and improvement areas were highlighted for management attention. Group Internal Audit represents the third line of defence and provides independent assurance of the effectiveness of management's control of business activities (the first line) and of the control processes maintained by the Risk Framework Owners and Policy Owners (the second line). The audit programme includes obtaining an understanding of the processes and systems under audit review, evaluating the design of controls, and testing the operating effectiveness and outcomes of key controls. The work of Group Internal Audit is focused on the areas of greatest risk as determined by a risk-based assessment methodology. The Board considers the internal control systems of the Company to be effective and adequate.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsidiaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entities of the Group.",

The findings of all adverse audits are reported to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive where immediate corrective action is required.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee is responsible for exercising oversight, on behalf of the Board, of the key risks of the Group. It reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and Enterprise Risk Management Framework and makes recommendations to the Board. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight and advice to the Board on matters relating to financial reporting. The Committee's role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the Group's internal controls including internal financial controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk management approach starting on page 295 describes the Group's risk management oversight committee structure.\n\nOur business is conducted within a developed control framework, underpinned by policy statements and standards. There are written policies and standards designed to ensure the identification and management of risk, including Credit Risk, Traded Risk, Treasury Risk, Operational and Technology Risk, Information and Cyber Security Risk, Compliance Risk, Financial Crime Risk, Model Risk, Climate Risk and Reputational and Sustainability Risk. The Board has established a management structure that clearly defines roles, responsibilities and reporting lines.\n\nDelegated authorities are documented and communicated. Executive risk committees regularly review the Group's risk profile. The performance of the Group's businesses is reported regularly to senior management and the Board. Performance trends and forecasts, as well as actual performance against budgets and prior periods, are monitored closely. Financial information is prepared using appropriate accounting policies, which are applied consistently.\n\nOperational procedures and controls have been established to facilitate complete, accurate and timely processing of transactions and the safeguarding of assets. These controls include appropriate segregation of duties, the regular reconciliation of accounts and the valuation of assets and positions. In respect of handling inside information, we have applied relevant controls on employees who may handle inside information, including controls over the dissemination of such information and their dealings in the Company's shares. Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Employee policies and engagement\n\nWe work hard to ensure that our employees are kept informed about matters affecting or of interest to them, and more importantly have the opportunities to provide feedback and engage in a dialogue.\n\nWe continue to listen and act on feedback from colleagues to ensure internal communications are timely, informative, meaningful, and in support of the Group's strategy and transformation. In addition to the Bridge (our primary internal communications platform) which allows colleagues to receive key updates, exchange ideas and provide feedback, we also leverage a range of channels including email, digital newsletters with customised content for each employee segment, audio and video calls, virtual and face-to-face townhalls, and other staff engagement and recognition events. To continue to improve the way we communicate and ensure our employee communications remain relevant, we also periodically analyse and measure the impact of our communications through a range of survey and feedback tools. We are currently assessing our suite of communication channels as we prepare to launch improved solutions and discontinue those that are less effective.\n\nOur senior leaders and people leaders continue to play a critical role in engaging our teams across the network, ensuring that they are kept up to date on key business developments related to our performance and strategy. We provide additional support to our people leaders with specific calls and communications packs to help them provide context and guidance to their team members to better understand their role in executing and delivering the Group's strategy.\n\nAcross the organisation, regular team meetings with people leaders, one-to-ones and various management meetings provide an important platform for colleagues to discuss and clarify key issues. Regular performance conversations provide the opportunity to discuss how individuals, the team and the business area have contributed to our overall performance and how any compensation awards relate to this. The Group's senior leadership also regularly share global, business, function, region and market updates on performance, strategy, structural changes, HR programmes, community involvement and other campaigns.\n\nThe Board engages with and listens to the views of the workforce through several sources, including through interactive engagement sessions. More information can be found on pages 162 and 177 in the Directors' report.\n\nEmployees, past, present and future can follow our progress through the Group's LinkedIn network and Facebook page, as well as other social network channels including Instagram, which collectively have over 2.4 million followers.\n\nThe diverse range of internal and external communication tools and channels we have put in place ensure that all our colleagues receive timely and relevant information to support their effectiveness.\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is central to our thinking about benefits and support, so that they can thrive at work and in their personal lives. Our Group minimum standards provide employees with a range of flexible working options, in relation to both location and working patterns. In terms of leave, employees are provided with at least thirty days' leave (through annual leave and public holidays), a minimum of twenty calendar weeks' fully paid maternity leave, a minimum of two calendar weeks of leave for spouses or partners, and two calendar weeks for adoption leave. Combined, this is above the International Labour Organisation minimum standards.",

        "page_content": "We seek to build productive and enduring partnerships with various employee representative bodies (including unions and work councils). In our recognition and interactions, we are heavily influenced by the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and several International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions including the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98) and the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87). 14 per cent of employees across 19 markets have collective representation through unions or employee representative bodies. The working conditions and terms of employment of other employees are based on our Group and country policies, and in accordance with individual employment contracts issued by the Group.\n\nThe Group Grievance Standard provides a formal framework for dealing with concerns that employees have in relation to their employment or another colleague, which affects them directly, and cannot be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as counselling, coaching or mediation. This can include concerns related to bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation, as well as concerns regarding conditions of employment (for example, health and safety, new working practices or the working environment). Employees can raise grievances to their People Leader or a Human Resources (HR) Representative. The global process for addressing grievances involves an HR representative and a member of the business reviewing the grievance, conducting fact finding into the grievance and providing a written outcome to the aggrieved employee. If a grievance is upheld, the next steps might include remedying a policy or process, or initiating a disciplinary review of the conduct of the colleague who is the subject of the grievance. The Group Grievance Standard and accompanying process is reviewed on a periodic basis in consultation with stakeholders across HR, Legal, Compliance and Shared Investigative Services. Grievance trends are reviewed on a quarterly basis and action is taken to address any concerning trends.\n\nThere is a distinct Group Speaking Up Policy which covers instances where an employee wishes to 'blow the whistle' on actual, planned or potential wrongdoing by another employee or the Group.\n\nThe Group is committed to creating a fair, consistent, and transparent approach to making decisions in a disciplinary context. This commitment is codified in our Fair Accountability Principles, which underpin our Group Disciplinary Standard. Dismissals due to misconduct issues and/or performance (where required by law to follow a disciplinary process) are governed by the Group Disciplinary Standard. Where local law or regulation requires a different process with regards to dismissals and other disciplinary outcomes, we have country variances in place.\n\nOur Group Diversity and Inclusion Standard has been developed to ensure a respectful workplace, with fair and equal treatment, diversity and inclusion, and the provision of opportunities for employees to participate fully and reach their full potential in an appropriate working environment. The Group aims to provide equality of opportunity for all, protect the dignity of employees and promote respect at work. All individuals are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, and to be free from harassment, bullying, discrimination and victimisation. This helps to support productive working conditions, decreased staff attrition, positive employee morale and engagement, maintains employee wellbeing, and reduces people-related risk. All employees and contractors are required to take personal responsibility to comply with the Standard, including conducting themselves in a manner that demonstrates appropriate, non-discriminatory behaviours.\n\nThe Group is committed to provide equal opportunities and fair treatment in employment. We do not accept unlawful discrimination in our recruitment or employment practices on any grounds including but not limited to: sex, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, national or indigenous origin, disability, age, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, sexual orientation, gender identity, expression or reassignment, HIV or AIDS status, parental status, military and veterans status, flexibility of working arrangements, religion or belief. We strive for recruitment, appraisals, pay and conditions, training, development, succession planning, promotion, grievance/disciplinary procedures and employment termination practices that are inclusive and accessible; and that do not directly or indirectly discriminate. Recruitment, employment, training, development and promotion decisions are based on the skills, knowledge and behaviour required to perform the role to the Group's standards. Implied in all employment terms is the commitment to equal pay for equal work. We will also make reasonable workplace adjustments (including during the hiring process) to ensure all individuals feel supported and are able to participate fully and reach their potential. If employees become disabled, we will proactively seek to support them with appropriate training and workplace adjustments where possible and explore every opportunity to ensure their employment continues.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nOur Health, Safety and Wellbeing (HSW) programme covers both mental and physical health and wellbeing. The Group complies with both external regulatory requirements and internal policy and standards for HSW in all markets. It is Group policy to ensure that the more stringent of the two requirements is always met, ensuring our HSW practices meet or exceed the regulatory minimum. Compliance rates are reported at least biannually to each country's Management Team.",

        "page_content": "We follow the ILO code of practice on recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, as well as aligning to UK Health and Safety Executive, and ensuring we meet all local H&S regulatory reporting requirements. We record and report all work-related illness and injuries, including sub-contractors, visitors and clients.\n\nHSW performance and risks are reported annually to the Group Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. We use a health and safety management system across all countries to ensure a consistently high level of health and safety reporting for all our colleagues and clients.\n\nThe Bank sponsors medical and healthcare services for all employees, except in markets where cover is provided through State-mandated healthcare, which represent less than 0.5 per cent of the Group's employees. All staff also have access to professional counselling via our Employee Assistance Program, as well as to more proactive mental health support through our holistic wellbeing app and wellbeing platform.\n\nFurthermore, we consider and treat mental health in the same way that we would treat physical health. Our global Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) programme offers help to someone developing a mental health problem, experiencing a worsening of an existing mental illness or a mental health crisis. The mental health support is given until appropriate professional help is received, or the crisis resolved. To date we have trained over 500 mental health first aiders in 48 markets, covering more than 99 per cent of colleagues.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded one work-related fatality where a contractor was fatally injured when crossing a road in Pakistan. Major injuries (per the UK Health & Safety Executive definition) decreased from 24 in 2021 to 21, with fractures the most common type of major injury (21%).\n\nOverall, reported injuries increased by 5.1% per cent, with 'slips/trips/falls' and 'transport/commuting' remaining the most common causes of injury. Our injury rates remain aligned to, or better than industry benchmarks. Hazards and near miss reports increased 23% per cent between 2021 and 2022, and all premises are inspected at least annually to identify any hazards, risks, and incidences of non-compliance. The overall increase in accidents and incidents was due to the large increase in staff returning to office locations in 2022 after the lockdowns and restrictions of 2021.\n\nOne hundred and twenty of our largest premises were certified with the WELL Health & Safety Rating; an evidencebased, third-party certification that validates our efforts to address the hygiene and safety of our workspaces during COVID-19 and prepare our buildings for re-entry post-pandemic.\n\nOur regular Workplace Experience survey, conducted across 60 countries, returned our highest ever H&S and security satisfaction scores. The Health and Wellbeing index increased by 7%, and staff reported improved scores for work-life balance, wellbeing at home, and overall wellbeing. Staff also reported that our workplace design better supports their wellbeing and physical health compared with previous years.\n\nThroughout 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced its impact, with lockdowns and restrictions easing across most markets and staff returning to the office in greater numbers. That said, we still encourage flexible and hybrid work arrangements as part of our Future Work Now programme. A H&S online assessment tool is available for staff to assess their home working area for hazards, with a virtual assessments of the individual's work environment. All staff opting to work flexibly received an allowance to purchase ergonomic office equipment. Our work injury insurance covers all staff working from home.\n\nHealth, Safety & Security training is mandatory for all colleagues' training, and 2022 saw both our initial and annual refresher training packages completely updated and refreshed, with emphasis on mental health and wellbeing, as well as work from home aspects.\n\n## Major customers\n\nOur five largest customers together accounted for 1.9 per cent of our total operating income in the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## Major suppliers\n\nIn 2022, $4.3 billion was spent with approximately 11,700 suppliers. Of this, 74 per cent of the total spend was spent in the Asia region, with 18 per cent in Europe and the Americas, and 8 per cent in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFurthermore, 80 per cent of total spend in 2022 was with 465 suppliers. In addition, 80 per cent of carbon emissions were with 652 suppliers. In 2022, our five largest suppliers together accounted for 14 per cent of total spend, with the largest ten amounting to 21 per cent of total spend.\n\n## Supply chain management\n\nTo support the operation of our businesses we source a variety of goods and services governed through a third-party risk management framework which ensures that we follow the highest standards in terms of vendor selection, due diligence, and contract management.\n\nFor information about how the Group engages with suppliers on environmental and social matters, please see our Supplier Charter and Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Standard.\n\nAs set out under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Group is required to publish a Modern Slavery Statement annually. The Group's 2022 Modern Slavery Statement is issued at the same time as the Annual Report. This document gives further detail on the actions the Group has taken as it seeks to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its operations, financing and supply chain during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Supplier Charter and Supplier Diversity and Inclusion standard can be viewed at sc.com/suppliercharter and sc.com/supplierdiversity\n\n- Details of how we create value for our suppliers and other stakeholder\n\ngroups can be found on pages 54 to 63",

        "page_content": "## Product responsibility\n\nWe aim to design and offer products based on client needs to ensure fair treatment and outcomes for clients.\n\nThe Group has in place a risk framework, comprising policies and standards, to support these objectives in alignment with our Conduct Risk Framework. This framework covers sales practices, client communications, appropriateness and suitability, and post-sales practices. There are controls across all activities above and the controls are tested on a regular basis to provide assurance on the framework. As part of this, we ensure products sold are suitable for clients and comply with relevant laws and regulations. We also review our products on a periodic basis and refine them to keep them relevant to the changing needs of clients and regulators.\n\nWe have processes and guidelines specific to each of our client industries, to promptly resolve client complaints and understand and respond to client issues. Conduct considerations are given significant weighting in frontline incentive structures to drive the right behaviours.\n\nFor more information on our approach to product design, product pricing, treating customers fairly and protecting customers, and incentivising our frontline employees, see pages 55 and 56. For more information on fraud identification see page 121.\n\n## Safeguarding intellectual property rights\n\nThe Group has processes in place to manage the Group's trade mark rights and it respects third party intellectual property rights.\n\n## Group Code of Conduct\n\nThe Board has adopted a Group Code of Conduct (the Code) relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of business and this is supported by the Group's valued behaviours. This has been communicated to all directors and employees, all of whom are expected to observe high standards of integrity and fair dealing in relation to customers, employees and regulators in the communities in which the Group operates. Directors and employees are asked to recommit to the Code annually, and 99.5 per cent have completed the 2022 recommitment. All Board members have recommitted to the Code.\n\n## Managing environmental and social risk\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that high standards of responsible business are maintained and that an effective control framework is in place. This encompasses risk associated with clients' operations and their potential impact on the environment, including climate change, and local communities.\n\nThe Board recognises its responsibility to manage these risks and that failure to manage them adequately could have adverse impact on stakeholders as well as the Group. The Board, via the Culture and Sustainability Committee, reviews sustainability priorities, and oversees the development of, and delivery against, public commitments regarding the activities and/or businesses that the Group will or will not accept in alignment with our here for good brand promise.\n\nAt a management level, the Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible for Sustainable Finance, which incorporates E&S risk management. A cross-business Sustainability Forum is responsible for developing and delivering the Group's sustainability strategy, and in 2022 this Forum was chaired by the Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing from January to July, and from August onwards 2022 by the Chief Sustainability Officer.\n\nThe Group Responsibility and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC), chaired by the Group Head, Conduct, Financial Crime and Compliance, oversees management of the Reputational and Sustainability Risk profile for the Group, including oversight of our Position Statements and associated risk tolerance thresholds.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nWe collaborate with local partners to support social and economic development in communities across our markets. We are committed to sustainable social and economic development through our business, operations and communities. We aim to create more inclusive economies by sharing our skills and expertise and developing community initiatives that transform lives. We continue to support our communities through Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, our global initiative to tackle youth economic inclusion and enable the next generation to learn, earn and grow. For more information on Futuremakers, as well as our employee volunteering and community investment expenditure, please see pages 122 to 123 in the 'Sustainability' section and page 492.\n\n## ESG reporting guide\n\n## Compliance with Listing Rules\n\nWe comply with the requirements for environmental, social and governance reporting under Appendix 27 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules with the exception of A1.3 on hazardous waste and A1.6 on production and handling of hazardous waste and A2.5 on packaging and B2.2 on lost days due to work injury. As an office-based financial services provider, we generate minimal hazardous waste or packaging material. As such, these issues are not material and we do not report them.\n\nWe aim to design and offer products based on client needs to ensure fair treatment and outcomes for clients. The Group has in place a risk framework, comprising policies and standards, to support these objectives in alignment with our Conduct Risk Framework. This framework covers sales practices, client communications, appropriateness and suitability, and post-sales practice. As part of this, we ensure products sold are suitable for clients and comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Group does not manufacture products and therefore does not have a defined quality assurance process or recall procedures; nor does it sell or ship products that would be liable for return on health and safety grounds.",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn line with our 'comply or explain' obligation under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, we can confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in this Annual Report, except for one area: we do not fully disclose Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions as we currently focus on the sectors which are most carbon intensive. Further information is available on pages 79 to 80.\n\nIn line with the current UK Listing Rules requirements, our TCFD disclosures also take into account the implementation guidance included in the TCFD 2021 Annex.\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nThe European Union Sustainable Finance Taxonomy ('EU Taxonomy') is a classification system that establishes a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It has come into force as of 1 January 2022 for entities falling within the scope of disclosures.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank AG has assessed that implementation of the EU Taxonomy is not mandatory for Standard Chartered Bank AG at this stage given certain qualification thresholds; however, given the amendments introduced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') Standard Chartered Bank AG and Standard Chartered PLC (the Group) have commenced preparation to embed EU Taxonomy classifications and metrics and will continue to monitor expected policy developments from the European Commission concerning guidance on Taxonomy Alignment and Technical Screening Criteria to incrementally enhance our assessment and support reporting as required.\n\nIn this regard, the Group is developing digital capability to help facilitate reporting against the different taxonomies that are being developed across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. As the EU Taxonomy is the most advanced, the digital solution will adopt a rules-based approach to assess if a client and any client activity with the Group is in-scope and eligible for EU Taxonomy reporting. The intention is to expand this digital capability to include local taxonomy reporting and climate-related financial disclosures requirements.\n\nThe Group will consider taxonomy alignment in our business decisions, including at a client and transaction level, as well as more broadly at a sector strategy level. Given our footprint across Europe/UK, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, we need to continually review our ability to assess taxonomy-alignment based on information available from clients and through our due diligence process.\n\n## Environmental impact of our operations\n\nWe aim to minimise the environmental impact of our operations as part of our commitment to be a responsible company. We report on energy, water and non-hazardous waste data which become the basis of our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions management, as well as the targets we have set to reduce energy, water and waste consumption.\n\nDisclosures related to the Group's environmental policies as well as GHG, energy efficiency, water and waste performance metrics are included in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report on pages 74 and 75, and in the Supplementary Environment Data table on pages 489 to 491.\n\nOur reporting methodology is based upon the World Resources Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). We report on all emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Reports) Regulations.\n\nUsing conversion factors from the International Energy Agency 2021 Emissions Factors and the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, emissions are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e), encompassing the six Kyoto gases.\n\nScope 1 emissions are defined as arising from the consumption of energy from direct sources, during the use of property occupied by the Group. On-site combustion of fuels, including diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas, is recorded using meters, or where metering is not available, collated from fuel vendors' invoices. Emissions from the combustion of fuel in Group-operated transportation devices, as well as fugitive emissions, are excluded as being immaterial.\n\nScope 2 emissions are defined as arising from the consumption of indirect sources of energy, during the use of property occupied by the Group. Energy generated off-site in the form of purchased electricity, heat, steam or cooling, is collected as kilowatt hours consumed using meters or where metering is not available, collated from vendor's invoices.\n\nApplicable to both Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we include all indirect and direct sources of energy consumed by building services (amongst other activities) within the space occupied by the Group, leased or owned. This can include base building services under landlord control, but over which we typically hold a reasonable degree of influence.\n\nAll data centre facilities with conditioning systems and hardware remaining under the operational control of the Group are included in the reporting. This does not include energy used at outsourced data centre facilities which are captured under Scope 3, Category 1.\n\nScope 3 emissions occur as a consequence of the Group's activities but arising from sources not controlled by us. We have made great strides to enhance our Scope 3 GHG reporting for both upstream and downstream categories. Further information on the principles and methodologies used to calculate the GHG emissions of the Group can be found on pages 74 to 83 within the Strategic Report and in our reporting criteria document at sc.com/environmentcriteria.",

        "page_content": "## Reporting period\n\nThe reporting period of our Scope 1 and 2, Scope 3 Category 6 (business flights), Scope 3 Category 1 (data centres) and environmental resource efficiency data is from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. This allows sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions prior to the publication of results. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are assured by an independent body, Global Documentation, against the requirements of ISO14064.\n\nAccordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same time period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting.\n\nIt is noted that there is a one year lag on data used for financed emissions. This is a result of time taken for our clients to report their financial and carbon emission information. Therefore, the Group's baseline as released in 2021 utilised the 2020 year-end balance sheet date for client exposures, financial and carbon information and the 2022 updated financed emissions utilises the 2021 year end balances. We still refer to these as the 2022 and 2021 updates.\n\n## Assurance\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 emissions are independently assured by Global Documentation, in accordance with ISO 14064.\n\n|                                                            | Units                | 2022    | 2021    | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|---------|-----------|\n| Reporting coverage of data                                 |                      |         |         |           |\n| Headcount                                                  | No. of employees     | 83,266  | 81,957  | 83,657    |\n| Annual operating income from 1 October to 30 September     | $ million            | 15,863  | 14,541  | 15,233    |\n| Net internal area of occupied property                     | m 2                  | 946,234 | 998,571 | 1,050,414 |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (location based) 1                |                      |         |         |           |\n| Scope 1 & 2: 2                                             |                      |         |         |           |\n| Scope 1 emissions (combustion of fuels)                    | tCO2e                | 2,071   | 2,902   | 3,988     |\n| Scope 2 emissions (purchased electricity - location based) | tCO2e                | 47, 363 | 82,761  | 113,870   |\n| Scope 1 & 2 emissions (location based)                     | tCO2e                | 49,434  | 85,662  | 117,858   |\n| Scope 1 & 2 emissions (UK and offshore area only)          | tCO2e                | -       | -       | -         |\n| Scope 3:                                                   |                      |         |         |           |\n| Purchased goods (Global data centres)                      | tCO2e                | 706     | 43,132  | 29,562    |\n| Business travel (Air travel)                               | tCO2e                | 39,107  | 3,654   | 33,930    |\n| Total scope 1,2 and 3                                      | tCO2e                | 89,247  | 132,448 | 181,350   |\n| T GHG emissions - Intensity:                               |                      |         |         |           |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions/headcount                   | tCO2e/headcount/year | 1.07    | 1.62    | 2.17      |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions/operating income            | tCO2e/$m             | 5.63    | 9.11    | 11.91     |\n| Environmental resource efficiency                          |                      |         |         |           |\n| Energy                                                     |                      |         |         |           |\n| Indirect non-renewable energy consumption                  | GWh/year             | 142     | 142     | 184       |\n| Indirect renewable energy consumption                      | GWh/year             | 24      | 28      | 14        |\n| Direct non-renewable energy consumption                    | GWh/year             | 10      | 12      | 17        |\n| Direct renewable energy consumption                        | GWh/year             | 1       | 1       | 1         |\n| Energy consumption 3                                       | GWh/year             | 177     | 183     | 216       |\n| Energy consumption (UK and offshore area only)             | GWh/year             | 6       | 5       | -         |\n| Energy consumption/Headcount                               | kWH/headcount/year   | 2,129   | 2,233   | 2,544     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail on our environment performance, as well as associated assumptions and methodologies can be found on pages 74 to 83 within the Strategic Report and in our reporting criteria document at sc.com/environmentcriteria.",

Directors are in regular contact with our institutional shareholders and general presentations are made when we announce our financial results. The AGM presents an opportunity to communicate with all shareholders. Our shareholders are encouraged to receive our corporate documents electronically. The annual and interim financial statements, Notice of AGM and any dividend circulars are all available electronically. If you do not already receive your corporate documents electronically and would like to do so in future, please contact our registrars at the address on page 509. Shareholders are also able to vote electronically on the resolutions being put to the AGM through our registrars' website at investorcentre.co.uk.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nOur 2023 AGM will be held at 11:00am (UK time) (6:00pm Hong Kong time) on 3 May 2023. Further details regarding the format, location and business to be transacted will be disclosed within the 2023 Notice of AGM.\n\nOur 2022 AGM was held on 4 May 2022 at 11:00am (UK time) (6:00pm Hong Kong time). Special business at the meeting included the approval of the power to allot ECAT1 Securities for cash without certain formalities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll Board recommended resolutions were passed at the meeting; a shareholder requisitioned resolution concerning a proposed revision to the Group's net-zero pathway was not passed, the details of which can be viewed on our website at sc.com/agm\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nThe Group's non-audit services policy ('the policy') was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 22 September 2022. The policy is based on an overriding principle that, to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, the Group's auditor should only be used when either there is evidence that there is no alternative in terms of quality and there is no conflict with their duties as auditor. EY can be used where the work is required by a regulator or competent authority.\n\nThe policy clearly sets out the criteria for when the Audit Committee's prior written approval is required. The policy requires a conservative approach to be taken to the assessment of requests for EY to provide non-audit services. Subject to the overriding principle, the Audit Committee's view is that EY can be of value in a range of non-audit service activities and should be allowed to tender subject to the terms of the policy. The Group is required to take a conservative approach to interpreting the potential threats to auditor independence and requires commensurately robust safeguards against them.\n\nUK legislation and guidance from the FRC sets out threats to audit independence, including self-interest, self-review, familiarity, taking of a management role or conducting advocacy. In particular, maintaining EY's independence from the Group requires EY to avoid taking decisions on the Group's behalf. It is also recognised as essential that management retains the decision-making capability as to whether to act on advice given by EY as part of a non-audit service. This means not just the ability to action the advice given, but to have sufficient knowledge of the subject matter to be able to make a reasoned and independent judgement as to its validity.\n\nAll of this is contained within the policy.\n\nBy way of (non-exhaustive) illustration of the application of the principles set out in the policy, the following types of non-audit services are likely to be permissible under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of interim financial information and verification of interim profits - the Group would also extend this to work on investor circulars in most foreseeable circumstances\n- \u00b7 Extended audit or assurance work on financial information and/or financial or operational controls, where this work is closely linked to the audit engagement\n- \u00b7 Agreed upon procedures on materials within or referenced in the annual report of the Group or an entity within the Group\n- \u00b7 Internal control review services\n\nStrictly prohibited under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Bookkeeping, information technology and internal audit services\n- \u00b7 Corporate finance services, valuation services or litigation support\n- \u00b7 Tax or regulatory structuring proposals\n- \u00b7 Services where fees are paid on a contingent basis (in whole or in part)\n- \u00b7 Consulting services that actively assist in running the business in place of management as opposed to providing or validating information, which management then utilises in the operation of the business",

        "page_content": "The policy is not a prescribed list of non-audit services that EY is permitted to provide. Rather, each request for EY to provide non-audit services will be assessed on its own merits. The Audit Committee believes that such a case-by-case approach best accommodates (i) the need for the appropriate rigour and challenge to be applied to each request for EY to provide non-audit services while (ii) preserving sufficient flexibility for the Group to engage EY to provide non-audit services where they are able to deliver particular value to the Group and where the proposed services can be provided without compromising EY's objectivity and independence. To ensure that the Group will comply with a cap that limits fees on non-audit services provided by EY to under 70 per cent of the average Group audit fee from the previous three consecutive financial years, (which will apply from EY's fourth year of being the Group's external auditor), the policy requires that annual non-audit service fees are lower than 70 per cent of the average annual Group audit fee up to this time. The caps exclude audit related non-audit services and services carried out pursuant to law or regulation. For 2022, without deducting non-audit service fees which were required by law or regulation and performed by EY, the ratio was 0.3:1. Details relating to EY's remuneration as the Group statutory auditor and a description of the broad categories of the types of non-audit services provided by EY are given in Note 38 to the financial statements.\n\n## Auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the Group's statutory auditor, its effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, which includes monitoring our use of the auditors for non-audit services and the balance of audit and non-audit fees paid.\n\nFollowing an annual performance and effectiveness review of EY, it was felt that EY is considered to be effective, objective and independent in its role as Group statutory auditor.\n\nEach director believes that there is no relevant information of which our Group statutory auditor is unaware. Each has taken all steps necessary as a director to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group statutory auditor is made aware of any pertinent information.\n\nEY will be in attendance at the 2023 AGM. A resolution to re-appoint EY as auditor was proposed at the Company's 2022 AGM and was successfully passed.\n\nEY is a Public Interest Entity Auditor recognised in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Council Ordinance.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdrian de Souza Group Company Secretary 16 February 2023 Standard Chartered PLC\n\nRegistered No. 966425",

In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;\n- \u00b7 State whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;\n- \u00b7 Assess the Group and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control 1 as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsidiaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entities of the Group\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website.

This is principally the location from which a client relationship is managed, which may differ from where it is financially booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. This view reflects how the client segments and regions are managed internally.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and banks held at amortised cost in this Risk profile section include reverse repurchase agreement balances held at amortised cost, per Note 16 Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar secured lending and borrowing.\n\n## Credit Risk overview\n\nCredit Risk is the potential for loss due to the failure of a counterparty to meet its contractual obligations to pay the Group. Credit exposures arise from both the banking and trading books.\n\n## Stage 1\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL\n- \u00b7 Performing\n\n## Stage 2\n\n## Impairment model\n\nIFRS 9 mandates an impairment model that requires the recognition of expected credit losses (ECL) on all financial debt instruments held at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees.\n\n## Staging of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments that are not already credit-impaired are originated into stage 1 and a  12-month expected credit loss provision is recognised.\n\nInstruments will remain in stage 1 until they are repaid, unless they experience significant credit deterioration (stage 2) or they become credit-impaired (stage 3).\n\nInstruments will transfer to stage 2 and a lifetime expected credit loss provision is recognised when there has been a significant change in the Credit Risk compared to what was expected at origination.\n\nThe framework used to determine a significant increase in Credit Risk is set out below.\n\n## Stage 3\n\n- \u00b7 Lifetime expected credit loss\n- \u00b7 Performing but has exhibited significant increase in Credit Risk (SICR)\n- \u00b7 Credit-impaired\n- \u00b7 Non-performing\n\n## IFRS 9 expected credit loss principles and approaches\n\nThe main methodology principles and approach adopted by the Group are set out in the following table.\n\n| Title                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Supplementary information                                                                                                         | Page        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Approach for  determining  expected   credit losses | For material loan portfolios, the Group has adopted a statistical  modelling approach for determining expected credit losses that makes  extensive use of credit modelling.

This includes a $24 billion increase in Treasury and securities backed loans held to collect partly offset by a $13 billion reduction from riskweighted asset optimisation actions undertaken by CCIB and a $8 billion reduction from currency translation. Excluding the above, there was 3 per cent underlying loan growth, with growth in Trade partly offset by deleveraging in Wealth Management.\n\nExcluding reverse repurchase agreements, loans and advances to customers reduced by $5 billion. The reduction was primarily in the CPBB business and was mainly driven by a decrease in Private Bank exposure (largely from UK, Hong Kong, and Singapore in all classes) and Residential Mortgage segment in Korea (due to tightened Debt Service Ratio following new government guidelines). This was partly offset by $0.6 billion increase in Ventures from portfolio growth in Mox and the launch of Trust Bank in Singapore.\n\nDerivative exposures increased by $11.3 billion to $64 billion and investment debt securities increased by $9 billion to $172 billion. This was offset by a decrease of $14 billion of cash and balances at Central banks.\n\nOff-balance sheet instruments increased by $12 billion to $229 billion, driven by higher undrawn commitments which increased from $159 billion to $169 billion.\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022                        | 2022                   | 2022                                  | 2022                    | 2021                        | 2021                   | 2021                                  | 2021                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Credit risk management      | Credit risk management | Credit risk management                | Credit risk management  | Credit risk management      | Credit risk management | Credit risk management                | Credit risk management  |\n|                                                                                 | Maximum  exposure  $million | Collateral 8 $million  | Master  netting  agreements  $million | Net  exposure  $million | Maximum  exposure  $million | Collateral\u2078 $million   | Master  netting  agreements  $million | Net  exposure  $million |\n| On-balance sheet                                                                |                             |                        |                                       |                         |                             |                        |                                       |                         |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                              | 58,263                      |                        |                                       | 58,263                  | 72,663                      |                        |                                       | 72,663                  |\n| Loans and advances to banks\u00b9                                                    | 39,519                      | 978                    |                                       | 38,541                  | 44,383                      | 1,079                  |                                       | 43,304                  |\n| of which -

CPBB decreased by $5.2 billion due to mortgages and secured wealth. CCIB increased by $4 billion to $126 billion (31 December 2021: $122 billion). Off-balance sheet exposures increased by $15 billion primarily in undrawn commitments from increased customer demand.\n\nStage 2 financial instruments reduced to $28.1 billion (31 December 2021: $34.6 billion) due to exposure changes and transfers to stage 1 in CCIB, particularly in the Transport, telecoms and utilities and Energy sectors, partly offset by increase in commercial real estate, primarily in Asia.

The ECL provision in respect of debt securities measured at FVOCI is held within the OCI reserve\n- 3   These are off-balance sheet instruments. Only the ECL is recorded on-balance sheet as a financial liability and therefore there is no 'net carrying amount'. ECL allowances on off-balance sheet instruments are held as liability provisions to the extent that the drawn and undrawn components of loan exposures can be separately identified. Otherwise they will be reported against the drawn component\n- 4   Stage 1 ECL is not material\n- 5   Stage 3 gross includes $28 million (2021: $33 million) originated credit-impaired debt securities with impairment of $13 million (2021: Nil)",

All loans are assigned a CG, which is reviewed periodically and amended in light of changes in the borrower's circumstances or behaviour. CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 (credit-impaired) clients. Consumer and Business Banking portfolios are analysed by days past due and Private Banking by the type of collateral held.\n\n## Mapping of credit quality\n\nThe Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine the credit quality for loans.\n\n|                             | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Private Banking 1                      | Consumer &   Business Banking 4                |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit quality  description | Internal grade mapping                          | S&P external ratings  equivalent                | Regulatory PD range (%)                         | Internal ratings                       | Number of days past due                        |\n| Strong                      | 1A to 5B                                        | AAA/AA+ to BBB-/BB+0 to 0.425                   |                                                 | Class I and Class IV                   | Current loans (no past  dues nor impaired)     |\n| Satisfactory                | 6A to 11C                                       | BB+/BB to B-/CCC+ 2                             | 0.426 to 15.75                                  | Class II and Class III                 | Loans past due till  29 days                   |\n| Higher risk                 | Grade 12                                        | CCC+ to C 3                                     | 15.751 to 99.999                                | Stressed Assets   Group (SAG)  managed | Past due loans  30 days and over till  90 days |",

        "page_content": "The table overleaf sets out the gross loans and advances held at amortised cost, expected credit loss provisions and expected credit loss coverage by business segment and stage. Expected credit loss coverage represents the expected credit loss reported for each segment and stage as a proportion of the gross loan balance for each segment and stage.\n\n## Stage 1:\n\nStage 1 gross loans and advances to customers increased by $16 billion to $295 billion (31 December 2021: $279 billion) and represent an increase of 1 percentage point to 93 per cent of loans and advances to customers (31 December 2021: 92 per cent). The stage 1 coverage ratio remained at 0.2 per cent compared with 31 December 2021.\n\nIn CCIB, the proportion of stage 1 loans has increased to $126 billion, being 88 per cent (31 December 2021: 85 per cent), and the percentage of stage 1 loans rated as strong is higher at $90 billion, being 71 per cent (31 December 2021: 64 per cent) as the Group continues to focus on the origination of investment grade lending. This is primarily due to a $10.5 billion increase in exposures in Financing, insurance and non-banking from a few notable clients, $1.5 billion from rating upgrades in Transport, telecom and utilities clients, offset by $2.8 billion decrease in Manufacturing and $5.3 billion decrease in China Real Estate sector from repayments and downgrades into stage 2.\n\nCPBB stage 1 loans decreased by $5 billion to $129 billion (31 December 2021: $134 billion), mainly driven by a decrease in Private Bank exposure (largely from UK, Hong Kong, and Singapore in all classes), and a decrease in exposure of the Residential Mortgage segment in Korea (due to tightened Debt Service Ratio following new government guidelines). The proportion of loans and advances rated as strong increased to 97 per cent (31 December 2021: 96 per cent).\n\nVentures increased by $609 million to $691 million (31 December 2021: $82 million) from new lending in Mox Bank and the launch of Trust Bank in Singapore.\n\nCentral and other items segment increased by $17 billion to $39.1 billion (31 December 2021: $22.4 billion), due to higher levels of reverse repurchase agreements with Non Bank Financial Institutions and placements with governments.\n\n## Stage 2:\n\nStage 2 loans and advances to customers decreased by $4 billion to $13.0 billion (31 December 2021: $16.8 billion), primarily in CCIB due to exposure reductions and rating upgrades in Transport, telecom and utilities sectors, $1 billion decrease in the Energy sector, offset by increase in stage 2 in China commercial real estate. The proportion of stage 2 loans also reduced to 4.1 per cent (31 December 2021: 5.5 per cent).\n\nStage 2 loans to customers classified as 'Higher risk' was at $1.8 billion due to the downgrade of Pakistan. This was largely offset by downgrades to stage 3 primarily as a result of Sri Lanka and Ghana sovereign rating downgrade.\n\nCPBB stage 2 loans reduced by $0.2 billion primarily due to the transfers into stage 1 arising from the change in Credit Risk thresholds for certain credit card portfolios, largely in Asia.\n\nThe overall stage 2 cover ratio increased by 0.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 3.1 per cent). CCIB cover ratio increased to 2.8 per cent (31 December 2021: 2.3 per cent) primarily within higher risk exposures from sovereign downgrades offset by full release of COVID-19 overlay. CPBB stage 2 cover ratio decreased to 7.2 per cent (31 December 2021: 9.5 per cent), primarily driven by the release of $30 million of COVID-19 management overlays arising from the reassessment of residual risk after manifestation of such risk through individual impairments, partly offset by worsening macroeconomic variables and portfolio maturity in the China loan book.\n\n## Stage 3:\n\nGross stage 3 loans decreased by $0.3 billion to $7.8 billion (31 December 2021: $8.1 billion) as a result of upgrades and debt sales in CCIB which was offset by the downgrade of Sri Lanka and Ghana and China commercial real estate clients.\n\nCPBB stage 3 loans were materially unchanged at $1.5 billion, the $0.1 billion decrease was largely in Secured wealth and Mortgages portfolio.\n\nVentures stage 3 was $1 million primarily driven by downgrades in Mox Bank Hong Kong.\n\nCentral and other items stage 3 balances increased to $248 million (31 December 2021: Nil) due to downgrade of local currency loans to Sri Lanka Sovereign.",

The tables are presented for the Group, debt securities and other eligible bills.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe movement lines within the tables are an aggregation of monthly movements over the year and will therefore reflect the accumulation of multiple trades during the year. The credit impairment charge in the income statement comprises the amounts within the boxes in the table below, less recoveries of amounts previously written off. Discount unwind is reported in net interest income and related to stage 3 financial instruments only.\n\nThe approach for determining the key line items in the tables is set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Transfers - transfers between stages are deemed to occur at the beginning of a month based on prior month closing balances\n- \u00b7 Net remeasurement from stage changes - the remeasurement of credit impairment provisions arising from a change in stage is reported within the stage that the assets are transferred to. For example, assets transferred into stage 2 are remeasured from a 12-month to a lifetime expected credit loss, with the effect of remeasurement reported in stage 2. For stage 3, this represents the initial remeasurement from specific provisions recognised on individual assets transferred into stage 3 in the year\n- \u00b7 Net changes in exposures - new business written less repayments in the year. Within stage 1, new business written will attract up to 12 months of expected credit loss charges. Repayments of non-amortising loans (primarily within CCIB) will have low amounts of expected credit loss provisions attributed to them, due to the release of provisions over the term to maturity. In stages 2 and 3, the amounts principally reflect repayments although stage 2 may include new business written where clients are on non-purely precautionary early alert, are CG 12, or when non-investment grade debt securities are acquired.\n- \u00b7 Changes in risk parameters - for stages 1 and 2, this reflects changes in the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) of assets during the year, which includes the impact of releasing provisions over the term to maturity. It also includes the effect of changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year. In stage 3, this line represents additional specific provisions recognised on exposures held within stage 3\n- \u00b7 Interest due but not paid - change in contractual amount of interest due in stage 3 financial instruments but not paid, being the net of accruals, repayments and write-offs, together with the corresponding change in credit impairment\n\nChanges to ECL models, which incorporate changes to model approaches and methodologies, are not reported as a separate line item as these have an impact over a number of lines and stages.\n\n## Movements during the year\n\nStage 1 gross exposures increased by $35 billion to $720 billion when compared with 31 December 2021. $2 billion net increase was in CCIB, from new originations largely reverse repurchase agreements from a change in booking model and undrawn commitments. There was a $2 billion net increase in CPBB due to an increase in undrawn commitments of $7 billion. Debt securities increased by $9 billion in stage 1. The rest of the increase is largely Central and other items segment due to lending to Governments in Asia.\n\nTotal stage 1 provisions increased by $36 million to $645 million. CPBB increase is $36 million primarily in unsecured lending from net change in exposures, MEV changes and book growth in Asia offset by partial release of COVID-19 overlay. CCIB provisions increased by $31 million primarily due to new originations. Debt Security provision decreased by $42 million largely due to stage transfers following sovereign downgrades in Asia and Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStage 2 gross exposures decreased by $7 billion to $27 billion, primarily driven by $6 billion of net outflows from exposure changes and transfers to stage 1 in CCIB, particularly in the Energy and Transport, Telecom and Utilities sectors. CPBB exposures decreased by $1.9 billion, of which $1.3 billion was from the secured portfolio. Debt securities were broadly stable as exits were offset by the sovereign downgrade of Pakistan.\n\nStage 2 provisions decreased by $34 million to $618 million compared to 31 December 2021. $14 million decrease is from CCIB from full release of judgemental COVID-19 overlay of $102 million offset by the impact of sovereign downgrades and an increase in provisions for China commercial real estate. CPBB provisions decreased by $67 million, mainly in unsecured lending as a result of significant increase in credit risk thresholds which resulted in a decrease of ECL of $15 million and model changes resulted in ECL decrease of $7 million, and partial release of COVID-19 overlay.\n\nIn CCIB, gross stage 3 loans decreased by $0.4 billion compared with 31 December 2021 due to upgrades and repayments offset by sovereign downgrades in Africa and the Middle East and increased exposure to China commercial real estate. CCIB provisions decreased by $0.3 billion to $3.8 billion. CPBB total stage 3 loans decreased by $0.1 billion to $1.5 billion and provision decreased by $21 million driven by Personal loans and other unsecured lending portfolio as markets returned to normalised flows following the expiry of the majority of COVID-19 relief schemes in 2021 offset by increase in provisions secured portfolio. Debt Security Gross assets increased by $31 million to $144 million (31 December 2021: $113 million) due to new downgrade of Ghana Sovereign, offset by one corporate write-off.",

For example, a loan may have breached the PD thresholds and could also be on non-purely precautionary early alert; in this instance, the exposure is reported under 'Increase in PD'.\n\n|                                       | 2022                                           | 2022                                           | 2022                                           | 2022                                   | 2022                                   | 2022                                   | 2022            | 2022          | 2022        | 2022                  | 2022                  | 2022                  | 2022            | 2022          | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                                       | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Ventures        | Ventures      | Ventures    | Central & other items | Central & other items | Central & other items | Total           | Total         | Total       |\n|                                       | Gross  $million                                | ECL  $million                                  | Coverage  %                                    | Gross  $million                        | ECL  $million                          | Coverage  %                            | Gross  $million | ECL  $million | Coverage  % | Gross  $million       | ECL  $million         | Coverage  %           | Gross  $million | ECL  $million | Coverage  % |\n| Increase in PD                        | 13,620                                         | 192                                            | 1.4%                                           | 1,389                                  | 89                                     | 6.4%                                   | -

The management overlay relating to stage 1 and 2 assets was $210 million (31 December 2021: $344 million). There was a $212 million reduction in the COVID-19 element of the overlay, which now total $37 million, whereas the element relating to China commercial real estate sector increased by $78 million to $173 million.\n\nCCIB Stage 1 and 2 impairments of $148 million are driven by China commercial real estate downgrades including a $78 million increase for China commercial real estate overlay and sovereign downgrades in Africa and the Middle East which is offset by $102 million full release of COVID-19 overlay. Stage 3 impairment of $279 million is largely from China commercial real estate downgrades, clients' rating changes due to the Sri Lanka and Ghana Sovereign rating downgrades, offset by releases and repayments of a few notable clients.\n\nCPBB charge decreased by $20 million to $262 million (31 December 2021: $282 million). Stage 1 and 2 charge increased by $121 million to $150 million (31 December 2021: $29 million). Stage 3 charge decreased by $141 million to $112 million (31 December 2021: $253 million) as markets returned to normalised flows following the expiry of majority of COVID-19 relief schemes in 2021. In 2022, there were increased charges for Korea and Taiwan due to worsening macroeconomic forecasts, as well as China due to portfolio maturity and book growth. This was offset by a net release of $110 million (31 December 2021: $15 million) in management overlays and a $25 million release from significant increase in Credit Risk (SICR) methodology changes and model updates largely in the Asia region.\n\nVentures impairment charge increased by $13 million to $16 million (31 December 2021: $3 million) due to book growth in Mox Bank and Trust Bank Singapore.\n\nCentral and other items stage 1 and 2 impairments of $95 million was driven by the sovereign downgrade in Ghana and Pakistan. Stage 3 charge of $38 million was driven by the sovereign downgrade of Ghana and Sri Lanka.\n\n|                                                 | 2022                  | 2022              | 2022            | 2021 (Restated) 1     | 2021 (Restated) 1   | 2021 (Restated) 1   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                 | Stage 1 & 2  $million | Stage 3  $million | Total  $million | Stage 1 & 2  $million | Stage 3  $million   | Total  $million     |\n| Ongoing business portfolio                      |                       |                   |                 |                       |                     |                     |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 148                   | 279               | 427             | 23                    | (67)                | (44)                |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking 1          | 150                   | 112               | 262             | 29                    | 253                 | 282                 |\n| Ventures 1                                      | 13                    | 3                 | 16              | 3                     | -                   | 3                   |\n| Central & other items                           | 95                    | 38                | 133             | 23                    | (1)                 | 22                  |\n| Credit impairment charge                        | 406                   | 432               | 838             | 78                    | 185                 | 263                 |\n| Restructuring business portfolio                |                       |                   |                 |                       |                     |                     |\n| Others                                          | (2)                   | -                 | (2)             | (2)                   | (7)                 | (9)                 |\n| Credit impairment charge                        | (2)                   | -                 | (2)             | (2)                   | (7)                 | (9)                 |\n| Total credit impairment charge                  | 404                   | 432               | 836             | 76                    | 178                 | 254                 |\n\n## COVID-19 relief measures\n\nThe table below sets out the extent to which payment reliefs are in place across the Group's CPBB loan portfolio based on the amount outstanding at 31 December 2022. The accounting for temporary changes to loan contractual term is unchanged from that presented on page 220 of the 2021 Annual Report.\n\nCOVID-19 payment-related relief measures in most markets have now expired. The CPBB loans under payment relief schemes reduced to $237 million ($184 million is from secured products) compared to $1.2 billion at the end of 2021 and a peak of $8.9 billion in the first half of 2020, with the remaining balance concentrated in Asia. This represents 0.2 per cent of CPBB's gross loans and advances to customers, mainly in Hong Kong, China and India.\n\n|                                                                 | Total                 | Total             | Asia                  | Asia              | Africa & Middle East   | Africa & Middle East   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Segment 1 /Product                                              | Outstanding  $million | % of  portfolio 2 | Outstanding  $million | % of  portfolio 2 | Outstanding  $million  | % of  portfolio 2      |\n| Credit card & Personal loans                                    | 14                    | 0.1%              | 14                    | 0.1%              | -                      | -                      |\n| Mortgages & Auto                                                | 90                    | 0.1%              | 90                    | 0.1%              | -                      | -                      |\n| Business Banking                                                | 133                   | 1.3%              | 133                   | 1.4%              | -                      | -                      |\n| Total Consumer, Private & Business  Banking at 31 December 2022 | 237                   | 0.2%              | 237                   | 0.2%              | -                      | -                      |\n| Total Consumer, Private & Business  Banking at 31 December 2021 | 1,182                 | 0.9%              | 1,029                 | 0.9%              | 153                    | 3.1%                   |",

The reduction in loans was primarily driven by the following:\n\nIn CCIB, stage 3 loans decreased by $0.4 billion to $6.1 billion (31 December 2021: $6.5 billion) due to $2.4 billion outflows in debt sales, write-offs and material upgrades. This was offset by $2 billion inflows due to downgrades of Ghana and Sri Lanka Sovereign related clients as well as China commercial real estate clients.\n\nCPBB stage 3 loans were materially unchanged at $1.5 billion with $0.1 billion decrease from mortgages and secured wealth products.\n\nVentures loans increased to $1 million (31 December 2021: Nil) due to downgrades in Mox Bank Hong Kong.\n\nCentral and other items includes new inflows relating to local currency default of Sri Lanka.\n\n## Stage 3 cover ratio (audited)\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio measures the proportion of stage 3 impairment provisions to gross stage 3 loans, and is a metric commonly used in considering impairment trends. This metric does not allow for variations in the composition of stage 3 loans and should be used in conjunction with other Credit Risk information provided, including the level of collateral cover.\n\nThe balance of stage 3 loans not covered by stage 3 impairment provisions represents the adjusted value of collateral held and the net outcome of any workout or recovery strategies. Collateral provides risk mitigation to some degree in all client segments and supports the credit quality and cover ratio assessments post impairment provisions.\n\nFurther information on collateral is provided in the Credit Risk mitigation section.\n\nThe CCIB cover ratio increased by 1 per cent to 60 per cent (31 December 2021: 59 per cent) due to repayments and write-offs, which was offset by provisions taken on Ghana Sovereign downgrade and China commercial real estate clients.\n\nThe CPBB cover ratio increased by 2 per cent to 53 per cent (31 December 2021: 51 per cent) due to stage 3 loan balances reducing across secured wealth and mortgage portfolios.\n\n|                                | 2022                                                        | 2022                                              | 2022               | 2022                        | 2022            | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9                                            | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9                                   | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9   | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9            | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                | Corporate,  Commercial  &  Institutional  Banking  $million | Consumer,  Private &  Business  Banking  $million | Ventures  $million | Central &  Others  $million | Total  $million | Corporate,  Commercial  &  Institutional  Banking  $million | Consumer,  Private &  Business  Banking 1 $million | Ventures  $million | Central &  Others  $million | Total  $million    |\n| Gross credit-impaired          | 6,143                                                       | 1,453                                             | 1                  | 248                         | 7, 8 4 5        | 6,520                                                       | 1,575                                              | -                  | -                           | 8,095              |\n| Credit impairment provisions   | (3,662)                                                     | (776)                                             | (1)                | (18)                        | (4,457)         | (3,861)                                                     | (796)                                              | -                  | -                           | (4,657)            |\n| Net credit-impaired            | 2,481                                                       | 677                                               | -                  | 230                         | 3,388           | 2,659                                                       | 779                                                | -                  | -                           | 3,438              |\n| Cover ratio                    | 60%                                                         | 53%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 57%             | 59%                                                         | 51%                                                | -                  | -                           | 58%                |\n| Collateral ($ million)         | 956                                                         | 543                                               | -                  | -                           | 1,499           | 805                                                         | 641                                                | -                  | -                           | 1,446              |\n| Cover ratio (after collateral) | 75%                                                         | 91%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 76%             | 72%                                                         | 91%                                                | -                  | -                           | 75%                |\n\n## Credit-impaired (stage 3) loans and advances by geographic region\n\nStage 3 gross loans decreased by $0.3 billion to $7.8 billion (31 December 2021: $8.1 billion).

CCIB (audited)\n\nCollateral held against CCIB exposures amounted to $38 billion.\n\nCollateral taken for longer-term and sub-investment grade corporate loans improved to 53 per cent (31 December 2021: 49 per cent).\n\nOur underwriting standards encourage taking specific charges on assets and we consistently seek high-quality, investment-grade collateral.\n\n79 per cent of tangible collateral excluding reverse repurchase agreements (31 December 2021: 76 per cent) held comprises physical assets or is property based, and investment securities. Overall collateral increased by $8.7 billion to $38 billion (31 December 2021: $29 billion) due to an increase in reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nNon-tangible collateral, such as guarantees and standby letters of credit, is also held against corporate exposures, although the financial effect of this type of collateral is less significant in terms of recoveries. However, this is considered when determining the probability of default and other credit-related factors. Collateral is also held against offbalance sheet exposures, including undrawn commitments and trade-related instruments.",

The average LTV of the overall mortgage portfolio increased to 44.7 per cent (31 December 2021: 41.1 per cent) mainly from Hong Kong due to a drop in the Property Price Index. Hong Kong, which represents 40 per cent of the mortgage portfolio, has an average LTV of 52.6 per cent (31 December 2021: 43.8 per cent). All of our other key markets continue to have low portfolio LTVs (Korea, Singapore and Taiwan at 37.3 per cent, 42.9 per cent and 45.1 per cent respectively).\n\nAn analysis of LTV ratios by geography for the mortgage portfolio is presented in the table below.\n\n|                                             | 2022           | 2022                             | 2022                          | 2022            |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                              | Asia  %  Gross | Africa &   Middle East  %  Gross | Europe &  Americas   %  Gross | Total  %  Gross |\n| Less than 50 per cent                       | 60.9           | 43.0                             | 32.2                          | 60.1            |\n| 50 per cent to 59 per cent                  | 15.5           | 18.2                             | 19.2                          | 15.6            |\n| 60 per cent to 69 per cent                  | 9.8            | 16.8                             | 31.3                          | 10.2            |\n| 70 per cent to 79 per cent                  | 6.5            | 12.8                             | 14.8                          | 6.7             |\n| 80 per cent to 89 per cent                  | 3.6            | 5.1                              | 1.1                           | 3.6             |\n| 90 per cent to 99 per cent                  | 2.5            | 2.0                              | -                             | 2.4             |\n| 100 per cent and greater                    | 1.4            | 2.2                              | 1.3                           | 1.4             |\n| Average portfolio loan-to-value             | 44.4           | 54.3                             | 56.6                          | 44.7            |\n| Loans to individuals - mortgages ($million) | 83,954         | 1,388                            | 1,870                         | 87,212          |\n\n|                                             | 2021            | 2021                             | 2021                          | 2021             |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Amortised cost                              | Asia 1 %  Gross | Africa &   Middle East  %  Gross | Europe &  Americas   %  Gross | Total   %  Gross |\n| Less than 50 per cent                       | 68.2            | 27. 6                            | 16.8                          | 66.4             |\n| 50 per cent to 59 per cent                  | 11.6            | 18.6                             | 19.9                          | 11.9             |\n| 60 per cent to 69 per cent                  | 8.1             | 19.6                             | 37. 5                         | 8.9              |\n| 70 per cent to 79 per cent                  | 9.1             | 16.5                             | 1 7. 1                        | 9.4              |\n| 80 per cent to 89 per cent                  | 2.4             | 9.1                              | 8.7                           | 2.7              |\n| 90 per cent to 99 per cent                  | 0.5             | 4.8                              | -                             | 0.5              |\n| 100 per cent and greater                    | 0.1             | 3.8                              | -                             | 0.2              |\n| Average portfolio loan-to-value             | 40.5            | 61.9                             | 60.8                          | 41.1             |\n| Loans to individuals - mortgages ($million) | 85,765          | 1,651                            | 1,806                         | 89,222           |\n\n## Collateral and other credit enhancements possessed or called upon (audited)\n\nThe Group obtains assets by taking possession of collateral or calling upon other credit enhancements (such as guarantees).

These credit default swaps are accounted for as financial guarantees as per IFRS 9 as they will only reimburse the holder for an incurred loss on an underlying debt instrument. The Group continues to hold the underlying assets referenced in the credit default swaps and it continues to be exposed to related Credit Risk and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk on these assets.\n\n## Credit linked notes\n\nThe Group has issued credit linked notes for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $13.5 billion (31 December 2021: $10.0 billion). The Group continues to hold the underlying assets for which the credit linked notes provide mitigation.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivative transactions. Credit Risk mitigation for derivative financial instruments is set out in page 285.\n\n## Off-balance sheet exposures\n\nFor certain types of exposure, such as letters of credit and guarantees, the Group obtains collateral such as cash depending on internal Credit Risk assessments, as well as in the case of letters of credit holding legal title to the underlying assets should a default take place.\n\n## Other portfolio analysis\n\nThis section provides maturity analysis by credit quality by industry and industry and retail products analysis by region.\n\n## Contractual maturity analysis of loans and advances by client segment\n\nLoans and advances to the CCIB segment remain predominantly short-term, with $98.3 billion or 68 per cent (31 December 2021: $95.5 billion or 66 per cent) maturing in less than one year.\n\nLoans and advances to banks decreased by $4.9 billion to $39.5 billion (31 December 2021: $44.4 billion) of which 96 per cent mature in less than one year (31 December 2021: 98 per cent).\n\nThe CPBB short-term book of one year or less is stable at 25 per cent (31 December 2021: 26 per cent) and long term book over five years increased to 64 per cent (31 December 2021: 62 per cent) of the total portfolio.\n\n|                                               | 2022                       | 2022                        | 2022                      | 2022            |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                                | One year or less  $million | One to five years  $million | Over five years  $million | Total  $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | 98,335                     | 34,635                      | 10,789                    | 143,759         |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | 33,365                     | 14,161                      | 84,731                    | 132,257         |\n| Ventures                                      | 548                        | 162                         | -                         | 710             |\n| Central & other items                         | 39,373                     | -                           | 8                         | 39,381          |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers         | 171,621                    | 48,958                      | 95,528                    | 316,107         |\n| Impairment provisions                         | (4,767)                    | (574)                       | (119)                     | (5,460)         |\n| Net loans and advances to customers           | 166,854                    | 48,384                      | 95,409                    | 310,647         |\n| Net loans and advances to banks               | 38,105                     | 1,211                       | 203                       | 39,519          |\n\n|                                               | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9           | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9            | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9          | 2021 (Restated)\u00b9   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Amortised cost                                | One year or less  $million | One to five years  $million | Over five years  $million | Total  $million    |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | 95,454                     | 36,953                      | 11,299                    | 143,706            |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | 35,900                     | 16,783                      | 85,093                    | 1 3 7, 7 76        |\n| Ventures                                      | 91                         | -                           | -                         | 91                 |\n| Central & other items                         | 22,318                     | 224                         | 7                         | 22,549             |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers         | 153,763                    | 53,960                      | 96,399                    | 304,122            |\n| Impairment provisions                         | (5,057)                    | (462)                       | (135)                     | (5,654)            |\n| Net loans and advances to customers           | 148,706                    | 53,498                      | 96,264                    | 298,468            |\n| Net loans and advances to banks               | 43,274                     | 955                         | 154                       | 44,383             |",

        "page_content": "## Credit quality by industry\n\n## Loans and advances\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's amortised cost portfolio by industry on a gross, total credit impairment and net basis.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, gross loans and advances increased by $12.0 billion to $316 billion (31 December 2021: $304 billion), of which $16.8 billion was from Central and other items segments, offset by $5.5 billion in CPBB. CCIB was stable at $144 billion with increase in stage 1 loans offset by a decrease in stage 2 loans.\n\nStage 1 loans increased by $16.0 billion to $295.2 billion (31 December 2021: $279.2 billion), due to an increase in Lending to Governments notably Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea. In CPBB, loans decreased by $4.5 billion to $129.8 billion (31 December 2021: $134.4 billion), mainly driven by a decrease in Private Bank exposure (largely from UK, Hong Kong and Singapore in all classes), and a decrease in exposure of the Residential Mortgage segment in Korea (due to tightened Debt Service Ratio following new government guidelines).  This is offset by an increase in credit card portfolio of $1 billion. In CCIB, loans were broadly stable due to $10.5 billion increase in exposures in Financing, insurance and non-banking from a few notable clients, $1.5 billion increase in Transport, telecom and utilities from upgrades offset by $2.8 billion decrease in Manufacturing and $5.3 billion decrease in Commercial real estate sector from repayments.\n\nStage 2 loans decreased by $3.8 billion to $13 billion (31 December 2021: $16.8 billion) largely due to CCIB, $2.6 billion reductions in Transport, telecom and utilities from upgrades to Stage 1 and repayments, $1.2 billion decrease in Energy. This was offset by an increase in Commercial real estate sector from accounts being placed on Early Alert Non Purely Precautionary and higher risk categories.\n\nStage 3 loans reduced by $0.3 billion to $7.8 billion (31 December 2021: $8.1 billion) of which CCIB and Central and other items are broadly flat as the effects of the sovereign downgrades of Ghana and Sri Lanka are largely offset by repayments and upgrades. CPBB stage 3 loans reduced in Secured wealth and Mortgages portfolios.\n\n|                                              | 2022                     | 2022                                  | 2022

industry and region.\n\nIn the CCIB and Central and other items segment, our largest industry exposures are to Government, Financing, insurance and non-banking and Manufacturing with each constituting at least 10 per cent of CCIB and Central and other items loans and advances to customers.\n\nFinancing, insurance and non-banking industry clients are mostly investment-grade institutions and this lending forms part of the liquidity management of the Group. The Manufacturing sector group is spread across a diverse range of industries, including automobiles and components, capital goods, pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences, technology hardware and equipment, chemicals, paper products and packaging, with lending spread over 3,330 clients.\n\nThe Group provides loans to Commercial real estate counterparties of $16.9 billion, which represents 9 per cent of total customer loans and advances. In total, $9.1 billion of this lending is to counterparties where the source of repayment is substantially derived from rental or sale of real estate and is secured by real estate collateral. The remaining Commercial real estate loans comprise working capital loans to real estate corporates, loans with non-property collateral, unsecured loans and loans to real estate entities of diversified conglomerates. The average LTV ratio of the performing book Commercial real estate portfolio has decreased to 49 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in 2021. The proportion of loans with an LTV greater than 80 per cent has decreased to 1 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in 2021. The China commercial real estate portfolio is being closely monitored and is being separately disclosed on page 268.",

The total net on and off-balance sheet exposure for CCIB decreased by $7.8bn to $251.3 billion (31 December 2021: $259.2 billion).\n\nStage 2 vulnerable and cyclical sector loans decreased by $1.8 billion to $5.6 billion (31 December 2021: $7.4 billion). This was primarily driven by a decrease in the Aviation sector from stage upgrades and in Oil and Gas sectors from repayments, which was partly offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate.\n\nStage 3 vulnerable and cyclical sector loans increased by $0.4 billion to $4 billion (31 December 2021: $3.6 billion), mainly from China commercial real estate clients and the Oil and Gas sector.\n\nConstruction sector is included in this section and prior year tables are re-presented.",

The proportion of the loan book rated as Higher Risk also increased compared to 2021 and the proportion rated as strong reduced from 38 per cent to 15 per cent as the majority of non-credit impaired developer clients were placed on non-purely precautionary early alert.\n\nThe Group continues to hold a judgemental management overlay (see page 276), which increased by $78 million to $173 million compared to 2021, reflecting the increased uncertainty and deterioration in the portfolio. $5 million (2021: $3 million) of this overlay is held against off-balance sheet exposures. Total coverage of the non-credit impaired portfolio is 10 per cent or 2 per cent excluding the judgemental overlay.\n\nThe Group is further indirectly exposed to China commercial real estate through its associate investment in China Bohai Bank.

However, for some of the key countries, countryspecific models have also been developed.\n\nThe calibration of forward-looking information is assessed at a country or region level to take into account local macroeconomic conditions.\n\nRetail expected credit loss models are country and product specific given the local nature of the CPBB business.\n\nFor less material retail portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophisticated approaches based on historical roll rates or loss rates:\n\n- \u00b7 For medium-sized retail portfolios, a roll rate model is applied, which uses a matrix that gives the average loan migration rate between delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multiplication is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n- \u00b7 For smaller retail portfolios, loss rate models are applied. These use an adjusted gross charge-off rate, developed using monthly write-off and recoveries over the preceding 12 months and total outstanding balances.\n- \u00b7 While the loss rate models do not incorporate forwardlooking information, to the extent that there are significant changes in the macroeconomic forecasts an assessment will be completed on whether an adjustment to the modelled output is required.\n\nFor a limited number of exposures, proxy parameters or approaches are used where the data is not available to calculate the origination PDs for the purpose of applying the SICR criteria; or for some retail portfolios where a full history of LGD data is not available, estimates based on the loss experience from similar portfolios are used. The use of proxies is monitored and will reduce over time.\n\nThe following processes are in place to assess the ongoing performance of the models:\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly model monitoring that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predictions and actual outcomes against approved thresholds.\n- \u00b7 Annual independent validations of the performance of material models by Group Model Valuation (GMV); an abridged validation is completed for non-material models.\n\n## Application of lifetime\n\nExpected credit loss is estimated based on the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk. For the majority of exposures this equates to the maximum contractual period. For retail credit cards and corporate overdraft facilities however, the Group does not typically enforce the contractual period, which can be as short as one day. As a result, the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk for these instruments reflects their behavioural life, which incorporates expectations of customer behaviour and the extent to which Credit Risk management actions curtail the period of that exposure. The average behavioural life for retail credit cards is between 3 and 6 years across our footprint markets.\n\nIn 2022, the behavioural life for corporate overdraft facilities was re-estimated using recent data, and it was confirmed that the existing lifetime of 24 months remains appropriate.\n\n## Composition of credit impairment provisions (audited)\n\nThe table below summarises the key components of the Group's credit impairment provision balances at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021.\n\nTotal ECL provisions before management judgements includes model performance post model adjustments and the impact of multiple economic scenarios. Total modelled ECL provisions, which also includes judgemental post model adjustments and management overlays, were 26 per cent (31 December 2021: 23 per cent) of total credit impairment provisions at 31 December 2022. 17 per cent of the modelled ECL provisions at 31 December 2022 related to judgemental adjustments compared with 25 per cent at 31 December 2021.\n\n| 31 December 2022                                  | Corporate,  Commercial &  Institutional  Banking   $million   | Consumer,  Private &  Business   Banking   $million   | Ventures   $million   | Central &   other items   $million   | Total   $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Modelled ECL provisions (base forecast)           | 505                                                           | 556                                                   | 12                    | 194                                  | 1,267              |\n| Modelled Impact of multiple economic scenarios 1  | 38                                                            | 6                                                     | -

PMAs will be removed when the models are updated to correct for the identified model issue or the estimates return to being within the monitoring thresholds.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, PMAs have been applied for 9 models out of the total of 172 models. In aggregate, the PMAs reduce the Group's impairment provisions by $60 million (0.5 per cent of modelled provisions) compared with a $17 million increase at 31 December 2021, and primarily relate to a $17 million decrease for multiple economic scenarios in CCIB and a $24 million decrease in ECL for Malaysian CPBB Business Clients.\n\nOn top of these PMAs, a separate judgemental management adjustment that covers risk not captured by the models has also been applied. These adjustments are summarised below.\n\n|                                               | 2022   $million   | 2021   $million   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Model performance PMAs                        |                   |                   |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | (22)              | 24                |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | (38)              | (15)              |\n| Central & other items                         | -                 | 8                 |\n| Total model performance PMAs                  | (60)              | 17                |\n\n## Key assumptions and judgements in determining expected credit loss\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking information\n\nThe evolving economic environment is a key determinant of the ability of a bank's clients to meet their obligations as they fall due. It is a fundamental principle of IFRS 9 that the provisions banks hold against potential future Credit Risk losses should depend, not just on the health of the economy today, but should also take into account potential changes to the economic environment. For example, if a bank were to anticipate a sharp slowdown in the world economy over the coming year, it should hold more provisions today to absorb the credit losses likely to occur in the near future.\n\nTo capture the effect of changes to the economic environment, the PDs and LGDs used to calculate ECL incorporate forward-looking information in the form of forecasts of the values of economic variables and asset prices that are likely to have an effect on the repayment ability of the Group's clients.\n\nThe 'base forecast' of the economic variables and asset prices is based on management's view of the five-year outlook, supported by projections from the Group's in-house research team and outputs from a third-party model that project specific economic variables and asset prices. The research team takes consensus views into consideration, and senior management review projections for some core country variables against consensus when forming their view of the outlook. For the period beyond five years, management utilises the in-house research view and third-party model outputs, which allow for a reversion to long-term growth rates or norms. All projections are updated on a quarterly basis.",

Global GDP is forecast to grow by less than 3 per cent in 2023. World GDP growth averaged 3.7 per cent for the 10 years prior to COVID-19 (between 2010 and 2019). The multitude of headwinds that have faced most economies in 2022 are likely to persist in the months ahead. However, a recovery in growth is expected to take hold in H2 2023.\n\nThe balance of risks to the 2023 outlook is to the downside. They include the impact from higher inflation and interest rates, ongoing geopolitical tensions, renewed lockdowns/ restrictions to movement from the spread of COVID-19 and severe corrections in property sectors in key countries.\n\nWhile the quarterly Base Forecasts inform the Group's strategic plan, one key requirement of IFRS 9 is that the assessment of provisions should consider multiple future economic environments. For example, the global economy may grow more quickly or more slowly than the Base Forecast, and these variations would have different implications for the provisions that the Group should hold today. As the negative impact of an economic downturn on credit losses tends to be greater than the positive impact of an economic upturn, if the Group sets provisions only on the ECL under the Base Forecast it might maintain a level of provisions that does not appropriately capture the range of potential outcomes. To address this property of skewness (or non-linearity), IFRS 9 requires reported ECL to be a probability-weighted ECL, calculated over a range of possible outcomes.\n\nTo assess the range of possible outcomes the Group simulates a set of 50 scenarios around the Base Forecast, calculates the ECL under each of them and assigns an equal weight of 2 per cent to each scenario outcome. These scenarios are generated by a Monte Carlo simulation, which addresses the challenges of crafting many realistic alternative scenarios in the many countries in which the Group operates by means of a model, which produces these alternative scenarios while considering the degree of historical uncertainty (or volatility)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSingapore GDP\n\nYoY%\n\nLong-term growth = GDP growth expected for 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nobserved from Q1 1990 to Q3 2022 around economic outcomes and how these outcomes have tended to move in relation to one another (or correlation). This naturally means that each of the 50 scenarios do not have a specific narrative, although collectively they explore a range of hypothetical alternative outcomes for the global economy, including scenarios that turn out better than expected and scenarios that amplify anticipated stresses.\n\nThe GDP graphs below illustrate the shape of the Base Forecast for key footprint markets in relation to prior periods' actuals. The long-term growth rates are based on the pace of economic expansion expected for 2030. The tables below provide a summary of the Group's Base Forecast for these markets. The peak/trough amounts show the highest and lowest points within the Base Forecast.\n\nChina's growth is expected to accelerate to 5.8 per cent in 2023 from less than 3.5 per cent in 2022. Consumption should start to recover as the country gradually eases its zero-COVID stance and starts to reopen. Recently announced policy support measures for the real estate sector are also expected to lift the outlook for the broader economy in H2 2023. Like China, Hong Kong's GDP growth, is expected to improve to around 2.5 per cent in 2023 from a contraction of 3 per cent in 2022 on the gradual relaxation of travel curbs and socialdistancing measures and the much-improved labour market. However, the upside will be limited on the expected weakness in the external sector. Major economies such as the US and Europe are forecast to slow sharply on account of monetary policy tightening and high inflation. Slowing external demand will also be a key factor in Singapore's GDP growth easing to 2.8 per cent in 2023 from around 3.5 per cent in 2022 and Korea's growth easing to around 2 per cent from 2.7 per cent. Growth in India is also forecast to slow with GDP expected to grow by 5.5 per cent in FY24 (ending March 2024) from 7 per cent in FY23. Fading pent-up demand (especially in the services sector), rising interest rates, limited real wage hikes and like other countries in the region easing global demand will weigh on activity.\n\nThe slowdown in world GDP growth in the near term will translate to a softening in the growth of demand for commodities in 2023. Brent Crude oil prices are expected to average around $91 in 2023 compared to around $100 in 2022.",

The Monte Carlo approach has the advantage that it generates many plausible alternative scenarios that cover our global footprint. The Monte Carlo model was redeveloped over 2022 to increase the range of scenarios that the model forecasts.\n\nThe redeveloped Monte Carlo model was implemented in Q4 2022 and forecasted a wider range of scenarios. The total amount of non-linearity calculated as the difference between the probability-weighted ECL calculated by the Monte Carlo model and the unweighted base forecast ECL is $50 million (31 December 2021: $4 million). The CCIB and Central and other items portfolios accounted for $44 million of the calculated non-linearity with the remaining $6 million attributable to CPBB portfolios. As the non-linearity calculated for the CPBB portfolios remained relatively low a judgemental PMA of $34 million has been applied.\n\nThe impact of multiple economic scenarios (which includes the post model adjustment for multiple economic scenarios) on stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 modelled ECL is set out in the table below together with the management overlay.\n\n|                                                | Base forecast  $million   |   Multiple  economic  scenarios 1 $million |   Management  overlays and  other  judgemental  adjustments   $million | Total   modelled   ECL 2 $million   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2022 | 1,267                     |                                         84 |                                                                    229 | 1,580                               |\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2021 | 1,000                     |                                         55 |                                                                    351 | 1,406                               |\n\nThe average expected credit loss under multiple scenarios is 7 per cent higher than the expected credit loss calculated using only the most likely scenario (the Base Forecast). Portfolios that are more sensitive to non-linearity include those with greater leverage and/or a longer tenor, such as Project and Shipping Finance portfolios. Other portfolios display minimal non-linearity owing to limited responsiveness to macroeconomic impacts for structural reasons such as significant collateralisation as with the CPBB mortgage portfolios.\n\n## Judgemental adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group held judgemental adjustments for ECL as set out in the table below. All of the judgemental adjustments have been determined after taking account of the model performance PMAs reported and they are reassessed quarterly. They are reviewed and approved by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee.\n\n|                                    | Corporate,                                      | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 31 December 2022                   | Commercial &  Institutional  Banking   $million | Mortgages   $million                   | Credit Cards   $million                | Other    $million                      | Total    $million                      |\n| Judgemental post model adjustments | -

        "page_content": "## Post model adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, judgemental post model adjustments to increase ECL by $44 million (31 December 2021: $7 million) have been applied to certain CPBB models. $34 million (31 December 2021: $nil) of this relates to multiple economic scenarios. The remainder is primarily to hold back releases of ECL identified from model monitoring breaches because moratoria and other support schemes have suppressed observed defaults. These will be released when the observed defaults normalise.\n\n## Management overlays\n\nCCIB\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 overlay of $102 million at 31 December 2021 has been fully released in 2022 and no overlay is held at 31 December 2022.\n\n## China commercial real estate\n\nChinese property developers continue to experience liquidity issues, triggered by government policy changes aimed at deleveraging the property sector and ensuring property developers have the financial ability to complete residential properties under construction. The government's 'three red lines' matrix was introduced in August 2020 to tighten the funding conditions for property developers by limiting the growth rate in external debt. With additional controls on sales of properties to end buyers (e.g. mortgage lending control, pricing control, eligibility control) and on restricting developers' ability to access cash from 'escrow accounts' with cash paid by retail residential buyers, the cashflow of developers has been significantly squeezed. Also, with capital markets reacting negatively to the tightening policies, we have seen greater volatility in bond pricing and reduced access to capital markets liquidity for developers. As such, some developers have faced/are facing difficulties in servicing and repaying financing obligations.\n\nThe Group's loans and advances to China commercial real estate clients was $3.2 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $3.7 billion). Client level analysis continues to be done, with the high-risk clients being placed on purely precautionary or non-purely precautionary early alert. Given the evolving nature of the risks in the China commercial real estate sector, a management overlay of $173 million (31 December 2021: $95 million) has been taken by estimating the impact of further deterioration to those clients placed on early alert.\n\n## Sri Lanka\n\nDue to the ongoing economic uncertainty following the Sri Lanka Sovereign default in the first half of 2022, a judgemental overlay of $9 million (31 December 2021: $nil) is held against modelled stage 3 exposures in Sri Lanka that have not yet been individually assessed for impairment.\n\n## CPBB\n\nWhile industry wide government COVID-19 relief measures have ended for most markets, there are a few markets where either the schemes have recently ended or limited reliefs are still available. At 31 December $21 million (31 December 2021: $147 million) was held for residual COVID-19 related risks in these portfolios.\n\nOverlays of $16 million (31 December 2021: $nil) have also been applied to capture operating environment challenges, in part caused by rising interest rates in certain markets, and the impact of sovereign defaults in the last quarter of 2022, both of which are not fully captured in the modelled outcomes.\n\n## Stage 3 assets\n\nCredit-impaired assets managed by Stressed Asset Risk incorporate forward-looking economic assumptions in respect of the recovery outcomes identified, and are assigned individual probability weightings. These assumptions are not based on a Monte Carlo simulation but are informed by the Base Forecast.\n\n## Sensitivity of expected credit loss calculation to macroeconomic variables\n\nThe ECL calculation relies on multiple variables and is inherently non-linear and portfolio-dependent, which implies that no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in the macroeconomic variables. The Group has conducted a series of analyses with the aim of identifying the macroeconomic variables which might have the greatest impact on the overall ECL. These encompassed single variable and multi-variable exercises, using simple up/ down variation and extracts from actual calculation data, as well as bespoke scenario design assessments.\n\nThe primary conclusion of these exercises is that no individual macroeconomic variable is materially influential. The Group believes this is plausible as the number of variables used in the ECL calculation is large. This does not mean that macroeconomic variables are uninfluential; rather, that the Group believes that consideration of macroeconomics should involve whole scenarios, as this aligns with the multi-variable nature of the calculation.\n\nThe Group faces downside risks in the operating environment related to the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. To explore this, a sensitivity analysis of ECL was undertaken to explore the effect of slower economic recoveries across the Group's footprint markets. Two downside scenarios were considered. The first scenario is based on the Bank of England's 2022 regulatory Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS 2022) and is a deep synchronised global downturn characterised by significantly higher commodity prices relative to base, inflation and interest rates. In the second more modest downside scenario, inflation in advanced economies surprises to the upside in the very near term as the supply-chain crisis intensifies and this prompts additional monetary tightening. Financial markets weaken with bond yields spiking and equities falling sharply. The deterioration in sentiment also leads to adjustments in property markets. Advanced economies are shocked more than emerging markets in the second scenario.",

For example 2023 is from Q1 2023 to Q4 2023\n\nThe total modelled stage 1 and 2 ECL provisions (including both on and off-balance sheet instruments) would be approximately $32 million higher under the Advanced Economy Downturn scenario, and $459 million higher under the ACS 2022 scenario than the baseline ECL provisions (which excluded the impact of multiple economic scenarios and management overlays which may already capture some of the risks in these scenarios). The proportion of stage 2 assets would increase from 3.1 per cent in the base case to 3.3 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively under the Advanded Economy Downturn and ACS 2022 scenarios. This includes the impact of exposures transferring to stage 2 from stage 1 but does not consider an increase in stage 3 defaults.\n\nUnder both scenarios the majority of the increase in CCIB came from the main corporate and project finance portfolios in the UAE and Hong Kong being impacted. For the CPBB portfolios most of the increases came from the unsecured retail portfolios with the Taiwan Personal Loans and Singapore Credit Cards portfolios impacted.\n\nThere was no material change in modelled stage 3 provisions as these primarily relate to unsecured CPBB exposures for which the LGD is not sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic forecasts. There is also no material change for non-modelled stage 3 exposures as these are more sensitive to client specific factors than to alternative macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe actual outcome of any scenario may be materially different due to, among other factors, the effect of management actions to mitigate potential increases in risk and changes in the underlying portfolio.",

reporting date to the risk of default at origination. Whether a change in the risk of default is significant or not is assessed using quantitative and qualitative criteria. These quantitative significant deterioration thresholds have been separately defined for each business and where meaningful are consistently applied across business lines.\n\nAssets are considered to have experienced SICR if they have breached both relative and absolute thresholds for the change in the average annualised lifetime probability of default over the residual term of the exposure.\n\nThe absolute measure of increase in Credit Risk is used to capture instances where the IFRS 9 PDs on exposures are relatively low at initial recognition as these may increase by several multiples without representing a significant increase in credit risk. Where IFRS 9 PDs are relatively high at initial recognition, a relative measure is more appropriate in assessing whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, as the IFRS 9 PDs increase more quickly.\n\nThe SICR thresholds have been calibrated based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Stability - the thresholds are set to achieve a stable stage 2 population at a portfolio level, trying to minimise the number of accounts moving back and forth between stage 1 and stage 2 in a short period of time\n\n- \u00b7 Accuracy - the thresholds are set such that there is a materially higher propensity for stage 2 exposures to eventually default than is the case for stage 1 exposures\n- \u00b7 Dependency from backstops - the thresholds are stringent enough such that a high proportion of accounts transfer to stage 2 due to movements in forward-looking IFRS9 PDs rather than relying on backward-looking backstops such as arrears\n- \u00b7 Relationship with business and product risk profiles - the thresholds reflect the relative risk differences between different products, and are aligned to business processes\n\nFor CCIB clients, the relative threshold is a 100 per cent increase in IFRS 9 PD and the absolute change in IFRS 9 PD is between 50 and 100 bps.\n\nFor Consumer and Business Banking clients, portfolio specific quantitative thresholds in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE and Taiwan have been introduced in 2022 for credit cards and one personal loan portfolio. The thresholds include relative and absolute increases in IFRS 9 PD with average lifetime IFRS 9 PD cut-offs for those exposures that are within a range of customer utilisation limits (for credit cards) and remaining tenor (for personal loans) and differentiate between exposures that are current and those that are 1 to 29 days past due.",

Certain countries have a higher absolute threshold reflecting the lower default rate within their personal loan portfolios compared with the Group's other personal loan portfolios.\n\nPrivate Banking clients are assessed qualitatively, based on a delinquency measure relating to collateral top-ups or sell-downs.\n\nDebt securities originated before 1 January 2018 with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securities to stage 2. Debt securities originated after 1 January 2018 apply the same approach and thresholds as for CCIB clients.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nQualitative factors that indicate that there has been a significant increase in credit risk include processes linked to current risk management, such as placing loans on non-purely precautionary early alert.\n\n## Backstop\n\nAcross all portfolios, accounts that are 30 or more days past due (30 DPD) on contractual payments of principal and/or interest that have not been captured by the criteria above are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nExpert credit judgement may be applied in assessing significant increase in credit risk to the extent that certain risks may not have been captured by the models or through the above criteria. Such instances are expected to be rare, for example due to events and material uncertainties arising close to the reporting date.\n\n## CCIB clients\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nExposures are assessed based on both the absolute and the relative movement in the IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date as described above.\n\nTo account for the fact that the mapping between internal credit grades (used in the origination process) and IFRS 9 PDs is non-linear (e.g. a one-notch downgrade in the investment grade universe results in a much smaller IFRS 9 PD increase than in the sub-investment grade universe), the absolute thresholds have been differentiated by credit quality at origination, as measured by internal credit grades being investment grade or sub-investment grade.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nAll assets of clients that have been placed on early alert (for non-purely precautionary reasons) are deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nAn account is placed on non-purely precautionary early alert if it exhibits risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requiring closer monitoring, supervision or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of repayment prospects and the likelihood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of position within the industry, concerns over management's ability to manage operations, weak/deteriorating operating results, liquidity strain and overdue balances, among other factors.\n\nAll client assets that have been assigned a CG12 rating, equivalent to 'Higher risk', are deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. Accounts rated CG12 are primarily managed by relationship managers in the CCIB unit with support from SAG  for certain accounts.. All CCIB clients are placed in CG12 when they are 30 DPD unless they are granted a waiver through a strict governance process.\n\n## Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nMaterial portfolios (defined as a combination of country and product, for example Hong Kong mortgages, Taiwan credit cards) for which a statistical model has been built, are assessed based on both the absolute and relative movement in the IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date as described previously in page 270. For these portfolios, the original lifetime IFRS 9 PD term structure is determined based on the original Application Score or Risk Segment of the client.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nAccounts that are 30 days past due (DPD) that have not been captured by the quantitative criteria are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios, which are modelled based on a roll-rate or loss-rate approach, SICR is primarily assessed through the 30 DPD trigger.\n\n## Private Banking clients\n\nFor Private Banking clients, SICR is assessed by referencing the nature and the level of collateral against which credit is extended (known as 'Classes of Risk').\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nFor all Private Banking classes, in line with risk management practice, an increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred where margining or loan-to-value covenants have been breached.\n\nFor Class I assets (lending against diversified liquid collateral), if these margining requirements have not been met within 30 days of a trigger, a significant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred.",

        "page_content": "For Class I and Class III assets (real-estate lending), a significant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred where the bank is unable to 'sell down' the applicable assets to meet revised collateral requirements within five days of a trigger.\n\nClass II assets are typically unsecured or partially secured, or secured against illiquid collateral such as shares in private companies. Significant credit deterioration of these assets is deemed to have occurred when any early alert trigger has been breached.\n\n## Debt Securities\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nFor debt securities originated before 1 January 2018, the bank is utilising the low Credit Risk simplified approach, where debt securities with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securities are allocated to stage 2. Debt securities originated after 1 January 2018 are assessed based on the absolute and relative movements in IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nDebt securities utilise the same qualitative criteria as the CCIB client segments, including being placed on early alert or being classified as CG12.\n\n## Assessment of credit-impaired financial assets Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\nThe core components in determining credit-impaired expected credit loss provisions are the value of gross chargeoff and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or loss provisions are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay through the normal process. Recovery of unsecured debt post credit impairment is recognised based on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to thirdparty institutions. Release of credit impairment provisions for secured loans is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full (release of full provision), or the provision is higher than the loan outstanding (release of the excess provision).\n\n## CCIB, and Private Banking clients\n\nCredit-impaired accounts are managed by the Group's specialist recovery unit, Stressed Assets Risk (SAR). Where any amount is considered irrecoverable, a stage 3 credit impairment provision is raised. This stage 3 provision is the difference between the loan-carrying amount and the probability-weighted present value of estimated future cash flows, reflecting a range of scenarios (typically the best, worst and most likely recovery outcomes). Where the cashflows include realisable collateral, the values used will incorporate the impact of forward-looking economic information.\n\nThe individual circumstances of each client are considered when SAR estimates future cashflows and the timing of future recoveries which involves significant judgement. All available sources, such as cashflow arising from operations, selling assets or subsidiaries, realising collateral or payments under guarantees are considered. In any decision relating to the raising of provisions, the Group attempts to balance economic conditions, local knowledge and experience, and the results of independent asset reviews.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nWhere it is considered that there is no realistic prospect of recovering a portion of an exposure against which an impairment provision has been raised, that amount will be written off.\n\n## Governance and application of expert credit judgement in respect of expected credit losses\n\nThe Group's Credit Policy and Standards framework details the requirements for continuous monitoring to identify any changes in credit quality and resultant ratings, as well as ensuring a consistent approach to monitoring, managing and mitigating credit risks. The framework aligns with the governance of ECL estimation through the early recognition of significant deteriorations in ratings which drive stage 2 and 3 ECL.\n\nThe models used in determining expected credit losses are reviewed and approved by the Group Credit Model Assessment Committee (CMAC) which is appointed by the Model Risk Committee. CMAC has the responsibility to assess and approve the use of models and to review all IFRS 9 interpretations related to models. CMAC also provides oversight on operational matters related to model development, performance monitoring and model validation activities including standards and regulatory matters.\n\nPrior to submission to CMAC for approval, the models are validated by GMV, a function which is independent of the business and the model developers. GMV's analysis comprises review of model documentation, model design and methodology, data validation, review of the model development and calibration process, out-of-sample performance testing, and assessment of compliance review against IFRS 9 rules and internal standards.\n\nA quarterly model monitoring process is in place that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predictions and actual outcomes against approved thresholds. Where a model's performance breaches the monitoring thresholds, an assessment of whether a PMA is required to correct for the identified model issue is completed.\n\nKey inputs into the calculation and resulting expected credit loss provisions are subject to review and approval by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee (IIC) which is appointed by the Group Risk Committee. The IIC consists of senior representatives from Risk, Finance, and Group Economic Research. It meets at least twice every quarter, once before the models are run to approve key inputs into the calculation, and once after the models are run to approve the expected credit loss provisions and any judgemental overrides that may be necessary.",

Under the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the Traded Risk Framework brings together Market Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and Algorithmic Trading. Traded Risk Management is the core risk management function supporting marketfacing businesses, predominantly Financial Markets and Treasury Markets.\n\n## Market Risk (audited)\n\nMarket Risk is the potential for fair value loss due to adverse moves in financial markets. The Group's exposure to Market Risk arises predominantly from the following sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Trading book:\n- -  The Group provides clients access to financial markets, facilitation of which entails the Group taking moderate Market Risk positions. All trading teams support client activity. There are no proprietary trading teams. Hence, income earned from Market Risk-related activities is primarily driven by the volume of client activity rather than risk-taking\n- \u00b7 Non-trading book:\n- -  The Treasury Markets desk is required to hold a liquid assets buffer, much of which is held in high-quality marketable debt securities\n- -  The Group has capital invested and related income streams denominated in currencies other than US dollars. To the extent that these are not hedged, the Group is subject to Structural Foreign Exchange Risk which is reflected in reserves\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices regarding Market Risk management is provided in the Principal Risks section (page 304).\n\nThe primary categories of Market Risk for the Group are:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk: arising from changes in yield curves and implied volatilities on interest rate options\n- \u00b7 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk: arising from changes in currency exchange rates and implied volatilities on foreign exchange options\n- \u00b7 Commodity Risk: arising from changes in commodity prices and implied volatilities on commodity options; covering energy, precious metals, base metals and agriculture as well as commodity baskets\n- \u00b7 Credit Spread Risk: arising from changes in the price of debt instruments and credit-linked derivatives, driven by factors other than the level of risk-free interest rates\n- \u00b7 Equity Risk: arising from changes in the prices of equities, equity indices, equity baskets and implied volatilities on related options\n\n## Market Risk movements (audited)\n\nValue at Risk (VaR) allows the Group to manage Market Risk across the trading book and most of the fair valued nontrading books.\n\nThe average level of total trading and non-trading VaR in 2022 was $52.5 million, 4.2 per cent lower than 2021 ($54.8 million). The actual level of total trading and non-trading VaR as at the end of 2022 was $55.8 million, 28.6 per cent higher than 2021 ($43.4 million), due to an increase in market volatility in H2 2022, driven by a number of Central Banks increasing interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nFor the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2022 was $18.0 million, 4.6 per cent higher than 2021 ($17.2 million). Trading activities have remained relatively unchanged, and client driven.\n\n## Daily value at risk (VaR at 97.5%, one day) (audited)\n\n|                              | 2022              | 2022            | 2022          | 2022               | 2021              | 2021           | 2021          | 2021               |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Trading 1  and non-trading 2 | Average  $million | High  $ million | Low  $million | Year End  $million | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million |\n| Interest Rate Risk           | 27.8              | 42.1            | 21.0          | 24.7               | 31.3              | 68.3           | 16.4          | 26.0               |\n| Credit Spread Risk           | 34.2              | 47.1            | 20.3          | 32.9               | 34.0              | 97. 6          | 14.8          | 21.5               |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk        | 6.5               | 10.3            | 4.8           | 6.8                | 7. 3              | 19.0           | 4.2           | 7. 0               |\n| Commodity Risk               | 7.0               | 11.9            | 3.5           | 8.3                | 4.5               | 10.4           | 2.3           | 3.6                |\n| Equity Risk                  | 0.1               | 0.2             | -             | 0.1                | 1.3               | 1.7            | 1.0           | 1.4                |\n| Total                        | 52.5              | 64.1            | 40.3          | 55.8               | 54.8              | 140.7          | 30.7          | 43.4               |\n\n|                       | 2022              | 2022           | 2022          | 2022               | 2021              | 2021           | 2021          | 2021               |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Trading 1             | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million |\n| Interest Rate Risk    | 8.1               | 11.7           | 5.3           | 9.0                | 7. 6              | 10.2           | 5.2           | 7. 2               |\n| Credit Spread Risk    | 9.5               | 14.9           | 5.0           | 8.7                | 8.6               | 19.2           | 4.2           | 6.2                |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk | 6.5               | 10.3           | 4.8           | 6.8                | 7. 3              | 19.0           | 4.2           | 7. 0               |\n| Commodity Risk        | 7.0               | 11.9           | 3.5           | 8.3                | 4.5               | 10.4           | 2.3           | 3.6                |\n| Equity Risk           | -                 | -              | -             | -                  | -                 | -              | -             | -                  |\n| Total                 | 18.0              | 24.4           | 12.6          | 21.8               | 1 7. 2            | 28.4           | 12.3          | 15.3               |",

Group exceptions occurred on:\n\n- \u00b7 9 March: When risk assets rallied on hope of a truce agreement between Russia and Ukraine\n- \u00b7 29 March: When oil and base metal prices fell on the prospect of further ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, and following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China\n- \u00b7 25 April: When risk assets fell following an announcement by Chinese authorities of expanded COVID-19 testing requirements amidst rising cases\n- \u00b7 29 September: When the Bank of England intervened in the gilts market to protect UK pension funds with Liability Driven Investment (LDI) exposures\n- \u00b7 4 October: When the Reserve Bank of Australia raised Australian interest rates by less than expected. US Treasury yields fell and the USD currency depreciated\n- \u00b7 25 October: When the new UK Prime Minister was appointed and Sterling appreciated sharply\n- \u00b7 26 October: When new economic data indicated that the Federal Reserve would slow anticipated US interest rate rises. USD yields fell and the USD currency depreciated",

An analysis has been performed on these exposures to assess the impact of a 1 per cent fall in the US dollar exchange rates, adjusted to incorporate the impacts of correlations of these currencies to the US dollar. The impact on the positions above would be an increase of $421 million (2021: $399 million). Changes in the valuation of these positions are taken to reserves. For analysis of the Group's capital position and requirements, refer to the Capital Review (page 320).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk is the potential for loss in the event of the default of a derivative counterparty, after taking into account the value of eligible collaterals and risk mitigation techniques. The Group's counterparty credit exposures are included in the Credit Risk section.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments Credit Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivative transactions.\n\nIn addition, the Group enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) with counterparties where collateral is deemed a necessary or desirable mitigant to the exposure. Cash collateral includes collateral called under a variation margin process from counterparties if total uncollateralised mark-tomarket exposure exceeds the threshold and minimum transfer amount specified in the CSA. With certain counterparties, the CSA is reciprocal and requires us to post collateral if the overall mark-to-market values of positions are in the counterparty's favour and exceed an agreed threshold.\n\n## Liquidity and Funding Risk\n\nLiquidity and Funding Risk is the risk that the Group may not have sufficient stable or diverse sources of funding to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\nThe Group's Liquidity and Funding Risk framework requires each country to ensure that it operates within predefined liquidity limits and remains in compliance with Group liquidity policies and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group achieves this through a combination of setting Risk Appetite and associated limits, policy formation, risk measurement and monitoring, prudential and internal stress testing, governance and review.\n\nDespite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the Group has maintained resilience and retained a robust liquidity position. The Group continues to focus on improving the quality and diversification of its funding mix, and remains committed to supporting its clients.\n\n## Primary sources of funding (audited)\n\nThe Group's funding strategy is largely driven by its policy to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in all geographic locations and for all currencies. This is done to ensure the Group can meet all of its obligations as they fall due. The Group's funding profile is therefore well diversified across different sources, maturities and currencies.\n\nThe Group's assets are funded predominantly by customer deposits, supplemented with wholesale funding, which is diversified by type and maturity.\n\nThe Group maintains access to wholesale funding markets in all major financial centres in which it operates. This seeks to ensure that the Group has market intelligence, maintains stable funding lines and can obtain optimal pricing when performing Interest Rate Risk management activities.\n\nIn 2022, the Group issued approximately $5.2 billion of senior debt securities, $0.75 billion of subordinated debt securities and $1.25 billion of Additional Tier 1 securities from its holding company (HoldCo) Standard Chartered PLC (2021: $6.8 billion of senior debt securities, $1.2 billion of subordinated debt securities and $2.75 billion of Additional Tier 1 securities). In the next 12 months, approximately $5.4 billion of the Group's senior debt, subordinated debt and Additional Tier 1 securities in total are either falling due for repayment contractually or callable by the Group.",

The Group maintained strong liquidity ratios despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group LCR was 147 per cent (2021: 143 per cent), with a surplus to both Board-approved Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nAdequate liquidity was held across our footprint to meet all local prudential LCR requirements where applicable.\n\nThe LCR is a regulatory requirement set to ensure the Group has sufficient unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs in a 30-calendar-day liquidity stress scenario.\n\n|                          | 2022   $million   | 2021   $million   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Liquidity buffer         | 1 7 7, 0 3 7      | 172,178           |\n| Total net cash outflows  | 120,720           | 120,788           |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio | 147%              | 143%              |\n\n## Stressed coverage\n\nThe Group intends to maintain a prudent and sustainable funding and liquidity position, in all countries and currencies, such that it can withstand a severe but plausible liquidity stress.\n\nThe Group's approach to managing liquidity and funding is reflected in the Board-level Risk Appetite Statement which includes the following:\n\n'The Group should have sufficient stable and diverse sources of funding to meet its contractual and contingent obligations as they fall due.'\n\nThe Group's internal liquidity stress testing framework covers the following stress scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Standard Chartered-specific - which captures the liquidity impact from an idiosyncratic event affecting Standard Chartered only with the rest of the market assumed to be operating normally;\n- \u00b7 Market wide - which captures the liquidity impact from a market-wide crisis affecting all participants in a country, region or globally; and\n\n- \u00b7 Combined - which assumes both Standard Charteredspecific and Market-wide events affect the Group simultaneously and hence is the most severe scenario.\n\nAll scenarios include, but are not limited to, modelled outflows for retail and wholesale funding, off-balance sheet funding risk, cross-currency funding risk, intraday risk, franchise risk and risks associated with a deterioration of a firm's credit rating.\n\nStress testing results show that a positive surplus was maintained under all scenarios at 31 December 2022, i.e. respective countries are able to survive for a period of time as defined under each scenario. The results take into account currency convertibility and portability constraints while calculating the liquidity surplus at Group level.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank's credit ratings as at 31 December 2022 were A+ with stable outlook (Fitch), A+ with stable outlook (S&P) and A1 with stable outlook (Moody's). As of 31 December 2022, the estimated contractual outflow of a three-notch long-term ratings downgrade is $1.5 billion.",

        "page_content": "## External wholesale borrowing\n\nThe Board sets a risk limit to prevent excessive reliance on wholesale borrowing. Within the definition of wholesale borrowing, limits are applied to all branches and operating subsidiaries in the Group and as at the reporting date, the Group remained within Board Risk Appetite.\n\n## Advances-to-deposits ratio\n\nThis is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. An advancesto-deposits ratio below 100 per cent demonstrates that customer deposits exceed customer loans as a result of the emphasis placed on generating a high level of funding from customers.\n\nThe Group's advances-to-deposits ratio has decreased by 1.7 per cent to 57.4 per cent, driven by a reduction of 2 per cent in customer deposits and 5 per cent in customer loans and advances.\n\n|                                           | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Total loans and advances to customers 1,2 | 271,897          | 285,922          |\n| Total customer accounts 3                 | 473,383          | 483,861          |\n| Advances-to-deposits ratio                | 57.4%            | 59.1%            |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe NSFR is a PRA regulatory requirement that stipulates institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to an assumed duration of their assets and off-balance sheet activities over a one-year horizon. It is the ratio between the amount of available stable funding (ASF) and the amount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF factors are applied to balance sheet liabilities and capital, based on their perceived stability and the amount of stable funding they provide. Likewise, RSF factors are applied to assets and off-balance sheet exposures according to the amount of stable funding they require. The regulatory requirements for NSFR are to maintain a ratio of at least 100 per cent. The average ratio for the past four quarters is 129.6 per cent.\n\n## Liquidity pool\n\nThe liquidity value of the Group's LCR eligible liquidity pool at the reporting date was $177 billion. The figures in the table below account for haircuts, currency convertibility and portability constraints, and therefore are not directly comparable with the consolidated balance sheet. A liquidity pool is held to offset stress outflows as defined in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (CRR) part of the PRA rulebook.\n\n|                                                                | 2022           | 2022                             | 2022                         | 2022            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                | Asia  $million | Africa &   Middle East  $million | Europe &  Americas  $million | Total  $million |\n| Level 1 securities                                             |                |                                  |                              |                 |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                             | 34,101         | 1,066                            | 36,522                       | 71,689          |\n| Central banks, governments/public sector entities              | 50,881         | 2,712                            | 23,680                       | 77,273          |\n| Multilateral development banks and international organisations | 3,510          | 837                              | 10,843                       | 15,190          |\n| Other                                                          | 37             | 7                                | 1,430                        | 1,474           |\n| Total Level 1 securities                                       | 88,529         | 4,622                            | 72,475                       | 165,626         |\n| Level 2A securities                                            | 4,044          | 139                              | 6,033                        | 10,216          |\n| Level 2B securities                                            | 71             | 21                               | 1,103                        | 1,195           |\n| Total LCR eligible assets                                      | 92,644         | 4,782                            | 79,611                       | 1 7 7, 0 3 7    |\n\n|                                                                | 2021           | 2021                             | 2021                         | 2021            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                | Asia  $million | Africa &   Middle East  $million | Europe &  Americas  $million | Total  $million |\n| Level 1 securities                                             |                |                                  |                              |                 |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                             | 28,076         | 890                              | 46,973                       | 75,939          |\n| Central banks, governments/public sector entities              | 40,328         | 2,096                            | 27, 3 8 9                    | 69,813          |\n| Multilateral development banks and international organisations | 7, 8 1 2       | 356                              | 7, 3 6 6                     | 15,534          |\n| Other                                                          | -              | -                                | 478                          | 478             |\n| Total Level 1 securities                                       | 76,216         | 3,342                            | 82,206                       | 161,764         |\n| Level 2A securities                                            | 3,447          | 186                              | 5,047                        | 8,680           |\n| Level 2B securities                                            | 114            | -                                | 1,620                        | 1,734           |\n| Total LCR eligible assets                                      | 79,777         | 3,528                            | 88,873                       | 172,178         |",

Contractual maturities do not necessarily reflect actual repayments or cashflows.\n\nWithin the tables below, cash and balances with central banks, interbank placements and investment securities that are fair value through other comprehensive income are used by the Group principally for liquidity management purposes.\n\nAs at the reporting date, assets remain predominantly short-dated, with 61 per cent maturing in less than one year. The less than three-month cumulative net funding gap improved by $22 billion from the previous year.\n\n|                                                    | 2022                         | 2022

include repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of $58.6 billion\n- 5   Senior debt maturity profiles are based upon contractual maturity, which may be later than call options over the debt held by the Group\n\n## Behavioural maturity of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe cashflows presented in the previous section reflect the cashflows that will be contractually payable over the residual maturity of the instruments. However, contractual maturities do not necessarily reflect the timing of actual repayments or cashflow. In practice, certain assets and liabilities behave differently from their contractual terms, especially for short-term customer accounts, credit card balances and overdrafts, which extend to a longer period than their contractual maturity. On the other hand, mortgage balances tend to have a shorter repayment period than their contractual maturity date. Expected customer behaviour is assessed and managed on a country basis using qualitative and quantitative techniques, including analysis of observed customer behaviour over time.",

The financial liability balances in the table below will not agree with the balances reported in the consolidated balance sheet as the table incorporates all contractual cashflows, on an undiscounted basis, relating to both principal and interest payments. Derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'On demand' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.\n\nWithin the 'More than five years and undated' maturity band are undated financial liabilities, the majority of which relate to subordinated debt, on which interest payments are not included as this information would not be meaningful, given the instruments are undated. Interest payments on these instruments are included within the relevant maturities up to five years.\n\n|                                                    | 2022                         | 2022

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThe following table provides the estimated impact to a hypothetical base case projection of the Group's earnings under the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 A 50 basis point parallel interest rate shock (up and down) to the current market-implied path of rates, across all yield curves\n- \u00b7 A 100 basis point parallel interest rate shock (up) to the current market-implied path of rates, across all yield curves\n\nThese interest rate shock scenarios assume all other economic variables remain constant. The sensitivities shown represent the estimated change to a hypothetical base case projected net interest income (NII), plus the change in interest rate implied income and expense from FX swaps used to manage banking book currency positions, under the different interest rate shock scenarios.\n\nThe base case projected NII is based on the current marketimplied path of rates and forward rate expectations. The NII sensitivities below stress this base case by a further 50 or 100bps. Actual observed interest rate changes will lag behind market expectation. Accordingly, the shocked NII sensitivity does not represent a forecast of the Group's net interest income.\n\nThe interest rate sensitivities are indicative stress tests and based on simplified scenarios, estimating the aggregate impact of an unanticipated, instantaneous parallel shock across all yield curves over a one-year horizon, including the time taken to implement changes to pricing before becoming effective. The assessment assumes that the size and mix of the balance sheet remain constant and that there are no specific management actions in response to the change in rates. No assumptions are made in relation to the impact on credit spreads in a changing rate environment.\n\nSignificant modelling and behavioural assumptions are made regarding scenario simplification, market competition, pass-through rates, asset and liability re-pricing tenors, and price flooring. The assumption that interest rates of all currencies and maturities shift by the same amount concurrently, and that no actions are taken to mitigate the impacts arising from this are considered unlikely. Reported sensitivities will vary over time due to a number of factors including changes in balance sheet composition, customer behaviour and risk management strategy, the interest rates assumed in setting the base case and other market conditions. Therefore, while the NII sensitivities are a relevant measure of the Group's interest rate exposure, they should not be considered an income or profit forecast.\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2022               | 2022               | 2022               | 2022               | 2022               | 2022                            | 2022            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginning   of the period of: | USD bloc  $million | HKD bloc  $million | SGD bloc  $million | KRW bloc  $million | CNY bloc  $million | Other  currency  bloc  $million | Total  $million |\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                  | 80                 | 20                 | 40                 | 50                 | 30                 | 150                             | 370             |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                  | (80)               | (20)               | (40)               | (60)               | (30)               | (140)                           | (370)           |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                 | 160                | 40                 | 90                 | 100                | 50                 | 300                             | 740             |\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2021               | 2021               | 2021               | 2021               | 2021               | 2021                            | 2021            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginning   of the period of: | USD bloc  $million | HKD bloc  $million | SGD bloc  $million | KRW bloc  $million | CNY bloc  $million | Other  currency  bloc  $million | Total  $million |\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                  | 200                | 150                | 70                 | 50                 | 50                 | 140                             | 660             |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                  | (210)              | (170)              | (70)               | (40)               | (50)               | (130)                           | (670)           |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                 | 380                | 280                | 130                | 80                 | 90                 | 300                             | 1,260           |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 50 basis points to increase projected NII by $370 million. The equivalent impact from a parallel decrease of 50 basis points would result in a reduction in projected NII of $370 million. The Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 100 basis points to increase projected NII by $740 million.\n\nThe benefit from rising interest rates is primarily from reinvesting at higher yields and from assets re-pricing faster and to a greater extent than deposits. NII sensitivity in all scenarios has decreased versus 31 December 2021. The change in NII sensitivity reflects updates to the Group's base case scenario to factor in higher interest rates as at 31 December 2022. In addition, NII sensitivities have reduced due to the migration of the HKD mortgage book from HIBOR to Prime rate, the dampening effect of USD hedging strategies intended to provide short term income certainty and smooth longer term NII volatility, and due to changes in modelling assumptions to reflect expected re-pricing activity on Retail and Transaction Banking current accounts and savings accounts in the current interest rate environment.",

The Group can be impacted from a range of operational risks which are inherent in the Group's strategy and business model.\n\n## Operational and Technology Risk profile\n\nRisk management practices help the business grow safely and ensures governance and management of Operational and Technology Risk through the delivery and embedding of effective frameworks and policies, together with continuous oversight and assurance.\n\nThe Group continues to ensure the operational and technology risk framework supports the business and functions in effectively managing risk and controls within risk appetite to meet their strategic objectives.\n\nOverall, the Group's Operational Risk profile has remained stable with the quality of risk understanding and identification improving. Operational and Technology Risks remain heightened in areas such as Fraud, Data Management, and Information and Cyber Security. Other focus risk areas are Third Party Risk,\n\nTechnology Risk, People Risk and Change Management. The Group continues to enhance its operational resilience and defences against these risks, as well as continue to monitor impacts of the ongoing pandemic, through vigorous enhancement programmes.\n\nDigitalisation and wider technological improvements remain a key focus for the Group, to keep pace with new business developments whilst ensuring control frameworks and Risk Appetite evolve accordingly.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nIn line with regulatory expectations, the Standard Chartered PLC Board has approved the Group's Important Business Services, Impact Tolerance Statements and the Operational Resilience self-assessment. By 31 March 2025, the authorities expect the Group to complete mapping, continue scenario testing to identify vulnerabilities, remediate identified vulnerabilities, and embed sustainable governance, assurance and testing.\n\n## Operational Risk events and losses\n\nOperational losses are one indicator of the effectiveness and robustness of the non-financial risk control environment.\n\nThe Group's profile of operational loss events in 2022 and 2021 is summarised in the table below.

The Group adds value to clients and the communities in which they operate by taking and managing appropriate levels of risk, which in turn generates returns for shareholders.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) enables the Group to manage enterprise-wide risks, with the objective of maximising risk-adjusted returns while remaining within our Risk Appetite. The ERMF has been designed with the explicit goal of improving the Group's risk management, and since its launch in January 2018, it has been embedded across the Group and rolled out to its branches and subsidiaries 1 .\n\nThe ERMF is reviewed annually and the latest version is effective from January 2023.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nThe Group's risk culture provides guiding principles for the behaviours expected from our people when managing risk. The Board has approved a risk culture statement that encourages the following behaviours and outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 An enterprise-level ability to identify and assess current and future risks, openly discuss these and take prompt actions.\n- \u00b7 The highest level of integrity by being transparent and proactive in disclosing and managing all types of risks.\n- \u00b7 A constructive and collaborative approach in providing oversight and challenge, and taking decisions in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Everyone to be accountable for their decisions and feel safe in using their judgement to make these considered decisions.\n\nWe acknowledge that banking inherently involves risk-taking and undesired outcomes will occur from time to time; however, we shall take the opportunity to learn from our experience and formalise what we can do to improve. We expect managers to demonstrate a high awareness of risk and control by self-identifying issues and managing them in a manner that will deliver lasting change.\n\n## Strategic risk management\n\nThe Group approaches strategic risk management as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\nBy conducting an impact analysis on the risk profile from\n\n- growth plans, strategic initiatives and business model vulnerabilities, with the aim of proactively identifying and managing new risks or existing risks that need to be reprioritised as part of the strategy review process.\n- \u00b7 By confirming that growth plans and strategic initiatives can be delivered within the approved Risk Appetite and/or proposing additional Risk Appetite for Board consideration as part of the strategy review process. Stress testing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 By validating the Corporate Plan against the approved or proposed Risk Appetite Statement to the Board. The Board approves the strategy review and the five-year Corporate Plan with a confirmation from the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) that it is aligned with the ERMF and the Group Risk Appetite Statement where projections allow.\n- \u00b7 Country Risk management approach and Country Risk reviews are used to ensure the country limits and exposures are reasonable and in line with Group strategy, country strategy, and the operating environment, considering the identified risks.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\n## Senior Managers Regime 2\n\nRoles and responsibilities under the ERMF are aligned to the objectives of the Senior Managers Regime. The GCRO is responsible for the overall development and maintenance of the Group's ERMF and for identifying material risk types to which the Group may be potentially exposed. The GCRO delegates effective implementation of the Risk Type Frameworks (RTFs) to Risk Framework Owners who provide second line of defence oversight for the Principal Risk Types (PRTs). In addition, the GCRO has been formally identified as the relevant senior manager responsible for the development of the Group's Digital Asset Risk Assessment Approach, as well as the senior manager responsible for Climate Risk management as it relates to financial and non-financial risks to the Group arising from climate change. This does not include elements of corporate social responsibility, the Group's contribution to climate change and the Sustainable Finance strategy supporting a low-carbon transition, which are the responsibility of other relevant senior managers.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Appetite and profile\n\nWe recognise the following constraints which determine the risks that we are willing to take in pursuit of our strategy and the development of a sustainable business:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk the Group can assume, before breaching constraints determined by capital and liquidity requirements and internal operational environment, or otherwise failing to meet the expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies.\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite is defined by the Group and approved by the Board. It is the maximum amount and type of risk the Group is willing to assume in pursuit of its strategy. Risk Appetite cannot exceed risk capacity.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Risk Appetite Statement, which is underpinned by a set of financial and operational control parameters known as Risk Appetite metrics and their associated thresholds. These directly constrain the aggregate risk exposures that can be taken across the Group.\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is reviewed at least on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and aligned with strategy, and focus is given to emerging or new risks. The Risk Appetite Statement is supplemented by an overarching statement outlining the Group's Risk Appetite principles.\n\n## Risk Appetite principles\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is defined in accordance with risk management principles that inform our overall approach to risk management and our risk culture. We follow the highest ethical standards and ensure a fair outcome for our clients, as well as facilitating the effective operation of financial markets, while at the same time meeting the expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies. We set our Risk Appetite to enable us to grow sustainably and to avoid shocks to earnings or our general financial health, as well as manage our Reputational Risk in a way that does not materially undermine the confidence of our investors and all internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group will not compromise adherence to its Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns. The Group Risk Appetite is supplemented by risk control tools such as granular level limits, policies, standards and other operational control parameters that are used to keep the Group's risk profile within Risk Appetite. The Group's risk profile is its overall exposure to risk at a given point in time, covering all applicable risk types. Status against Risk Appetite is reported to the Board, Board Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, including the status of breaches and remediation plans where applicable. To keep the Group's risk profile within Risk Appetite (and therefore also risk capacity), we have cascaded critical Group Risk Appetite metrics across our Principal Risk Types to our footprint markets with significant business operations.\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nIdentification and assessment of potentially adverse risk events is an essential first step in managing the risks of any business or activity. To ensure consistency in communication, we use Principal Risk Types to classify our risk exposures.\n\nNevertheless, we also recognise the need to maintain a holistic perspective since a single transaction or activity may give rise to multiple types of risk exposure; risk concentrations may arise from multiple exposures that are closely correlated; and a given risk exposure may change its form from one risk type to another. There are also sources of risk that arise beyond our own operations, such as the Group's dependency on suppliers for the provision of services and technology.\n\nAs the Group remains accountable for risks arising from the actions of such third-parties, failure to adequately monitor and manage these relationships could materially impact the Group's ability to operate and could have an impact on our ability to continue to provide services that are material to the Group.\n\nTo facilitate risk identification and assessment, the Group maintains a dynamic risk-scanning process with inputs on the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunities from the business and client perspectives. The Group maintains a taxonomy of the Principal Risk Types, Integrated Risk Types and risk sub-types that are inherent to the strategy and business model; as well as Topical and Emerging Risks (TERs) inventory that includes near-term as well as longer-term uncertainties. Near-term risks are those that are on the horizon and can be measured and mitigated to some extent, while uncertainties are longer-term matters that should be on the radar but are not yet fully measurable.\n\nThe GCRO and the Group Risk Committee review regular reports on the risk profile for the Principal Risk Types, adherence to the approved Risk Appetite and the Group risk inventory including emerging risks and uncertainties. They use this information to escalate material developments in each risk event and make recommendations to the Board annually on any potential changes to our Corporate Plan.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe objective of stress testing is to support the Group in assessing that it:\n\n- \u00b7 does not have a portfolio with excessive risk concentration that could produce unacceptably high losses under severe but plausible scenarios\n- \u00b7 has sufficient financial resources to withstand severe but plausible scenarios\n- \u00b7 has the financial flexibility to respond to extreme but plausible scenarios; and\n- \u00b7 understands the Group's key business model risks and considers what kind of event might crystallise those risks even if extreme with a low likelihood of occurring - and identifies as required, actions to mitigate the likelihood or impact of those events\n\nEnterprise stress tests incorporate Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Stress Tests, including in the context of capital adequacy, recovery and resolution, and stress tests that assess scenarios where our business model becomes challenged, such as the Bank of England (BoE) Biennial Exploratory Scenario, or unviable, such as reverse stress tests.\n\nStress tests are performed at the Group, country, business and portfolio level under a wide range of risks and at varying degrees of severity. Unless set by the BoE, scenario design is a bespoke process that aims to explore risks that can adversely impact the Group.",

These risks are managed through distinct RTFs which are approved by the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe Principal Risk Types and associated Risk Appetite Statements are approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group currently recognises Climate Risk, Digital Asset Risk and Third-Party Risk as Integrated Risk Types. Climate Risk is defined as 'the potential for financial loss and non-financial detriments arising from climate change and society's response to it'; Digital Asset Risk is defined as 'the potential for regulatory penalties, financial loss and or reputational damage to the Group resulting from digital asset exposure or digital asset related activities arising from the Group's Clients, Products and Projects' and Third-Party Risk is defined as 'the potential for loss or adverse impact from failure to manage multiple risks arising from the use of third parties, and is the aggregate of these risks.'\n\nIn future reviews, we will continue to consider if existing Principal Risk Types or incremental risks should be treated as Integrated Risk Types.

effectiveness reviews\n\nThe GCRO is responsible for annually affirming the effectiveness of the ERMF to the Board Risk Committee. An ERMF effectiveness review was established in 2018 to facilitate this affirmation, which follows the principle of evidence-based self-assessments for all the Risk Type Frameworks and relevant policies. A top-down review and challenge of the results is conducted by the GCRO with all Risk Framework Owners and an opinion on the internal control environment is provided by Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe ERMF effectiveness review is conducted annually and enables measurement of progress against the 2018 baseline. The key outcomes of the 2022 effectiveness review are:\n\n- \u00b7 The focus in 2022 continued on the effective embedding of the framework across the organisation.\n- \u00b7 While the more mature financial risks continued to be more effectively managed, the Group continues to make progress in embedding the non-financial risk management\n- \u00b7 Other aspects of the ERMF, including the key risk committees and key supporting standards, are established.\n\n- \u00b7 Self-assessments performed in our footprint markets reflect the embeddedness of ERMF adoption with an emphasis on first-line ownership of risks. Country and regional risk committees continue to play an active role in managing and overseeing material issues arising in countries.\n\nOngoing ERMF effectiveness reviews allow for a structured approach to identify improvement opportunities and build plans to address them. Over the course of 2023, the Group aims to further strengthen its risk management practices by further improving on the management of non-financial risks and integrated risks within its businesses, functions and across the footprint.\n\n## Executive and Board risk oversight\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Board has ultimate responsibility for risk management and is supported by five core Board-level committees. The Board approves the ERMF based on the recommendation from the Board Risk Committee, which also recommends the Group Risk Appetite Statement for all Principal Risk Types. In addition, the Culture and Sustainability Committee oversees the Group's culture and key sustainability priorities.",

The Credit Risk function is the second-line control function responsible for independent challenge, monitoring and oversight of the Credit Risk management practices of the business and functions engaged in or supporting revenuegenerating activities which constitute the first line of defence. In addition, they ensure that credit risks are properly assessed and transparent; and that credit decisions are controlled in accordance with the Group's Risk Appetite, credit policies and standards.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nSegment-specific policies are in place for the management of Credit Risk. The Credit Policy for CCIB Client Coverage sets the principles that must be followed for the end-to-end credit process, including credit initiation, credit grading, credit assessment, product structuring, Credit Risk mitigation, monitoring and control, and documentation.\n\nThe CPBB Credit Risk Management Policy sets the principles for the management of CPBB segments, that must be followed for end-to-end credit process including credit initiation, credit assessment and monitoring for lending to these segments.\n\nThe Group also sets out standards for the eligibility, enforceability and effectiveness of Credit Risk mitigation arrangements. Potential credit losses from a given account, client or portfolio are mitigated using a range of tools, such as collateral, netting agreements, credit insurance, credit derivatives and guarantees.\n\nRisk mitigants are also carefully assessed for their market value, legal enforceability, correlation and counterparty risk of the protection provider.\n\nCollateral must be valued prior to drawdown and regularly thereafter as required, to reflect current market conditions, the probability of recovery and the period of time to realise the collateral in the event of liquidation. The Group also seeks to diversify its collateral holdings across asset classes and markets.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group manages its credit exposures following the principle of diversification across products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors.\n\nWhere guarantees, credit insurance, standby letters of credit or credit derivatives are used as Credit Risk mitigation, the creditworthiness of the protection provider is assessed and monitored using the same credit approval process applied to the obligor.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Credit Risk among other risks within the bank. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees and appoints sub-committees for the management of all risk types including Credit Risk - in particular the Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Risk Committee, (CCIBRC), Consumer, Private and Business Banking Risk Committee (CPBBRC), and the regional risk committees for Asia, and Africa & Middle East. The GRC also receives reports from other key Group Committees such as the Standard Chartered Bank Executive Risk Committee (which cover Credit risk as well).\n\nThese committees are responsible for overseeing all Risk profiles including Credit Risk of the Group within the respective business areas and regions. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Credit Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, and ensure that appropriate action is taken.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Credit Risk Type Frameworks are the formal mechanism by which delegate Credit Risk authorities cascading from the GCRO, as the Senior Manager of the Credit Risk Type, to individuals such as the business segments' Chief Risk Officers. Named individuals further delegate credit authorities to individual credit officers based on risk-adjusted scales by customer type or portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk authorities are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate. In CCIB Client Coverage, the individuals delegating the Credit Risk authorities perform oversight by reviewing a sample of the limit applications approved by the delegated credit officers on a monthly basis. In CPBB, where credit decision systems and tools (e.g. application scorecards) are used for credit decisioning, such risk models are subject to performance monitoring and periodic validation. Where manual or discretionary credit decisions are applied, periodic quality control assessments and assurance checks are performed by the individuals delegating the Credit Risk authorities.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring\n\nWe regularly monitor credit exposures, portfolio performance, external trends and emerging risks that may impact risk management outcomes. Internal risk management reports that are presented to risk committees contain information on key political and economic trends across major portfolios and countries, portfolio delinquency and loan impairment performance.\n\nThe Industry Portfolio Mandate, developed jointly by the CCIB Client Coverage business and the Risk function, provides a forward-looking assessment of risk using a platform from which business strategy, risk considerations and client planning are performed with one consensus view of the external industry outlook, portfolio overviews, Risk Appetite, underwriting principles and stress test insights.\n\nIn CCIB Client Coverage, clients and portfolios are subjected to additional review when they display signs of actual or potential weakness; for example, where there is a decline in the client's position within the industry, financial deterioration, a breach of covenants, or non-performance of an obligation within the stipulated period. Such accounts are subjected to a dedicated process overseen by the Credit Issues Committees in the relevant countries where client account strategies and credit grades are re-evaluated. In addition, remedial actions, including placing accounts on early alert for increased scrutiny, exposure reduction, security enhancement or exiting the account could be undertaken. Certain accounts could also be transferred into the control management of the Stressed Assets Group (SAG), which is our specialist recovery unit for CCIB Client Coverage that operates independently from our main business.\n\nAny material in-country developments that may impact the sovereign ratings are monitored closely by the Country Risk Team. A Country Risk Early Warning system, a triage-based risk identification system was developed to categorise countries based on forward looking view of possible downgrade and expected incremental RWA impact of potential downgrade.\n\nFor CPBB, exposures and collateral monitoring are performed at the counterparty and/or portfolio level across different client segments to ensure transactions and portfolio exposures remain within Risk Appetite. Portfolio delinquency trends are monitored on an ongoing basis. Accounts that are past due (or perceived as high risk but not yet past due) are subject to a collections or recovery process managed by a specialist function independent from the origination function. In some countries, aspects of collections and recovery activities are outsourced. For discretionary lending portfolios, similar processes as those of Commercial client coverage are followed.\n\nIn addition, an independent Credit Risk Review team (part of Enterprise Risk Management), performs judgement-based assessments of the Credit Risk profiles at various portfolio levels, with focus on selected countries and segments through deep dives, comparative analysis, and review and challenge of the basis of credit approvals. The review ensures that the evolving Credit Risk profiles of CCIB and CPBB are well managed within our Risk Appetite and policies through prompt and forward-looking mitigating actions.\n\n## Credit rating and measurement\n\nAll credit proposals are subject to a robust Credit Risk assessment. It includes a comprehensive evaluation of the client's credit quality, including willingness, ability and capacity to repay. The primary lending consideration is based on the client's credit quality and the repayment capacity from operating cashflows for counterparties, and personal income or wealth for individual borrowers. The risk assessment gives due consideration to the client's liquidity and leverage position. Where applicable, the assessment includes a detailed analysis of the Credit Risk mitigation arrangements to determine the level of reliance on such arrangements as the secondary source of repayment in the event of a significant deterioration in a client's credit quality leading to default. For Wealth Lending, Collateral is considered primary source of repayment hereby loan agreement envisages that the repayment of loan is based on sale of collateral provided.\n\nRisk measurement plays a central role, along with judgement and experience, in informing risk-taking and portfolio management decisions. We adopt the advanced internal ratings-based approach under the Basel regulatory framework to calculate Credit Risk capital requirements. The Group has also established a global programme to undertake a comprehensive assessment of capital requirements necessary to be implemented to meet the latest revised Basel III finalisation (Basel IV) regulations.\n\nA standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system is used for CCIB Client Coverage. The numeric grades run from 1 to 14 and some of the grades are further sub-classified. Lower numeric credit grades are indicative of a lower likelihood of default. Credit grades 1 to 12 are assigned to performing customers, while credit grades 13 and 14 are assigned to non-performing or defaulted customers.\n\nCPBB internal ratings-based portfolios use application and behavioural credit scores that are calibrated to generate a probability of default. Risk Decision Framework as a credit rating system supports the delivery of optimum risk-adjustedreturns with controlled volatility and is used to define the portfolio/new booking segmentation, shape and decision criteria for the unsecured consumer business segment.\n\nAdvanced internal ratings-based models cover a substantial majority of our exposures and are used in assessing risks at a customer and portfolio level, setting strategy and optimising our risk-return decisions. Material internal ratings-based risk measurement models are approved by the Model Risk Committee. Prior to review and approval, all internal ratingsbased models are validated in detail by a model validation team, which is separate from the teams that develop and maintain the models. Models undergo annual validation by an independent model validation team. Reviews are also triggered if the performance of a model deteriorates materially against predetermined thresholds during the ongoing model performance monitoring process which takes place between the annual validations.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Concentration Risk\n\nCredit Concentration Risk may arise from a single large exposure to a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties, or from multiple exposures across the portfolio that are closely correlated. Large exposure Concentration Risk is managed through concentration limits set for a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties based on control and economic dependence criteria. Risk Appetite metrics are set at portfolio level and monitored to control concentrations, where appropriate, by industry, specific products, tenor, collateralisation level, top clients and exposure to holding companies. Single name credit concentration thresholds are set by client group depending on credit grade, and by customer segment. For concentrations that are material at a Group level, breaches and potential breaches are monitored by the respective governance committees and reported to the Group Risk Committee and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Credit impairment\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are determined for all financial assets that are classified as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. ECL is computed as an unbiased, probability-weighted provision determined by evaluating a range of plausible outcomes, the time value of money, and forward-looking information such as critical global or country-specific macroeconomic variables. For more detailed information on macroeconomic data feeding into IFRS 9 ECL calculations, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 269 to 281).\n\nAt the time of origination or purchase of a non-creditimpaired financial asset (stage 1), ECL represent cash shortfalls arising from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. ECL continue to be determined on this basis until there is a significant increase in the Credit Risk of the asset (stage 2), in which case an ECL is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifetime of the asset. If there is observed objective evidence of credit impairment or default (stage 3), ECL continue to be measured on a lifetime basis. To provide the Board with oversight and assurance that the quality of assets originated are aligned to the Group's strategy, there is a Risk Appetite metric to monitor the stage 1 and stage 2 expected credit losses from assets originated in the past 12 months.\n\nIn CCIB Client Coverage, a loan is considered credit-impaired where analysis and review indicate that full payment of either interest or principal, including the timeliness of such payment, is questionable, or as soon as payment of interest or principal is 90 days overdue. These credit-impaired accounts are managed by our specialist recovery unit, SAG.\n\nIn CPBB, a loan to individuals and small businesses is considered credit-impaired as soon as payment of interest or principal is 90 days overdue or meets other objective evidence of impairment such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death. Financial assets are written-off when it meets certain threshold conditions which are set at the point where empirical evidence suggests that the client is unlikely to meet their contractual obligations, or a loss of principal is expected.\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of future recoveries involves significant judgement and considers the assessment of matters such as future economic conditions and the value of collateral, for which there may not be a readily accessible market. The total amount of the Group's impairment provision is inherently uncertain, being sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions across the regions in which the Group operates. For further details on sensitivity analysis of expected credit losses under IFRS 9, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 269 to 281).\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is a forward-looking risk management tool that constitutes a key input into the identification, monitoring and mitigation of Credit Risk, as well as contributing to Risk Appetite calibration. Periodic stress tests are performed on credit portfolios/segments to anticipate vulnerabilities from stressed conditions and initiate timely right-sizing and mitigation plans. Additionally, multiple enterprise-wide and country-level stress tests are mandated by regulators to assess the ability of the Group and its subsidiaries to continue to meet their capital requirements during a plausible, adverse shock to the business. These regulatory stress tests are conducted in line with the principles stated in the Enterprise Stress Testing Policy. Stress tests for key portfolios are reviewed by the Credit Risk Type Framework Owners (or delegates) as part of portfolio oversight; and matters considered material to the Group are escalated to the GCRO and respective regional risk committee.",

The business, acting as first line of defence, is responsible for the effective management of risks within the scope of its direct organisational responsibilities set by the Board.\n\nTRM is the core second-line control function that performs independent challenge, monitoring and oversight of the Traded Risk management practices of the first line of defence, predominantly Financial Markets and Treasury Markets. The first and second lines of defence are supported by the organisation structure, job descriptions and authorities delegated by Traded Risk control owners.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe TRTF requires that Traded Risk limits are defined at a level appropriate to ensure that the Group remains within Risk Appetite. All businesses incurring Traded Risk must comply with the TRTF. The Traded Risk Policy sets the principles that must be followed for the end-to-end traded risk management process including limit setting, risk capture and measurement, limit monitoring and escalation, risk mitigation and stress testing. Policies and standards ensure that these Traded Risk limits are implemented. Policies are reviewed and approved by the Global Head, TRM at least once every two years to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Traded Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee delegates responsibilities to the CCIBRC to oversee the Traded Risk profile of the Group. For subsidiaries, the authority for setting Traded Risk limits is delegated from the local board to the local risk committee, Country Chief Risk Officer and Traded Risk managers. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Traded Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, and ensure that appropriate action is taken.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe TRTF is the formal mechanism which delegates Traded Risk authorities cascading from the GCRO, as the Senior Manager of the Traded Risk Type, to the Global Head, TRM who further delegates authorities to named individuals.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should control its financial markets activities to ensure that Traded Risk losses do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\nTraded Risk authorities are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and to assess the quality of decisions taken by the authorised person. Key risk-taking decisions are made only by certain individuals with the skills, judgement and perspective to ensure that the Group's control standards and risk-return objectives are met.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nThe Group uses a Value at Risk (VaR) model to measure the risk of losses arising from future potential adverse movements in market rates, prices and volatilities. VaR is a quantitative measure of Market Risk that applies recent historical market conditions to estimate the potential future loss in market value that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a set statistical confidence level. VaR provides a consistent measure that can be applied across trading businesses and products over time and can be set against actual daily trading profit and loss outcomes.\n\nFor day-to-day risk management, VaR is calculated as at the close of business, generally at UK time for expected market movements over one business day and to a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. Intra-day risk levels may vary from those reported at the end of the day.\n\nThe Group applies two VaR methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 Historical simulation: this involves the revaluation of all existing positions to reflect the effect of historically observed changes in Market Risk factors on the valuation of the current portfolio. This approach is applied for general Market Risk factors and the majority of specific (credit spread) risk VaRs.\n- \u00b7 Monte Carlo simulation: this methodology is similar to historical simulation but with considerably more input risk factor observations. These are generated by random sampling techniques, but the results retain the essential variability and correlations of historically observed risk factor changes. This approach is applied for some of the specific (credit spread) risk VaRs in relation to idiosyncratic exposures in credit markets.\n\nA one-year historical observation period is applied in both methods.\n\nAs an input to regulatory capital, trading book VaR is calculated for expected movements over 10 business days and to a confidence level of 99 per cent. Some types of Market Risk are not captured in the regulatory VaR measure, and these Risks not in VaR are subject to capital add-ons.\n\nAn analysis of VaR results in 2022 is available in the Risk profile section (pages 282 to 285).",

        "page_content": "## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nThe Group uses a Potential Future Exposure (PFE) model to measure the credit exposure arising from the positive mark-tomarket of traded products and future potential movements in market rates, prices and volatilities. PFE is a quantitative measure of Counterparty Credit Risk that applies recent historical market conditions to estimate the potential future credit exposure that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. PFE is calculated for expected market movements over different time horizons based on the tenor of the transactions.\n\nThe Group applies two PFE methodologies: simulation based, which is predominantly used, and an add-on based PFE methodology.\n\n## Underwriting\n\nThe underwriting of securities and loans is in scope of the Risk Appetite set by the Group for Traded Risk. Additional limits approved by the GCRO are set on the sectoral concentration, and the maximum holding period. The Underwriting Committee, under the authority of the GCRO, approves individual proposals to underwrite new security issues and loans for our clients.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTRM monitors the overall portfolio risk and ensures that it is within specified limits and therefore Risk Appetite. Limits are typically reviewed twice a year. Most of the Traded Risk exposures are monitored daily against approved limits. Traded Risk limits apply at all times unless separate intra-day limits have been set. Limit excess approval decisions are based on an assessment of the circumstances driving the excess and of the proposed remediation plan. Limits and excesses can only be approved by a Traded Risk manager with the appropriate delegated authority.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe VaR and PFE measurements are complemented by stress testing of Market Risk and Counterparty Credit Risk to highlight the potential risk that may arise from severe but plausible market events.\n\nStress testing is an integral part of the Traded Risk management framework and considers both historical market events and forward-looking scenarios. A consistent stress testing methodology is applied to trading and nontrading books. The stress testing methodology assumes that management action would be limited during a stress event, reflecting the expected decrease in market liquidity. Stress test scenarios are applied to interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Stress scenarios are reviewed and updated where necessary to reflect changes in risk profile and economic events.\n\nTRM reviews the stress testing results and, where necessary, enforces reductions in overall Traded Risk exposures. The Group Risk Committee considers the results of stress tests as part of its supervision of Risk Appetite. Group and businesswide stress testing are supplemented by legal entity stress testing, subject to the relevant local governance.",

Regional Treasury Chief Risk Officers and Country Chief Risk Officers for Treasury Risk (except Pension Risk) and Head of Pensions (for Pension Risk) are responsible for overseeing and challenging the first line of defence.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group develops policies to address material Treasury Risks and aims to maintain its risk profile within Risk Appetite. In order to do this, metrics are set against Capital Risk, Liquidity and Funding Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). Where appropriate, Risk Appetite metrics are cascaded down to regions and countries in the form of Limits and Management Action Triggers.\n\n## Capital Risk\n\nIn order to manage Capital Risk, strategic business and capital plans (Corporate Plan) are drawn up covering a five-year horizon which are approved by the Board annually. The plan ensures that adequate levels of capital, including lossabsorbing capacity, and an efficient mix of the different components of capital are maintained to support our strategy and business plans.\n\nTreasury is responsible for the ongoing assessment of the demand for capital and the updating of the Group's capital plan.\n\nRisk Appetite metrics including capital, leverage, minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liability (MREL) and double leverage are assessed within the Corporate Plan to ensure that the strategy can be achieved within risk tolerances.\n\n## Structural FX Risk\n\nThe Group's structural position results from the Group's non-US dollar investment in the share capital and reserves of subsidiaries and branches. The FX translation gains, or losses are recorded in the Group's translation reserves with a direct impact on the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should maintain sufficient capital, liquidity and funding to support its operations, and an interest rate profile ensuring that the reductions in earnings or value from movements in interest rates impacting banking book items does not cause material damage to the Group's franchise. In addition, the Group should ensure its Pension plans are adequately funded.\n\nThe Group contracts hedges to manage its structural FX position in accordance with the Board-approved Risk Appetite, and as a result the Group has taken net investment hedges to partially cover its exposure to certain non-US dollar currencies to mitigate the FX impact of such positions on its capital ratios.\n\n## Liquidity and Funding Risk\n\nAt Group, regional and country level we implement various business-as-usual and stress risk metrics and monitor these against Limits and Management Action Triggers. In addition to these, where relevant, Monitoring Metrics are also set against specific risks. This ensures that the Group maintains an adequate and well-diversified liquidity buffer, as well as a stable funding base, and that it meets its liquidity and funding regulatory requirements. The approach to managing risks and the Board Risk Appetite are assessed annually through the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process. A funding plan is also developed for efficient liquidity projections to ensure that the Group is adequately funded in the required currencies, to meet its obligations and client funding needs. The funding plan is part of the overall Corporate Plan process aligning to the capital requirements.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThis risk arises from differences in the repricing profile, interest rate basis, and optionality of banking book assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. IRRBB represents an economic and commercial risk to the Group and its capital adequacy. The Group monitors IRRBB against the Board Risk Appetite.\n\n## Pension Risk\n\nPension Risk is the potential for loss due to having to meet an actuarially assessed shortfall in the Group's pension plans. Pension obligation risk to a firm arises from its contractual or other liabilities to or with respect to an occupational pension plan or other long term benefit obligation. For a funded plan it represents the risk that additional contributions will need to be made because of a future shortfall in the funding of the plan or, for unfunded obligations, it represents the risk that the cost of meeting future benefit payments is greater than currently anticipated. Pension Risk position against defined Risk Appetite metrics is reported to the Group Risk Committee. These metrics include the current IAS 19 deficit, and the total capital requirement (including both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A capital) in respect of Pension Risk, both expressed as a number of basis points of RWA.",

The Recovery Plan includes a set of recovery indicators, an escalation framework and a set of management actions capable of being implemented in a stress. A Recovery Plan is also maintained within each major entity, and all recovery plans are subject to periodic firedrill testing.\n\nAs the UK resolution authority, the BoE is required to set a preferred resolution strategy for the Group.

At the executive level, the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) ensures the effective management of risk throughout the Group in support of the Group's strategy, guides the Group's strategy on balance sheet optimisation and ensures that the Group operates within the internally approved Risk Appetite and other internal and external requirements relating to Treasury Risk (except Pension Risk) The Group Risk Committee and Regional Risk Committees provide oversight for Pension Risk.\n\nRegional and country oversight resides with regional and country Asset and Liability Committees. Regions and countries must ensure that they remain in compliance with Group Treasury policies and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer has responsibility for capital, funding and liquidity under the Senior Managers Regime. The GCRO has delegated the Risk Framework Owner responsibilities associated with Treasury Risk to the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management. The Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates second-line oversight and challenge responsibilities to the Treasury Chief Risk Officer and Country Chief Risk Officers for Capital Risk, Liquidity and Funding Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book and to Head of Pensions for Pension Risk.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, Treasury Risk is managed by Treasury, Finance and Country Chief Executive Officers. The Group regularly reports and monitors Treasury Risk inherent in its business activities and those that arise from internal and external events.\n\nInternal risk management reports covering the balance sheet and the capital and liquidity position are presented to the relevant country Asset and Liability Committee. The reports contain key information on balance sheet trends, exposures against Risk Appetite and supporting risk measures which enable members to make informed decisions around the overall management of the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, an independent Treasury Chief Risk Officer as part of Enterprise Risk Management reviews the prudency and effectiveness of Treasury Risk management.\n\nPension Risk is actively managed by the Head of Pensions and monitored by the Head of Country Risk, Scenario Analysis, Insurable and Pension Risk. The Head of Pensions ensures that accurate, complete and timely updates on Pension Risk are shared with the Head of Country Risk, Scenario Analysis and Pension Risk; Treasury CRO and the Global Head, ERM on a periodic basis.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are an integral part of the Treasury Risk Framework and are used to ensure that the Group's internal assessment of capital and liquidity considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on its risk profile. A number of stress scenarios, some designed internally, some required by regulators, are run periodically.\n\nThey provide an insight into the potential impact of significant adverse events on the Group's capital and liquidity position and how this could be mitigated through appropriate management actions to ensure that the Group remains within the approved Risk Appetite and regulatory limits.\n\nDaily liquidity stress scenarios are also run to ensure that the Group holds sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand extreme liquidity events.",

        "page_content": "## Operational and Technology Risk\n\nThe Group defines Operational and Technology Risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, technology events, human error or from the impact of external events (including legal risks).\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework (O&T RTF) sets the roles and responsibilities in respect of Operational Risk for the Group, and is owned by the Global Head of Risk, Functions and Operational Risk (GHRFOR). This framework collectively defines the Group's Operational Risk sub-types which have not been classified as PRTs and sets standards for the identification, control, monitoring and treatment of risks. These standards are applicable across all PRTs and risk sub-types in the O&T RTF. These risk sub-types relate to execution capability, governance, reporting and obligations, legal enforceability, and operational resilience (including client service, change management, people management, safety and security, and technology risk).\n\nThe O&T RTF reinforces clear accountability for managing risk throughout the Group and delegates second line of defence responsibilities to identified subject matter experts. For each risk sub-type, the expert sets policies and standards for the organisation to comply with, and provides guidance, oversight and challenge over the activities of the Group. They ensure that key risk decisions are only taken by individuals with the requisite skills, judgement, and perspective to ensure that the Group's risk-return objectives are met.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe O&T RTF sets out the Group's overall approach to the management of Operational Risk in line with the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite. This is supported by Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) which defines roles and responsibilities for the identification, control and monitoring of risks (applicable to all PRTs, risk sub-types and integrated risks).\n\nThe RCSA is used to determine the design strength and reliability of each process, and requires:\n\n- \u00b7 the recording of processes run by client segments, products and functions into a process universe\n- \u00b7 the identification of potential breakdowns to these processes and the related risks of such breakdowns\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the impact of the identified risks based on a consistent scale\n- \u00b7 the design and monitoring of controls to mitigate prioritised risks\n- \u00b7 assessments of residual risk and timely actions for elevated risks.\n\nRisks that exceed the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite require treatment plans to address underlying causes.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Operational Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee is responsible\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to control operational and technology risks to ensure that operational losses (financial or reputational), including any related to conduct of business matters, do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\nfor the governance and oversight of Operational Risk for the Group, monitors the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite and relies on other key Group committees for the management of Operational Risk, in particular the Group Non-Financial Risk Committee (GNFRC).\n\nRegional business segments and functional committees also provide enterprise oversight of their respective processes and related operational risks. In addition, Country Non-Financial Risk Committees (CNFRCs) oversee the management of Operational Risk at the country (or entity) level. In smaller countries, the responsibilities of the CNFRC may be exercised directly by the Country Risk Committee (for branches) or Executive Risk Committee (for subsidiaries).\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe O&T RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Operational Risk authorities is made. The GHRFOR places reliance on the respective Senior Managers who are outside the Risk function for second-line oversight of the risk sub-types through this framework. The Senior Managers may further delegate their second-line responsibilities to designated individuals at a global business, product and function level, as well as regional or country level.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTo deliver services to clients and to participate in the financial services sector, the Group runs processes which are exposed to operational risks. The Group prioritises and manages risks which are significant to clients and to the financial services sectors. Control indicators are regularly monitored to determine the residual risk the Group is exposed to.\n\nThe residual risk assessments and reporting of events form the Group's Operational Risk profile. The completeness of the Operational Risk profile ensures appropriate prioritisation and timeliness of risk decisions, including risk acceptances with treatment plans for risks that exceed acceptable thresholds.\n\nThe Board is informed on adherence to Operational and Technology Risk Appetite through metrics reported for selected risks. These metrics are monitored, and escalation thresholds are devised based on the materiality and significance of the risk. These Operational and Technology Risk Appetite metrics are consolidated on a regular basis and reported at relevant Group committees. This provides senior management with the relevant information to inform their risk decisions.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for operational risks. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the Group's Operational Risk profile. A number of scenarios have been identified to test the robustness of the Group's processes and assess the potential impact on the Group. These scenarios include anti-money laundering and sanctions, as well as information and cyber security.",

It emphasises business ownership and individual accountability.\n\nThe Group Chief Transformation, Technology & Operations Officer (CTTO) has overall first line of defence responsibility for ICS Risk and is accountable for the Group's ICS strategy. The Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads the development and execution of the ICS strategy. The first line also manages all key ICS Risks, breaches and risk treatment plans with oversight from Group Chief Information Security Risk Officer (CISRO). ICS Risk profile, Risk Appetite breaches and remediation status are reported at Board and Executive committees, alongside Business, Function and Country governance committees.\n\nThe Group CISRO function within Group Risk, led by the Group CISRO, is the second line of defence and sets the framework, policy, standards and methodology for assessing, scoring and prioritising ICS Risks across the Group. This function has overall responsibility for governance, oversight and independent challenge of first line's pursuit of the ICS strategy. Group ICS Risk Framework Strategy remains the responsibility of the ICS Risk Framework Owner (RFO), delegated from the Group CRO to the Group CISRO.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nICS Risk is managed through the structured ICS Risk Type Framework, comprising a risk assessment methodology and supporting policy, standards and methodologies. These are aligned to industry recommended practice. We undertake an annual ICS Effectiveness Review to evaluate ICS Risk management practices in alignment with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\nIn 2022, we uplifted the ICS RTF to include an updated ICS end-to-end Risk Management and Governance approach and continued the roll out of the threat-led scenario risk assessment across the Group. The Group CISRO function monitors compliance to the ICS RTF by reviewing Group CISO's risk assessments and conducting independent assurance reviews.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nThe Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of ICS Risk. The Group Risk Committee (GRC) has delegated authority to the Group Non-Financial Risk Committee (GNFRC) to ensure effective implementation of the ICS RTF. The GRC and GNFRC are responsible for oversight of ICS Risk posture and Risk Appetite breaches rated very high and high. Sub-committees of the GNFRC have oversight of ICS Risk management arising from the Businesses, Countries and Functions.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has zero appetite for very high ICS residual risks and low appetite for High ICS residual risks which result in loss of services, data or funds. The Group will implement an effective ICS control environment and proactively identify and respond to emerging ICS threats in order to limit ICS incidents impacting the Group's franchise.\n\nMeanwhile the Cyber Security Advisory Forum (CSAF), chaired by the Group Chief Executive Officer, enables the Management Team, Group Chairman and non-executive directors to engage further on ICS, asking any questions freely at this non-governance forum.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe ICS RTF defines how the Group manages ICS Risk. The Group CISRO delegates authority to designated individuals through the ICS RTF, including second-line ownership at a Business, Function, Region and Country level.\n\nThe Group CISO is responsible for implementing ICS Risk Management within the Group, leveraging Group Process Owners and Business CISOs. These stakeholders cascade ICS risk management into the Businesses, Functions and Countries to comply with the ICS RTF, policy and standards.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGroup CISO perform a threat-led risk assessment to identify key threats, in-scope applications and key controls required to ensure the Group remains within Risk Appetite.\n\nThe ICS Risk postures of all businesses, functions and countries are consolidated to present a holistic Group-level ICS Risk posture for ongoing monitoring.\n\nDuring these reviews, the status of each risk is assessed against the Group's controls to identify any changes to impact and likelihood, which affects the overall risk rating.\n\nGroup CISO and Group CISRO monitor the ICS Risk profile and ensure that breaches of Risk Appetite are escalated to the appropriate governance committee or authority levels for adequate remediation and tracking. A dedicated Group CISRO team is supporting this work by executing offensive security testing exercises, which shows wider picture of risk security posture what leads to better visibility on potential risks 'in flight'.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for ICS Risk. Specific scenarios are developed annually in collaboration between first- and second-line ICS teams, incorporating extreme but plausible ICS Risk events.",

The Compliance RTF sets out the Group's overall approach to the management of Compliance Risk and the associated roles and responsibilities. All activities that the Group engages in must be designed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. The CFCC function provides second line oversight and challenge of the first-line risk management activities that relate to Compliance Risk.\n\nWhere Compliance Risk arises, or could arise, from failure to manage another Principal Risk Type or sub-type, the Compliance RTF outlines that the responsibility rests with the respective Risk Framework Owner or control function to ensure that effective oversight and challenge of the first line can be provided by the appropriate second-line function.\n\nEach of the assigned second-line functions has responsibilities including monitoring relevant regulatory developments from Non-Financial Services regulators at both Group and country levels, policy development, implementation, and validation as well as oversight and challenge of first-line processes and controls. In addition, the role of CFCC has been further clarified in 2022 in relation to Compliance risk and the boundary of responsibilities with other Principal Risk Types.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe CFCC function develops and deploys relevant policies and standards setting out requirements and controls for adherence by the Group to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Through a combination of standard setting, risk assessment, control monitoring and assurance activities, the Compliance Risk Framework Owner seeks to ensure that all policies are operating as expected to mitigate the risk that they cover. The installation of appropriate processes and controls is the primary tool for the mitigation of Compliance Risk. In this, the requirements of the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework are followed to ensure a consistent approach to the management of processes and controls. Deployment of technological solutions to improve efficiencies and simplify processes has continued in 2022. These include launch of a new platform to manage conflict\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to regulatory noncompliance; recognising that whilst incidents are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided.\n\nreview for Outside Business Activity, Personal Account Dealing, Close Financial Relationship and Deals / Reportable Events, and alongside digital chatbots, Advisor Connect to connect with an Advisor for complex queries.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt a management level, Compliance Risk and the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations resulting from failed processes and controls are overseen by the respective Country, Business, Product and Function Non-Financial Risk Committees including the Risk and CFCC Non-Financial Risk Committee for CFCC owned processes. Relevant matters, as required, are further escalated to the Group Non-Financial Risk Committee and Group Risk Committee. At Board level, oversight of Compliance Risk is primarily provided by the Audit Committee, and also by the Board Risk Committee for relevant issues.\n\nWhile not a formal committee, the CFCC Oversight Group provides oversight of CFCC risks including the effective implementation of the Compliance RTF. The Compliance Risk Framework Owner established a Regulatory Change Oversight Forum to have visibility and oversight of material and/or complex large-scale regulatory change emanating from Financial services regulators impacting Non-Financial Risks. A CFCC Policy Council has also been established to provide oversight, challenge and direction to Compliance and FCC Policy Owners on material changes and positions taken in CFCC-owned policies, including issues relating to regulatory interpretation and Group's CFCC risk appetite.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Compliance Risk Type Framework is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Compliance Risk authorities is made. The Group Head, CFCC has the authority to delegate second-line responsibilities within the CFCC function to relevant and suitably qualified individuals.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe monitoring of controls designed to mitigate the risk of regulatory non-compliance in processes is governed in line with the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework. The Group has a monitoring and reporting process in place for Compliance Risk, which includes escalation and reporting to Risk and CFCC Non-Financial Risk Committee, Group Non-Financial Risk Committee, Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and Audit Committee, as appropriate.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for Compliance Risk and form part of the overall scenario analysis portfolio managed under the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework. Specific scenarios are developed annually with collaboration between the business, which owns and manages the risk, and the CFCC function, which is second line to incorporate significant Compliance Risk tail events.

The Financial Crime Risk assessment is a Group-wide risk assessment undertaken annually to assess the inherent Financial Crime Risk exposures and the associated processes and controls by which these exposures are mitigated.\n- \u00b7 Financial Crime Surveillance - risk-based systems and processes to prevent and detect financial crime.\n\nThe strength of controls is tested and assessed through the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework, in addition to oversight by CFCC Assurance.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nFinancial Crime Risk within the Group is governed by the Group Financial Crime Risk Committee (GFCRC) and the Group Non-Financial Risk Committee (GNFRC) for Fraud Risk which is appointed by and reports into the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to financial crime, recognising that while incidents are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided.\n\nThroughout the Group, the GFCRC is responsible for ensuring effective oversight for Operational Risk relating to Financial Crime Risk, while the GNFRC is responsible for ensuring effective oversight of Operational Risk relating to NonFinancial Risks including Fraud Risk. Given the progress made on the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee's (BFCRC) purpose with respect to financial crime risk management, the Board reallocated the work of the BFCRC to the Audit Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board with effect from 1 April 2022. The reallocation of BFCRC oversight enables a more holistic and efficient examination and discussion of risks that are closely linked.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Financial Crime Risk Type Framework is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Financial Crime Risk authorities is made. The Group Head, CFCC is the Risk Framework Owner for Financial Crime Risk under the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework.

Responsibility for the oversight and implementation of the Model Risk Type Framework is delegated to the Global Head, Model Risk Management.\n\nThe Model Risk Type Framework sets out clear accountability and roles for Model Risk management through a Three Lines of Defence model. First-line ownership of Model Risk resides with Model Sponsors, who are business or function heads and assign a Model Owner for each model and provide oversight of Model Owner activities. Model Owners are the accountable executive for the model development process, represent model users, and are responsible for the overall model design process including engagement with Model Users to solicit feedback on the proposed model solution. Model Owners also coordinate the submission of models for validation and approval and ensure appropriate model implementation and use. Model Developers are responsible for the development of models, acting as a delegate of the Model Owner, and are responsible for documenting and testing the model in accordance with Policy requirements, and for engaging with Model Users as part of the development process. Second-line oversight is provided by Model Risk Management, which comprises Group Model Validation (GMV) and Model Risk Policy and Governance.\n\nThe Group adopts an industry standard model definition as specified in the Group Model Risk Policy, together with a scope of applicability represented by defined model family types as detailed within the Model Risk Type Framework. Model Owners are accountable for ensuring that all models under their purview have been independently validated by GMV. Models must be validated before use and then on an ongoing basis, with schedule determined by the perceived level of model risk associated with the model, or more frequently if there are specific regulatory requirements.\n\nGMV independently reviews and grades models, in line with design objectives, business uses and compliance requirements, and highlights identified model risks by raising model related issues. The Model Risk Policy and Governance team provides oversight of Model Risk activities, performing regular Model Risk Assessment and risk profile reporting to senior management.\n\nFor countries or legal entities that are in scope of the Model Risk Type Framework, the Group Model Risk Policy specifies the Country Model Risk Framework Owner, delegated to the Country Chief Risk Officer, as accountable for ensuring model usage is correctly identified within the country or legal entity and a suitable local governance process is established to accommodate models requiring local regulatory approval\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for material adverse implications arising from misuse of models or errors in the development or implementation of models; whilst accepting model uncertainty.\n\nand for any other specific local regulatory requirements at the country or legal entity level. GMV will take into consideration any country or legal entity specific considerations when validating a model, the model would be endorsed at Group level and then approved for use in the country or legal entity via the local governance process.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Model Risk policy and standards define requirements for model development and validation activities, including regular model performance monitoring. Any model issues or deficiencies identified through the validation process are mitigated through the application of model monitoring, model overlays and/or a model redevelopment plan, which undergo robust review, challenge and approval. Operational controls govern all Model Risk-related processes, with regular risk assessments performed to assess appropriateness and effectiveness of those controls, in line with the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework, with remediation plans implemented where necessary.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee exercises oversight of Model Risk within the Group. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee has appointed the Model Risk Committee to ensure effective measurement and management of Model Risk. Sub-committees such as the Credit Model Assessment Committee, Traded Risk Model Assessment Committee and Financial Crime Compliance Model Assessment Committee oversee their respective in-scope models and escalate material Model Risks to the Model Risk Committee. In parallel, business and function-level risk committees provide governance oversight of the models used in their respective processes.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Model Risk Type Framework is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Model Risk authorities is made.\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates authorities to designated individuals or Policy Owners through the RTF.

Furthermore, the Environmental and Social Risk Management team (ESRM) provides dedicated advisory and challenge to businesses on the management of environmental and social risks and impacts arising from the Group's client relationships and transactions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn line with the principles of Responsible Business Conduct and Do No Significant Harm, the Group deems Reputational and Sustainability Risk to be driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions, including shifts as a result of greenwashing claims, due to decisions related to clients, products, transactions, third parties and strategic coverage\n- \u00b7 potential material harm or degradation to the natural environment (environmental) through actions/inactions of the Group\n- \u00b7 potential material harm to individuals or communities (social) risks through actions/inactions of the Group.\n\nThe Group's Reputational Risk policy sets out the principal sources of Reputational Risk driven by negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions as well as responsibilities, control and oversight standards for identifying, assessing, escalating and effectively managing Reputational Risk. The Group takes a structured approach to the assessment of risks associated with how individual client, transaction, product and strategic coverage decisions may affect perceptions of the organisation and its activities, based on explicit principles including, but not limited to human rights, gambling, defence and dual use goods. Whenever potential for stakeholder concerns is identified, issues are subject to prior approval by a management authority commensurate with the materiality of matters being considered. Such authorities may accept or decline the risk or impose conditions upon proposals, to protect the Group's reputation. In 2022, the Reputational Risk Policy was enhanced to include more rigorous assessment of clients operating in sectors which have heightened climate risk.\n\nThe Group's Sustainability Risk policy sets out the requirements and responsibilities for managing environmental and social risks for the Group's clients, third parties and in our own operations, as guided by various industry standards such as the OECD's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, Equator Principles, UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Clients are expected to adhere to minimum regulatory and compliance requirements, including criteria from the Group's Position Statements. In 2022, the Sustainability Risk Policy was enhanced to include the monitoring of inherent risks related to Sustainable Finance products and transactions and clients throughout their lifecycle - from labelling to disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Third parties such as suppliers must comply with the Group's Supplier Charter which sets out the Group's expectations on ethics, anti-bribery and corruption, human rights, environmental, health and safety standards, labour and protection of the environment.\n- \u00b7 Within our operations, the Group seeks to minimise its impact on the environment and have targets to reduce energy, water and waste.\n\nReputational and Sustainability Risk policies and standards are applicable to all Group entities. However, local regulators in some markets may impose additional requirements on how banks manage and track Reputational and Sustainability Risk. In such cases, these are complied with in addition to Group policies and standards.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Culture and Sustainability Committee provides oversight for our Sustainability strategy while the Board Risk Committee oversees Reputational and Sustainability Risk as part of the ERMF. The Group Risk Committee (GRC) provides executive-level committee oversight and delegates the authority to ensure effective management of Reputational and Sustainability Risk to the Group Responsibility and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC).\n\nThe GRRRC's remit is to:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenge, constrain and, if required, stop business activities where Reputational and Sustainability risks are not aligned with the Group's Risk Appetite.\n- \u00b7 Make decisions on Reputational and Sustainability Risk matters assessed as high or very high based on the Group's Reputational and Sustainability Risk materiality assessment matrix, and matters escalated from the regions or client businesses.\n- \u00b7 Provide oversight of material Reputational and Sustainability Risk and/or thematic issues arising from the potential failure of other risk types.\n- \u00b7 Identify topical and emerging risks, as part of a dynamic risk scanning process\n- \u00b7 Monitor existing or new regulatory priorities\n\nThe Sustainable Finance Governance Committee, appointed by the GRRRC provides leadership, governance and oversight for delivering the Group's sustainable finance offering. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing and supporting the Group's frameworks for Green and Sustainable Products, and Transition Finance for approval of GRRRC. These frameworks set out the guidelines for approval of products and transactions which carry the sustainable finance and/or transition finance label.\n- \u00b7 Decision-making authority on the eligibility of a sustainable asset for any risk-weighted assets (RWA) relief.\n- \u00b7 Approving sustainable finance and transition finance labels for products in addition to regular product management and governance\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the reputational risks arising from greenwashing claims related to Sustainable Finance products and services.\n\nThe Group Non-Financial Risk Committee has oversight of the control environment and effective management of Reputational Risk incurred when there are negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions of the Group due to failure of other PRTs. The regional and client-business risk committees provide oversight on the Reputational and Sustainability Risk profile within their remit. The Country Non-Financial Risk Committee (CNFRC) provides oversight of the Reputational and Sustainability Risk profile at a country level.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Reputational and Sustainability RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Reputational and Sustainability Risk authorities is made. The Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates risk acceptance authorities for stakeholder perception risks to designated individuals in the first line and second line or to committees such as the GRRRC via risk authority matrices.\n\nThese risk authority matrices are tiered at country, regional, business segment or Group levels and are established for risks incurred in strategic coverage, clients, products or transactions. For environmental and social risks, the ESRM team must review and support the risk assessments for clients and transactions and escalate to the Reputational and Sustainability Risk leads as required.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nExposure to stakeholder perception risks arising from transactions, clients, products and strategic coverage are monitored through established triggers outlined in risk materiality matrices to prompt the right levels of risk-based consideration by the first line and escalations to the second line where necessary. Risk acceptance decisions and thematic trends are also being reviewed on a periodic basis.\n\nExposure to Sustainability Risk is monitored through triggers embedded within the first-line processes where environmental and social risks are considered for clients and transactions via the Environmental and Social Risk Assessments and considered for vendors in our supply chain through the Modern Slavery questionnaires.\n\nFurthermore, monitoring and reporting on the risk appetite metrics ensures that there is appropriate oversight by Management Team and Board over performance and breaches of thresholds across key metrices namely in concentration of material reputational risk, level of alignment with Group's Net Zero aspirations and Position Statements, and modern slavery risks in our suppliers.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nReputational Risk outcomes are taken into account in enterprise stress tests and incorporated into the Group's stress testing scenarios. For example, the Group might consider what impact a hypothetical event leading to loss of confidence among liquidity providers in a particular market might have, or what the implications might be for supporting part of the organization in order to protect the brand. As Sustainability Risk continues to evolve as an area of emerging regulatory focus with various markets developing ESG regulatory guidance, we are keeping pace with external developments to enable us to explore meaningful scenario analysis in the future with the aim of advancing Reputational and Sustainability Risk management.",

        "page_content": "## Climate Risk\n\nThe Group recognises Climate Risk as an Integrated Risk Type. Climate Risk is defined as the potential for financial loss and non-financial detriments arising from climate change and society's response to it.\n\nClimate Risk has been recognised as an emerging risk since 2017 and was elevated to an Integrated Risk Type (previously known as material cross-cutting risk) within the ERMF, our central risk framework in 2019. We have made further progress this year in embedding Climate risk considerations across the impacted PRTs and by using the results from our management scenario analysis, we are building a good understanding of the markets and industries where the effects of climate change will have the greatest impact. However, it is still a relatively nascent risk area which will mature and develop over time, particularly as data availability improves.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe three lines of defence model as per the Enterprise Risk Management Framework applies to Climate Risk. The GCRO has the ultimate second-line and senior management responsibility for Climate Risk. The GCRO is supported by the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management who has day-today oversight and central responsibility for second-line Climate Risk activities. As Climate Risk is integrated into the relevant PRTs, second-line responsibilities lie with the Risk Framework Owner (at Group, regional and country level), with subject matter expertise support from the central Climate Risk team.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs an Integrated Risk Type manifests through other PRTs, risk mitigation activities are specific to individual PRTs. The Group has made progress to integrate Climate Risk into PRT processes. Climate Risk assessments are considered as part of Reputational and Sustainability transaction reviews for clients and transactions in high carbon sectors. We have directly engaged with clients on their adaptation and mitigation plans using client level Climate Risk questionnaires and integrated climate risk into the credit process for ~70% of our corporate client exposure in CCIB. As part of quarterly credit portfolio reviews in CPBB, physical risk assessments for the residential mortgage portfolios are also being monitored for concentration levels.\n\nThe Traded Risk stress testing framework covers market impacts from Climate Risk - this includes a transition risk and two physical risk scenarios. Physical and transition risk ratings for sovereigns are widely used across the Group for risk management and reporting purposes.\n\nThe focus for Operational and Technology Risk was originally on Property, Resilience and Third-Party Risk management, and is now being expanded to material technology arrangements. We have also completed liquidity risk assessments for our top liquidity providers. Relevant policies and standards across PRTs have been updated to factor in Climate Risk considerations and a focus area for 2022 was to build out our risk management, data and modelling capabilities.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to measure and manage financial and non-financial risks from climate change, and reduce emissions related to our own activities and those related to the financing of clients in alignment with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard-level oversight is exercised through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and regular Climate Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC. At an executive level, the Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees implementation of the Climate Risk workplan. The GRC has also appointed a Climate Risk Management Committee consisting of senior representatives from the Business, Risk, Strategy and other functions such as Compliance, Audit and Finance. The Climate Risk Management Committee meets at least six times a year to oversee the implementation of Climate Risk workplan and progress in meeting regulatory requirements, monitor the Climate Risk profile of the Group and review Climate Risk-related disclosures and stress tests. We have also strengthened country and regional governance oversight for the Climate Risk profile across our key markets in 2022.\n\n## Tools and methodologies\n\nApplying existing risk management tools to quantify Climate Risk is challenging given inherent data and methodology challenges, including the need to be forward-looking over long time horizons. To quantify climate physical and transition risk we leverage and have invested in a number of areas, including tools and partnerships:\n\n- \u00b7 Munich Re - we are using Munich Re's physical risk assessment tool, which is built on extensive re-insurance experience.\n- \u00b7 Baringa Partners - we are using Baringa's flagship climate models to understand climate scenarios, and compute transition risk and temperature alignment.\n- \u00b7 Standard & Poor - we are leveraging S&P and Trucost's wealth of climate data covering asset locations, energy mixes and emissions.\n- \u00b7 Imperial College - we are leveraging Imperial's academic expertise to advance our understanding of climate science, upskill our staff and senior management, and\n- \u00b7 progress the state of independent research on climate risks with an acute focus on emerging markets.\n- \u00b7 Deloitte - we are working with Deloitte to build internal IFRS9 and stress testing models.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is supported by a centralised Climate Risk team within the ERM function. The Global Head, Climate Risk and Net Zero Oversight is responsible for ensuring and executing the delivery of the Climate Risk workplan which will define decision-making authorities and delegations across the Group.",

Management information and Risk Appetite metrics are also being progressively rolled out at the regional and country level.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nAs Climate Risk intensifies over time, the future global temperature rise will depend on today's transition pathway. Considering different transition scenarios is crucial to assessing Climate Risk over the next 10, 20 and 50 years. Stress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for Climate Risk and since 2020 physical and transition risks have been included in the PLC Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In 2022, the PLC Group undertook a number of Climate Risk stress tests, including by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and internal management scenario analysis. We will rely on these stress tests to understand the Group level vulnerabilities given the significant overlap between SC Bank and PLC Group's activities.\n\nIn 2023, the PLC Group intends to extend its management scenario capabilities, which will strengthen business strategy and financial planning and support the PLC Group's net zero journey.",

Digital Assets Risk is defined as the potential for regulatory penalties, financial loss and/or reputational damage to the Group resulting from digital assets exposure or digital assets related activities arising from the Group's Clients, Products and Projects.\n\nDigital Assets (DA) Risk has been managed under the Digital Assets Risk Management Approach since 2020 and was formalised as an Integrated Risk Type (previously known as material cross cutting risk) within the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF). Digital Assets Risk follows the prescribed robust risk management practices across the PRTs, with specific expertise applied from Digital Assets experts. Risk management practices take guidance from the 'Dear CEO' letters published by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in June 2018, with updated notices in June 2022. This is a developing risk area which will mature and stabilise over time as the technology and associated research becomes more established.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe three lines of defence model defined in the ERMF applies to Digital Assets Risk. The GCRO has the second-line and senior management responsibility for Digital Assets Risk with respect to the framework. The respective Business Segments Senior Managers are responsible for the overall management of Digital Assets initiatives within their segments.\n\nThe GCRO is supported by the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management and the Global Head, Digital Assets Risk Management who have day-to-day oversight and central responsibility for second line Digital Assets Risk activities. As Digital Assets Risk is integrated into the relevant PRTs, Risk Framework Owners (RFOs) and dedicated Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) across the PRTs also have second line responsibilities for Digital Assets Risk.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group deploys a DA specific policy to outline incremental risk management requirements for DA related activities. The Group's policies for other PRTs also include DA requirements where relevant Risk mitigation activities are also specific to individual PRTs and the Group has undertaken development and integration of Digital Assets Risk into the PRT processes. Digital Assets Risk Assessments are conducted on certain higher-risk DA related Projects and Products. These specific risk assessments detail the specific inherent risks, residual risks, controls and mitigants across the PRTs and are reviewed and supported by the respective RFOs and DA SMEs.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nAs Digital Assets Risk manifests through the various PRTs, the specific Risk Appetite statements for the PRTs apply.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard-level oversight is exercised through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and DA Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC, as requested. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees the risk management of DA. The GCRO has also appointed a dedicated Digital Assets Risk Committee (DRC) consisting of senior representatives, RFOs and SMEs across the Group including the business, risk, and other functions such as legal. The DRC meets at the pre-defined frequency, a minimum of four times per year, to review and assess the detailed risk assessments related to DA Projects and Products, discuss development and implementation of the DA risk management, and to provide structured governance around DA.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is supported by a centralised DA team within the ERM function and is responsible for the DA framework. The respective PRT RFOs and SMEs utilise decision making authorities granted to them within their respective PRTs or in individual capacities.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDigital Assets are monitored through the existing Group Risk Appetite metrics across the PRTs. In addition, specific Digital Assets Risk Appetite metrics are approved and reviewed annually by GRC. DA decisions relating to other PRTs are taken within the authorities for the respective PRT.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to help assess capital requirements for Digital Assets Risk and form part of the overall scenario analysis portfolio managed under the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework. Specific scenarios are developed annually with collaboration between the business, which owns and manages the risk, and the DA Risk function, to consider relevant DA scenarios. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the PLC Group's capital profile with respect to DA.",

        "page_content": "## Third Party Risk\n\nThe Group recognises Third Party Risk as an Integrated Risk Type. Third Party Risk is defined as the potential for loss or adverse impact from failure to manage multiple risks arising from the use of Third Parties, and is the aggregate of these risks.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe Global Head of Risk, Functions and Operational Risk has second line oversight responsibility for Third Party Risk as defined in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The three lines of defence model applies to Third Party Risk, and roles and responsibilities are further defined in the Third Party Risk Management Policy and Standard. It is important to note that as an Integrated Risk Type, the risks associated with the management of Third Parties materialise across multiple PRTs. The Risk Framework Owners for the PRTs are therefore responsible for embedding requirements to manage Third Party Risk within their Risk Type Frameworks, Policies and Standards as appropriate, and ensuring compliance to the minimum requirements defined by the Global Head of Risk, Functions and Operational Risk.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTo ensure we continue to prioritise the engagement of Third Parties, while safely managing any risks, the Third Party Risk Management Policy and Standard, in conjunction with the PRT Policies and Standards, holistically set out the Group's minimum controls requirements for the identification, mitigation and management of risks arising from the use of Third Parties. These minimum control requirements have been enhanced in 2022 to ensure compliance with new requirements issued by our regulators.\n\nThe Group aims to manage its risk profile within Risk Appetite, and in order to do so, Risk Appetite metrics for Third Party Risk are embedded within the respective PRTs including ICS, Compliance, Financial Crime and Operational and Technology Risk. To further supplement this, additional work is underway to enhance the Group's approach to concentration risk. Where appropriate, Risk Appetite metrics are cascaded to countries.\n\n## Governance Committee Oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Third Party Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee is responsible for the governance and oversight of Third Party Risk for the Group. The Group Third Party Risk Management Committee (GTPRMC), established under the Group Non-Financial Risk Committee, is responsible for overseeing all Third Party Risk types and associated risks across the Group, as well as the effective embedding of Third Party Risk across the respective PRTs.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThis IRT is supported by Risk Appetite metrics embedded within relevant PRTs. The engagement of Third Parties is essential for the Group to operate efficiently and effectively. This may introduce incremental risks which, if not managed correctly, could result in regulatory non-compliance, financial loss and/or adverse impact to clients. We continue to enhance our policies, standards, processes and controls to ensure we safely manage any incremental risks introduced by the use of Third Parties.\n\nThe management of Third Party Risk is overseen at a Country or entity level by the Country Third Party Risk Management Committee (CTPRMC). In smaller markets the responsibilities are exercised directly by the Executive Risk Committee (for subsidiaries) or Country Risk Committee (for branches).\n\n## Decision Making Authorities and Delegation\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer has second line responsibility for Third Party Risk under the Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk Officer has delegated the Integrated Risk Framework Owner responsibilities associated with Third Party Risk to the Global Head of Risk, Functions and Operational Risk, through the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Second line oversight and challenge responsibilities for Third Party Risk at a Country or entity level are delegated to the Country Chief Risk Officers.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe monitoring of Third Party Risk within the Group's Process Universe is managed in accordance with the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework.\n\nThe Third Party Risk management profile is reported to the GTPRMC, and includes the monitoring and oversight on Risk Appetite, assessment of new Third Party arrangements, on-going performance monitoring of Third Party arrangements, internal and external events and elevated risks with appropriate treatment plans.\n\n## Stress Testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements, and for Third Party Risk, form part of the overall scenario analysis portfolio managed under the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework. Specific scenarios are developed annually with collaboration between the business, which owns and manages the risk, and the second line of defence. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the Group's Risk profile.",

The Group is well capitalised with low leverage and high levels of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n|                                     | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| CET1 capital                        | 14.0%   | 14.1%   |\n| Tier 1 capital                      | 16.6%   | 16.6%   |\n| Total capital                       | 21.7%   | 21.3%   |\n| Leverage ratio                      | 4.8%    | 4.9%    |\n| MREL ratio                          | 32.1%   | 31.7%   |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWA) $million | 244,711 | 271,233 |\n\nThe Group's capital, leverage and MREL positions were all above current requirements and Board-approved Risk Appetite.\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital decreased 19 basis points to 14.0 per cent of RWA since FY2021. Profits and RWA optimisations were more than offset by distributions (including ordinary share buy-backs of $1.3 billion during the year), regulatory headwinds, movements in FVOCI and FX translation reserves and an increase in regulatory deductions.\n\nThe PRA updated the Group's Pillar 2A requirement during Q4 2022. As at 31 December 2022 the Group's Pillar 2A was 3.7 per cent of RWA, of which at least 2.1 per cent must be held in CET1 capital. The Group's minimum CET1 capital requirement was 10.4 per cent at 31 December 2022. The UK countercyclical buffer increased to 1.0 per cent which impacts Group CET1 minimum requirement by approximately 8 basis points from December 2022.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 RWA increased due to (a) post model adjustments following new PRA rules on IRB models resulted in approximately $5.7 billion of additional RWA and (b) the introduction of standardised rules for Counterparty Credit Risk on derivatives and other instruments resulted in approximately $1.9 billion of additional RWA. These regulatory changes including removal of software benefit and others reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 80 basis points.\n\nThe Group CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2022 reflects the share buy-backs of $754 million completed in the first half of 2022 and $504 million completed in the third and fourth quarter of 2022. The CET1 capital ratio also includes an accrual for the FY 2022 dividend. The Board has recommended a final dividend for FY 2022 of $405 million or 14 cents per share resulting in a full year 2022 dividend of 18 cents per share, a 50 per cent increase on the 2021 dividend. In addition, the Board has announced a further share buyback of $1 billion, the impact of this will reduce the Group's CET1 capital by around 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Group expects to manage CET1 capital dynamically within our 13-14 per cent target range, in support of our aim of delivering future sustainable shareholder distributions.\n\nThe Group's MREL leverage requirement as at 31 December 2022 was 27.3 per cent of RWA. This is composed of a minimum requirement of 23.6 per cent of RWA and the Group's combined buffer (comprising the capital conservation buffer, the G-SII buffer and the countercyclical buffer). The Group's MREL ratio was 32.1 per cent of RWA and 9.2 per cent of leverage exposure at 31 December 2022.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group successfully raised $7.2 billion of MREL eligible securities from its holding company, Standard Chartered PLC. Issuance was across the capital structure including $1.3 billion of Additional Tier 1, $0.8 billion of Tier 2 and $5.2 billion of callable senior debt.\n\nThe Group is a G-SII, with a 1.0 per cent G-SII CET1 capital buffer. The Standard Chartered PLC G-SII disclosure is published at: sc.com/en/investors/financial-results.",

$1.3 billion, regulatory changes including removal of software benefits of $1.2 billion and an increase in regulatory deductions and other movements of $0.7 billion\n- \u00b7 AT1 capital decreased by

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing a risk assessment to identify factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting, including the impact of external risks such as geopolitical risk.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's forecast capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios over the period of twelve months from 16 February 2023 to evaluate the headroom against the minimum regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Engaging internal valuation and economic specialists to assess the reasonableness of assumptions used to develop the forecasts in the Corporate Plan and evaluating the accuracy of historical forecasting.\n- \u00b7 Inspecting the Group's funding plan and repayment plan for funding instruments maturing over the period of twelve months from 16 February 2023.\n- \u00b7 Understanding and evaluating credit rating agency ratings and actions.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the results of management's stress testing, including consideration of principal and emerging risks, on funding, liquidity, and regulatory capital.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing correspondence with prudential regulators and authorities for matters that may impact the going concern assessment; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern disclosure included in note 1 to the financial statements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from 16 February 2023.",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We took into account the size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of control environment, changes in the business environment and other factors such as the level of issues and misstatements noted in prior period when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 367 reporting units of the Group, we selected 64 reporting units which represent 26 components in 21 countries: Bangladesh, Cameroon, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Mainland China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of Ireland, Republic of South Africa, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America and Zambia. The definition of a component is aligned with the structure of the Group's consolidation system, typically these are either a branch, group of branches, group of subsidiaries, a subsidiary, or an associate.\n\nWe took a centralised approach to auditing certain processes and controls, as well as the substantive testing of specific balances. This included audit work over Group's Global Business Services shared services centre, Commercial, Corporate and Institutional Banking, Credit Impairment and Technology.\n\nOf the 26 components selected in 21 countries, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 15 components in 12 countries ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 11 components in 9 countries ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the Group financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 82% (2021: 81%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 89% (2021: 89%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 95% (2021: 96%) of the Group's total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 72% (2021: 74%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 79% (2021: 81%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 87% (2021: 88%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nThe specific scope components contributed 10% (2021: 7%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 10% (2021: 8%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 8% (2021: 8%) of the Group's total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group, overall.\n\nOf the remaining 303 reporting units that together represent 18% of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, none individually contributed more than 2% of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT. For the components represented by these reporting units, we performed other procedures at the Group level which included: performing analytical reviews at the Group financial statement line item level, testing entity level controls, performing audit procedures on the centralised shared service centres, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations, inquiring with overseas EY teams on the outcome of prior year local statutory audits (where audited by EY) to identify any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n## Absolute adjusted profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n72% Full scope components\n\n10% Specific scope components\n\n18% Other procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Absolute operating income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n79% Full scope components\n\n10% Specific scope components\n\n11% Other procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total assets\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Changes from the prior year\n\nWe assessed our 2022 audit scope with consideration of history or expectation of unusual or complex transactions and potential for material misstatements. We also kept our audit scope under review throughout the year.\n\nOne component (Germany) which was included in our prior year audit scope and assigned full scope, which represents 0.03% (2021:0.4%) of the current year absolute adjusted PBT, 1.3% of the Group's total assets (2021:1%) and 0.6% of the Group's absolute operating income (2021:0.8%), was excluded from the Group audit scope in the current year based on our updated risk assessment. For this component as well as Philippines, Uganda and Jordan, the Primary Audit Team performed certain procedures centrally over the cash balances as at 31 December 2022. Nigeria and Bangladesh were full scope components in the prior year but were designated as specific scope components in the current year based on our updated risk assessment.\n\nIn 2022 we assigned a specific scope to Cameroon, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zambia components that are significant based on risk. These components were not in-scope in the prior year.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms and another firm operating under our instructions.\n\nOf the 15 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these (including the audit of the Company) directly by the Primary Audit Team (EY London) in the United Kingdom. For 2 specific scope components, the audit procedures were performed by the Primary Audit Team. Where components were audited by the Primary Team, this was under the direction and supervision of the Senior Statutory Auditor.\n\nFor the remaining 22 components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our audit opinion on the Group as a whole. In addition, the Group has centralised processes and controls over key areas in its shared service centres. Members of the Primary Audit Team undertook direct oversight, review and coordination of our shared service centre audits.\n\nThe Primary Audit Team undertook visits to component teams and shared services centres. During the current year's audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Primary Audit Team to the component teams in the following locations:\n\n- \u00b7 Bangladesh\n- \u00b7 India (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 Hong Kong\n- \u00b7 Singapore (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 Malaysia (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 Indonesia\n- \u00b7 Republic of Korea\n- \u00b7 United Arab Emirates\n- \u00b7 United States of America\n\nThese visits involved oversight of work undertaken at those locations, discussion of the audit approach and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local management, and reviewing relevant audit working papers on key risk areas.\n\nIn addition to the site visits, the Primary Audit Team interacted regularly with the component and shared services centre audit teams where appropriate during the audit, reviewed relevant working papers remotely and were responsible for the overall scoping and direction of the audit process.\n\nThe programme of our visits to component team and shared service centres located in China was impacted by the travel restrictions and other imposed government measures which are still in place from the prior year as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (albeit less so when compared to the prior year). For this location, oversight of the work was performed remotely through established EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\nWe also undertook video conference meetings with local audit teams and management. These virtual meetings involved discussing the audit approach with the component and shared service centres team and any issues arising from their work and performing remote reviews of key audit workpapers.\n\nThis, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group and Company financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact the economy, including the banking sector, and further how this may consequently impact the valuation of assets and liabilities held on bank balance sheets. The Group has determined climate risk to be a Primary Integrated Risk Type and the assessment of that risk is explained on pages 316 and 317 in the 'Risk review: Climate Risk' section and on pages 64 to 123 in the 'Sustainability' section of the Annual Report, where they have also explained their climate commitments.\n\nAll of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in the 'Sustainability' section of the Annual Report how they have reflected the impact of climate change in their financial statements, including how this aligns with their commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change are included in the section 'Significant accounting estimates and critical judgements' of note 1 to the financial statements, which also provides the narrative explanation of the impact of climate risk on credit risk and lending portfolios under the requirements of UK adopted IAS and EU IFRS. As stated in these disclosures, the Group, having acknowledged the limitations of current data available, increasing sophistication of models, and the evolving and nascent nature of climate impacts on internal and client assets, has concluded climate risk to have limited quantitative impact in the immediate term.",

        "page_content": "Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating whether management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, and the significant judgements and estimates disclosed in note 1 have been appropriately reflected in the valuation of assets and liabilities, where these can be reliably measured, following the requirements of UK adopted IAS and EU IFRS. This was in the context of the Group's process being limited, given that this is an emerging area, as a result of limitations in the data available and the availability of sophisticated models, and as the Group considers how it further embeds its climate ambitions into the planning process.\n\nAs part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability, and the associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work, we have considered the impact of climate change on the financial statements to impact the key audit matter of Credit Impairment. Details of our procedures and findings are included in our explanation of key audit matters below.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                               | Our response to the risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Key observations communicated   to the Audit Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk  1.

Valuation of financial instruments  held at fair value with higher risk  characteristics Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 165);  Accounting policies (page 371); and Note 13 of  the financial statements. At 31 December 2022, the Group reported | We evaluated the design and operating  effectiveness of controls relating to the  valuation of financial instruments, including  independent price verification, model review  and approval, fair value adjustments,   income statement analysis and reporting. Among other procedures, we engaged our  valuation specialists to assist the audit team | We concluded that assumptions  used by management to estimate  the fair value of financial  instruments with higher risk  characteristics and the recognition  of related income were  reasonable. We highlighted the  following matters to the Audit |\n\nThe key audit matters remain consistent from prior year, except that following the decline of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated decrease in related uncertainties, the key audit matter in respect of the impairment of non-financial assets has become limited to the impairment assessment of goodwill and investments in subsidiary undertakings.\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be $234 million (2021: $195 million), which is 5% (2021: 5%) of adjusted PBT. This reflects actual PBT adjusted for non-recurring items relating to restructuring costs and impairment of China Bohai Bank. We believe that adjusted PBT provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the financial statements, given the Group is profit making, it is consistent with the wider industry, it is the standard for listed and regulated entities and we believe it reflects the most relevant measure for users of the financial statements. We also believe that the adjustments are appropriate as they relate to material non-recurring items.",

This assessment resulted in higher final materiality calculated based on the actual financial performance of the Group for the year. There were no changes to the basis for materiality calculation from the planning stage.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $210million (2021: $176 million) which is 0.4% (2021: 0.33%) of the equity of the Parent Company. We believe that equity provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the Parent Company's financial statements, given that the Parent Company is primarily a holding company.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2021: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $117 million (2021: $98 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage based on a variety of risk assessment factors such as the expectation of misstatements, internal control environment considerations and other factors such as the global complexity of the Group.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative size and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $8.8 million to $34.1 million (2021: $8 million to $29 million).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $11 million (2021: $10 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWhen forming our opinion, we evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above as well as other relevant qualitative criteria.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 509, including the Strategic report (pages 1 to 133), the Directors' report (pages 134 to 230), the Statement of directors' responsibilities (page 231) and the information not marked as 'audited' in the Risk review and Capital review section (pages 232 to 325), and the Supplementary information (pages 474 to 509), other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 219;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 132 and 133;\n- \u00b7 Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 133;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 218;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 222;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 232 to 325; and\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 163 to 169.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 231, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK-adopted IAS and EU IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Listing Rules, the Main Board Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange), regulations and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), FRC, FCA and other overseas regulatory requirements, including but not limited to regulations in its major markets such as Hong Kong, India, Singapore, the United States of America, and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations relating to regulatory capital and liquidity, conduct, financial crime including anti-money laundering, sanctions and market abuse recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by performing a combination of inquiries of senior management and those charged with governance as required by auditing standards, review of board and certain committee meeting minutes, gaining an understanding of the Group's approach to governance, inspection of regulatory correspondence in the year and engaging with internal and external legal counsel. We also engaged EY financial crime and forensics specialists to perform procedures on areas relating to anti-money laundering, whistleblowing, and sanctions compliance. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance. The identified actual or suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit that would have resulted in being identified as a key audit matter.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the controls that the Group has established to address risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. Our procedures to address the risks identified also included incorporation of unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates and journal entry testing.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of the Group's internal and external legal counsel, money laundering reporting officer, internal audit, certain senior management executives and focused testing on a sample basis, including journal entry testing. We also performed inspection of key regulatory correspondence from the relevant regulatory authorities as well as review of board and committee minutes.\n- \u00b7 For instances of actual or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations, which have a material impact on the financial statements, these were communicated by management to the Group audit engagement team and component teams (where applicable) who performed audit procedures such as inquiries with management, sending confirmations to external legal counsel, substantive testing and meeting with regulators. Where appropriate, we involved specialists from our firm to support the audit team.\n- \u00b7 The Group is authorised to provide banking, insurance, mortgages and home finance, consumer credit, pensions, investments and other activities. The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the Group audit engagement team, the component teams and the shared service centre teams to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were re-appointed by the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2022 and subsequent financial periods.\n\nThe period of total uninterrupted engagement is three years, covering the years ended 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David Canning Jones (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nLondon\n\n16 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 1. Accounting policies\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Group financial statements consolidate Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group's interests in associates and jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity.\n\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in conformity with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThere are no significant differences between UK-adopted international accounting standards and EU IFRS.\n\nThe following parts of the Risk review and Capital review form part of these financial statements:\n\na) Risk review: Disclosures marked as 'audited' from the start of the Credit Risk section (page 236) to the end of Other principal risks in the same section (page 319).\n\nb) Capital review: Tables marked as 'audited' from the start of 'CRD Capital base' to the end of 'Movement in total capital', excluding 'Total risk-weighted assets' (pages 321 to 322).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of cash-settled share-based payments, fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ($), being the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the Company, and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars, except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant and other accounting estimates and judgement\n\nIn determining the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the Group makes assumptions of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The Group's estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically. Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgement, are set out in the relevant disclosure notes for the areas set out under the relevant headings below:\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and critical judgements\n\nSignificant accounting estimates and judgements represent those items which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year. Significant accounting estimates and judgements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit impairment, including evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments, and determination of probability weightings for Stage 3 individually assessed provisions (Note 8)\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments measured at fair value (Note 13)\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates - China Bohai associate accounting and impairment analysis (Note 32)\n\n## Other areas of accounting estimate and judgement\n\nOther areas of accounting estimate and judgement do not meet the definition under IAS 1 of significant accounting estimates or critical accounting judgements, but the recognition of certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to long-term uncertainties. The other areas of accounting estimate and judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Note 10)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill impairment (Note 17)\n- \u00b7 Property, plant and equipment (Note 18)\n- \u00b7 Recoverable amounts for aircraft operating lease assets (Note 18)\n- \u00b7 Retirement benefit obligations (Note 30)\n- \u00b7 Provisions for liabilities and charges (Note 24)\n- \u00b7 Share-based payments (Note 31)\n\n## Climate impact on the Group's balance sheet\n\nClimate, and the impact of climate on the Group's balance sheet is considered as an area of significant accounting estimate and judgment through the uncertainty of future events and the impact of that uncertainty on the Group's assets and liabilities. It is noted that although not currently quantitatively material, the Group considers climate to be qualitatively material to the Group.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of climate risk on the financial report. This is set out within the Sustainable and Responsible Business chapter on pages 64 to 66 which incorporates the Group's Climate-related Financial Disclosures which align with the recommendations from the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Further risk disclosure has been provided on pages 301 and 319 of the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Annual Report where the Group has described how it manages climate risk as an Integrated Risk Type.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Accounting policies continued\n\nThe areas of impact and where judgements and the use of estimates have been applied were credit risk and the impact on lending portfolios; Environmental, Sustainability or Governance (ESG) features within issued loans and bonds; physical risk on our mortgage lending portfolio; and, the corporate plan, in respect of which forward looking cash flows impact the recoverability of certain assets, including of goodwill, deferred tax assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings.\n\nThis assessment on the corporate loan portfolio was undertaken by considering the maturity profile of the loan portfolio which is majority shorter term. Transition risk, as our clients move to lower carbon emitting revenues, (either by virtue of legislation or changing end customer preference) is considered with reference to client transition pathways and manifests over a longer term than the maturity of the loan book (up to 2050). Further transition risk is managed through reviews of clients with ESG risk by the Group's Risk function, and through an ongoing process of identifying clients which have transition pathways that are Paris 1.5 degree compliant and congruent with the Groups.\n\nPhysical risk is already included within the majority of our mortgage lending and we have applied scenario analysis against the pathways of different temperature additions and country policy scenarios. We also assess the impact of climate risk on the classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9, when ESG triggers may affect the cash flows received by the Group under the contractual terms of the instrument.\n\nThe Group Climate Risk team have performed a top-down quantitative assessment of the impact of climate risk on the IFRS 9 ECL provision. This assessment has been performed across both the CCIB and CPBB portfolios. CCIB includes Corporates, Sovereign, Asset Backed Securities, Commercial and Specialised Lending. CPBB includes Mortgages, Personal Loans and Credit Cards. The climate adjusted ECL was estimated by adding climate scalars (multiplicative adjustments) to the business as usual ECL. The scalars, such as LGD increases, have been informed by the judgement of using three Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) pathways/scenarios, being Early Action, Late Action and No Additional Action. These pathways have been probability weighted and generally include the addition of carbon charges/taxes over time to model transition risk. The impact assessment which is considered a resulted in an marginal ECL increase across CCIB and CPBB which will not be recorded as an overlay for the 2022 year end (in line with our view that the quantitative impact of Climate Risk is currently limited).\n\nThe Group's corporate plan has a 5 year outlook and already includes where we have committed to transitioning away from certain high carbon sectors (i.e. coal), offset by transition finance opportunities. This is shorter term than many of the climate scenario outlooks but seeks to capture the nearer term performance as required by recoverability models. We have for the first time in the 2023 corporate plan included anticipated ECL charges linked to climate for three sectors (Oil and Gas, Metals and Mining and Power) over the 5 years. This addition of ECL has not in itself, impacted the recoverability of assets supported by discounted cash flow models (such as Value in Use) which utilise the corporate plan.\n\nWith the aim to enhance our internal scenario analysis capabilities in line with our Risk Appetite Statement, in 2022 we assessed the impact on our CCIB corporate client portfolio based on three International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios and three Phase 2 scenarios from the NGFS (Which align to the CBES scenarios) and participated in the Monetary Authority of Singapore Industry-Wide Stress Test. We also assessed the impact of sea level rises under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios to explore the Physical Risk impact on the Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) residential mortgage portfolio over short- and long-term time horizons for internal risk management purposes. Notwithstanding these challenges, our work to date, using certain assumptions and proxies, indicates that our business is resilient to all Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and IEA scenarios that were explored.\n\nThe Group, although acknowledging the limitations of current data available, increasing sophistication of models evolving and nascent nature of climate impacts on internal and client assets, considers Climate Risk to have limited quantitative impact in the immediate term and as a longer term risk will be addressed through its business strategy and financial planning as the Group implements its net zero journey.\n\n## IFRS and Hong Kong accounting requirements\n\nAs required by the Hong Kong Listing Rules, an explanation of the differences in accounting practices between UKadopted IFRS and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards is required to be disclosed. There would be no significant differences had these accounts been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n## Comparatives\n\nCertain comparatives have been restated in line with current year disclosures. Details of these changes are set out in the relevant sections and notes below:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 2 Segmental information\n- \u00b7 Note 4 Net fees and commission\n- \u00b7 Note 12 Earnings per ordinary share\n- \u00b7 Note 13 Financial instruments\n- \u00b7 Note 14 Derivative financial instruments\n- \u00b7 Note 33 Structured entities\n- \u00b7 Note 36 Related party transactions\n- \u00b7 Risk review: various credit risk tables for new segment Ventures and Operational Risk events and losses\n- \u00b7 Capital review: new segment Ventures\n\n## New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 (and subsequently amended in June 2020) to replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and to establish a comprehensive standard for inceptors of insurance policies. The Group will apply IFRS 17 for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2023. IFRS 17 will not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.",

The directors have made an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment has been made having considered the impact of COVID-19, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the Group Strategy and Corporate Plan\n- \u00b7 An assessment of the actual performance to date, loan book quality, credit impairment, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and the updated annual budget\n- \u00b7 Consideration of stress testing performed, including both the Bank of England annual stress test and a Group Recovery and Resolution Plan (RRP) as submitted to the PRA. Both these submissions include the application of stressed scenarios including; COVID additional waves with the accompanying economic shocks, credit impact and short term liquidity shocks. Under the tests and through the range of scenarios, the results of these exercises and the RRP demonstrate that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue as a going concern and meet minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements\n\n## 2. Segmental information\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe analysis reflects how the client segments and geographic regions are managed internally. This is described as the Management View (on an underlying basis) and is principally the location from which a client relationship is managed, which may differ from where it is financially booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. In certain instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financial View is disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance was booked. Typically, the Financial View is used in areas such as the Market and Liquidity Risk reviews where actual booking location is more important for an assessment. Segmental information is therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the capital, funding and liquidity position of the Group, including the capital and leverage ratios, and ICAAP which summarises the Group's capital and risk assessment processes, assesses its capital requirements and the adequacy of resources to meet them. Further, funding and liquidity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, including the ADR and LCR ratios\n- \u00b7 The Group's Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liquidity position, its framework and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due, was also reviewed\n- \u00b7 The level of debt in issue, including redemptions and issuances during the year, debt falling due for repayment in the next 12 months and further planned debt issuances, including the appetite in the market for the Group's debt\n- \u00b7 A detailed review of all principal and emerging risks\n\nBased on the analysis performed, the directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from 16 February 2023. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the financial statements.\n\n## Segments and regions\n\nThe Group's segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal performance framework and as presented to the Group's Management Team.\n\nAs part of the ongoing execution of its refreshed strategy, the Group has expanded and reorganised its reporting structure with the creation of a third client segment, Ventures, effective on 1st January 2022. Ventures is a consolidation of SC Ventures and its related entities as well as the Group's two majority-owned digital banks Mox in Hong Kong and Trust Bank in Singapore.\n\n- \u00b7 SC Ventures is the platform and catalyst for the Group to promote innovation, invest in disruptive financial technology and explore alternative business models\n- \u00b7 Mox, a cloud-native, mobile only digital bank, was launched in Hong Kong as a joint venture with HKT, PCCW and Ctrip in September 2020\n- \u00b7 Trust Bank was launched in Singapore in partnership with FairPrice Group, the nation's leading grocery retailer, in September 2022\n\nThe changes above require comparative periods to be restated.",

Segmental information continued\n\n## Restructuring items excluded from underlying results\n\nThe Group's statutory IFRS performance is adjusted for certain items to arrive at alternative performance measures. These items include profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/or exceptional transactions that are significant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinarily identify separately when assessing consistent performance period by period. The alternative performance measures are not within the scope of IFRS and not a substitute for IFRS measures. These adjustments are set out below.\n\nRestructuring charges of $174 million primarily relate to redundancies partly offset by income from the Principal Finance and Ship Leasing portfolios.\n\nReconciliations between underlying and statutory results are set out in the tables below:\n\n|                                                                | 2022                 | 2022                        | 2022                    | 2022                                                            | 2022                                        | 2022                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                | Underlying  $million | Regulatory   fine  $million | Restructuring  $million | Net gain on  businesses  disposed of/   held for sale  $million | Goodwill   and other  impairment 1 $million | Statutory   $million |\n| Operating income                                               | 16,255               | -

Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nInterest income for financial assets held at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, and interest expense on all financial liabilities held at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. For floating-rate financial instruments, periodic re-estimation of cash flows that reflect the movements in the market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate. Where the estimates of cash flows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability is adjusted to reflect the actual and revised cash flows, discounted at the instruments original effective interest rate. The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revision is made as long as the change in estimates is not due to credit issues.\n\nInterest income for financial assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition (stage 3) and have had amounts written off, is recognised using the credit adjusted effective interest rate. This rate is calculated in the same manner as the effective interest rate except that expected credit losses are included in the expected cash flows. Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the financial asset including expected credit losses. Should the credit risk on a stage 3 financial asset improve such that the financial asset is no longer considered credit-impaired, interest income recognition reverts to a computation based on the rehabilitated gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n\n|                                                                                       | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Balances at central banks                                                             | 765              | 92               |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                                           | 853              | 490              |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                                       | 10,032           | 7, 3 47          |\n| Debt securities                                                                       | 2,836            | 1,787            |\n| Other eligible bills                                                                  | 630              | 303              |\n| Accrued on impaired assets (discount unwind) 1                                        | 136              | 227              |\n| Interest income                                                                       | 15,252           | 10,246           |\n| Of which: financial instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 2,167            | 1,541            |\n| Deposits by banks                                                                     | 433              | 136              |\n| Customer accounts                                                                     | 5,443            | 2,196            |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                              | 1,169            | 566              |\n| Subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds                                     | 570              | 497              |\n| Interest expense on IFRS 16 lease liabilities                                         | 44               | 53               |\n| Interest expense                                                                      | 7, 6 59          | 3,448            |\n| Net interest income                                                                   | 7, 593           | 6,798            |\n\n## 4. Net fees and commission\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nFees and commissions charged for services provided by the Group are recognised as revenue when the Group satisfies the performance obligations to the customer. Services provided by the Group are either satisfied at point in time or over time. Fees and commission income are measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer.\n\nThe Group can act as trustee or in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. The assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets and income of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Net fees and commission continued\n\nThe Group applies the following practical expedients:\n\n- \u00b7 information on amounts of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period is not disclosed as almost all fee-earning contracts have an expected duration of less than one year\n- \u00b7 promised consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between the Group providing a service and the customer paying for it is expected to be less than one year\n- \u00b7 incremental costs of obtaining a fee-earning contract are recognised upfront in 'Fees and commission expense' rather than amortised, if the expected term of the contract is less than one year\n\nThe determination of the services performed for the customer, the transaction price, and when the services are completed depends on the nature of the product with the customer. The main considerations on income recognition by product are as follows:\n\n## Transaction Banking\n\nThe Group recognises fee income associated with transactional trade and cash management at the point in time the service is provided. The Group recognises income associated with trade contingent risk exposures (such as letters of credit and guarantees) over the period in which the service is provided.\n\nPayment of fees is usually received at the same time the service is provided. In some cases, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Group have annual upfront premiums, which are amortised on a straight-line basis to fee income over the year.\n\n## Financial Markets\n\nThe Group recognises fee income at the point in time the service is provided. Fee income is recognised for a significant nonlending service when the transaction has been completed and the terms of the contract with the customer entitle the Group to the fee. This includes fees such as structuring and advisory fees. Fees are usually received shortly after the service is provided.\n\nSyndication fees are recognised when the syndication is complete, defined as achieving the final approved hold position. Fees are generally received before completion of the syndication, or within 12 months of the transaction date.\n\nSecurities services include custody services, fund accounting and administration, and broker clearing. Fees are recognised over the period the custody or fund management services are provided, or as and when broker services are requested.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nUpfront consideration on bancassurance agreements is amortised straight-line over the contractual term. Commissions for bancassurance activities are recorded as they are earned through sales of third-party insurance products to customers. These commissions are received within a short time frame of the commission being earned. Target-linked fees are accrued based on percentage of the target achieved, provided it is assessed as highly probable that the target will be met. Cash payment is received at a contractually specified date after achievement of a target has been confirmed.\n\nUpfront and trailing commissions for managed investment placements are recorded as they are confirmed. Income from these activities is relatively even throughout the period, and cash is usually received within a short time frame after the commission is earned.\n\n## Retail Products\n\nThe Group recognises most income at the point in time the Group is entitled to the fee, since most services are provided at the time of the customer's request.\n\nCredit card annual fees are recognised over the service period. In most of our retail markets there are circumstances under which fees are waived, income recognition is adjusted to reflect customer's intent to pay the annual fee. The Group defers the fair value of reward points on its credit card reward programmes, and recognises income and costs associated with fulfilling the reward at the time of redemption.",

Net fees and commission continued\n\nUpfront bancassurance consideration amounts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the contractual period to which the consideration relates. Deferred income on the balance sheet in respect of these activities is $549 million (2021: $634 million). The income will be earned evenly over the next 6.5 years (2021: 7.5 years). For the twelve months ended 31 December 2022, $84 million of fee income was released from deferred income (2021: $84 million).\n\nThe Group has recognised revenue of $160 million from one of its bancassurance contracts based on confirmation from the counterparty that the annual performance bonus will be paid to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## 5. Net trading income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in net trading income in the period in which they arise. This includes contractual interest receivable or payable.\n\nIncome is recognised from the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins on market making and customer business and fair value changes.\n\nWhen the initial fair value of a financial instrument held at fair value through profit or loss relies on unobservable inputs, the difference between the initial valuation and the transaction price is amortised to net trading income as the inputs become observable or over the life of the instrument, whichever is shorter. Any unamortised 'day one' gain is released to net trading income if the transaction is terminated.\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Net trading income                                                              | 5,310            | 3,431            |\n| Significant items within net trading income include:                            |                  |                  |\n| Gains on instruments held for trading 1                                         | 4,942            | 3,381            |\n| Gains on financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss      | 1,087            | 181              |\n| Losses on financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss      | (6)              | (8)              |\n| Losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss | (677)            | (133)            |\n\n## 6.

Credit impairment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group's expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions. The significant judgements in determining ECL include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Development of expected credit loss models, including the choice of inputs relating to macroeconomic variables;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments;\n- \u00b7 Determination of probability weightings for Stage 3 individually assessed provisions\n\nThe calculation of credit impairment provisions also involves expert credit judgement to be applied by the credit risk management team based upon counterparty information they receive from various sources including relationship managers and on external market information. Details on the approach for determining ECL can be found in the credit risk section, under IFRS 9 Methodology (page 236).\n\nEstimates of forecasts of key macroeconomic variables underlying the ECL calculation can be found within the Risk review, Key assumptions and judgements in determining expected credit loss (page 271).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nECL are determined for all financial debt instruments that are classified at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, undrawn commitments and financial guarantees.\n\nAn ECL represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financial asset, undrawn commitment or financial guarantee.\n\nA cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive over the contractual life of the instrument.\n\n## Measurement\n\nECL are computed as unbiased, probability-weighted amounts which are determined by evaluating a range of reasonably possible outcomes, the time value of money, and considering all reasonable and supportable information including that which is forward-looking.\n\nFor material portfolios, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). There may be multiple default events over the lifetime of an instrument. Further details on the components of PD, LGD and EAD are disclosed in the Credit risk section. For less material Retail Banking loan portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophisticated approaches based on historical roll rates or loss rates.\n\nForward-looking economic assumptions are incorporated into the PD, LGD and EAD where relevant and where they influence credit risk, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, house price indices and commodity prices among others. These assumptions are incorporated using the Group's most likely forecast for a range of macroeconomic assumptions. These forecasts are determined using all reasonable and supportable information, which includes both internally developed forecasts and those available externally, and are consistent with those used for budgeting, forecasting and capital planning.\n\nTo account for the potential non-linearity in credit losses, multiple forward-looking scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes for all material portfolios. For example, where there is a greater risk of downside credit losses than upside gains, multiple forward-looking economic scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in respect of determining the PD (and where relevant, the LGD and EAD) and in determining the overall ECL amounts. These scenarios are determined using a Monte Carlo approach centred around the Group's most likely forecast of macroeconomic assumptions.\n\nThe period over which cash shortfalls are determined is generally limited to the maximum contractual period for which the Group is exposed to credit risk. However, for certain revolving credit facilities, which include credit cards or overdrafts, the Group's exposure to credit risk is not limited to the contractual period. For these instruments, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on the period that the Group is exposed to credit risk, which includes the effect of credit risk management actions such as the withdrawal of undrawn facilities.\n\nFor credit-impaired financial instruments, the estimate of cash shortfalls may require the use of expert credit judgement.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impairment continued\n\nThe estimate of expected cash shortfalls on a collateralised financial instrument reflects the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of obtaining and selling the collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is deemed probable.\n\nCash flows from unfunded credit enhancements held are included within the measurement of expected credit losses if they are part of, or integral to, the contractual terms of the instrument (this includes financial guarantees, unfunded risk participations and other non-derivative credit insurance). Although non-integral credit enhancements do not impact the measurement of expected credit losses, a reimbursement asset is recognised to the extent of the ECL recorded.\n\nCash shortfalls are discounted using the effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments (POCI)) on the financial instrument as calculated at initial recognition or if the instrument has a variable interest rate, the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.\n\n## Instruments\n\n## Location of expected credit loss provisions\n\n| Financial assets held at amortised cost        | Loss provisions: netted against gross carrying value\u00b9             |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets held FVOCI - Debt instruments | Other comprehensive income (FVOCI expected credit loss reserve) 2 |\n| Loan commitments                               | Provisions for liabilities and charges 3                          |\n| Financial guarantees                           | Provisions for liabilities and charges 3                          |\n\n- 1 Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets do not attract an expected credit loss provision on initial recognition. An expected credit loss provision will be recognised only if there is an increase in expected credit losses from that considered at initial recognition\n- 2   Debt and treasury securities classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are held at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The expected credit loss attributed to these instruments is held as a separate reserve within other comprehensive income (OCI) and is recycled to the profit and loss account along with any fair value measurement gains or losses held within FVOCI when the applicable instruments are derecognised\n- 3   Expected credit loss on loan commitments and financial guarantees is recognised as a liability provision. Where a financial instrument includes both a loan (i.e. financial asset component) and an undrawn commitment (i.e. loan commitment component), and it is not possible to separately identify the expected credit loss on these components, expected credit loss amounts on the loan commitment are recognised together with expected credit loss amounts on the financial asset. To the extent the combined expected credit loss exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit loss is recognised as a liability provision\n\n## Recognition\n\n12 months expected credit losses (stage 1) Expected credit losses are recognised at the time of initial recognition of a financial instrument and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls arising from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. Expected credit losses continue to be determined on this basis until there is either a significant increase in the credit risk of an instrument or the instrument becomes credit-impaired. If an instrument is no longer considered to exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, expected credit losses will revert to being determined on a 12-month basis.\n\nSignificant increase in credit risk (Stage 2) If a financial asset experiences a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, an expected credit loss provision is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifetime of the asset.\n\nSignificant increase in credit risk is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at origination (after taking into account the passage of time). Significant does not mean statistically significant nor is it assessed in the context of changes in expected credit loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is significant or not is assessed using a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, the weight of which depends on the type of product and counterparty. Financial assets that are 30 or more days past due and not credit-impaired will always be considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios where a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to compute expected credit loss, significant increase in credit risk is primarily based on 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitative factors include an assessment of whether there has been significant increase in the forward-looking probability of default (PD) since origination. A forward-looking PD is one that is adjusted for future economic conditions to the extent these are correlated to changes in credit risk. We compare the residual lifetime PD at the balance sheet date to the residual lifetime PD that was expected at the time of origination for the same point in the term structure and determine whether both the absolute and relative change between the two exceeds predetermined thresholds. To the extent that the differences between the measures of default outlined exceed the defined thresholds, the instrument is considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nQualitative factors assessed include those linked to current credit risk management processes, such as lending placed on non-purely precautionary early alert (and subject to closer monitoring).\n\nA non-purely precautionary early alert account is one which exhibits risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requiring closer monitoring, supervision, or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of repayment prospects and the likelihood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of position within the industry, concerns over management's ability to manage operations, weak/ deteriorating operating results, liquidity strain and overdue balances among other factors.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impairment continued\n\nCredit-impaired (or defaulted) exposures (Stage 3) Financial assets that are credit-impaired (or in default) represent those that are at least 90 days past due in respect of principal and/or interest. Financial assets are also considered to be credit-impaired where the obligors are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one or more observable events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event but instead the combined effect of several events may cause financial assets to become credit-impaired.\n\n- \u00b7 Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:\n- \u00b7 Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or borrower;\n- \u00b7 Breach of contract such as default or a past due event;\n- \u00b7 For economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, the lenders of the borrower have granted the borrower concession/s that lenders would not otherwise consider. This would include forbearance actions (page 256);\n- \u00b7 Pending or actual bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation to avoid or delay discharge of the borrower's obligation/s;\n- \u00b7 The disappearance of an active market for the applicable financial asset due to financial difficulties of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses\n\nLending commitments to a credit-impaired obligor that have not yet been drawn down are included to the extent that the commitment cannot be withdrawn. Loss provisions against credit-impaired financial assets are determined based on an assessment of the recoverable cash flows under a range of scenarios, including the realisation of any collateral held where appropriate. The loss provisions held represent the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the instrument's original effective interest rate, and the gross carrying value (including contractual interest due but not paid) of the instrument prior to any credit impairment. The Group's definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default as set out in the UK's onshored capital requirements regulations (Art 178).\n\n## Expert credit judgement\n\nFor Corporate & Institutional, Commercial and Private Banking, borrowers are graded by credit risk management on a credit grading (CG) scale from CG1 to CG14. Once a borrower starts to exhibit credit deterioration, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classified as CG12 the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will continue to be managed by the business with support from the Stressed Assets Group for certain accounts.\n\nBorrowers graded CG12 exhibit well-defined weaknesses in areas such as management and/or performance but there is no current expectation of a loss of principal or interest. Where the impairment assessment indicates that there will be a loss of principal on a loan, the borrower is graded a CG14 while borrowers of other credit-impaired loans are graded CG13. Instruments graded CG13 or CG14 are regarded as stage 3.\n\nFor individually significant financial assets within stage 3, Stressed Asset Risk (SAR) will consider all judgements that have an impact on the expected future cash flows of the asset. These include: the business prospects, industry and geo political climate of the customer, quality of realisable value of collateral, the Group's legal position relative to other claimants and any renegotiation/ forbearance/ modification options. The future cash flow calculation involves significant judgements and estimates. As new information becomes available and further negotiations/ forbearance measures are taken the estimates of the future cash flows will be revised, and will have an impact on the future cash flow analysis.\n\nFor financial assets which are not individually significant, such as the Consumer Banking portfolio or small business loans, which comprise a large number of homogeneous loans that share similar characteristics, statistical estimates and techniques are used, as well as credit scoring analysis.\n\nConsumer and Business Banking clients are considered credit-impaired where they are more 90 days past due, or if the borrower files for bankruptcy or other forbearance programme, the borrower is deceased or the business is closed in the case of a small business, or if the borrower surrenders the collateral, or there is an identified fraud on the account. Additionally, if the account is unsecured and the borrower has other credit accounts with the Group that are considered credit-impaired, the account may be also be credit-impaired.\n\nTechniques used to compute impairment amounts use models which analyse historical repayment and default rates over a time horizon. Where various models are used, judgement is required to analyse the available information provided and select the appropriate model or combination of models to use.\n\nExpert credit judgement is also applied to determine whether any post-model adjustments are required for credit risk elements which are not captured by the models.\n\n## Modified financial instruments\n\nWhere the original contractual terms of a financial asset have been modified for credit reasons and the instrument has not been derecognised (an instrument is derecognised when a modification results in a change in cash flows that the Group would consider substantial), the resulting modification loss is recognised within credit impairment in the income statement with a corresponding decrease in the gross carrying value of the asset. If the modification involved a concession that the bank would not otherwise consider, the instrument is considered to be credit-impaired and is considered forborne.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impairment continued\n\nExpected credit loss for modified financial assets that have not been derecognised and are not considered to be creditimpaired will be recognised on a 12-month basis, or a lifetime basis, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. These assets are assessed (by comparison to the origination date) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk subsequent to the modification. Although loans may be modified for non-credit reasons, a significant increase in credit risk may occur. In addition to the recognition of modification gains and losses, the revised carrying value of modified financial assets will impact the calculation of expected credit losses, with any increase or decrease in expected credit loss recognised within impairment.\n\n## Forborne loans\n\nForborne loans are those loans that have been modified in response to a customer's financial difficulties. Forbearance strategies assist clients who are temporarily in financial distress and are unable to meet their original contractual repayment terms. Forbearance can be initiated by the client, the Group or a third-party including government sponsored programmes or a conglomerate of credit institutions. Forbearance may include debt restructuring such as new repayment schedules, payment deferrals, tenor extensions, interest only payments, lower interest rates, forgiveness of principal, interest or fees, or relaxation of loan covenants.\n\nForborne loans that have been modified (and not derecognised) on terms that are not consistent with those readily available in the market and/or where we have granted a concession compared to the original terms of the loans are considered credit-impaired if there is a detrimental impact on cash flows. The modification loss (see Classification and measurement - Modifications) is recognised in the profit or loss within credit impairment and the gross carrying value of the loan reduced by the same amount. The modified loan is disclosed as 'Loans subject to forbearance - credit-impaired'.\n\nLoans that have been subject to a forbearance modification, but which are not considered credit-impaired (not classified as CG13 or CG14), are disclosed as 'Forborne - not credit-impaired'. This may include amendments to covenants within the contractual terms.\n\n## Write-offs of credit-impaired instruments and reversal of impairment\n\nTo the extent a financial debt instrument is considered irrecoverable, the applicable portion of the gross carrying value is written off against the related loan provision. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed, it is decided that there is no realistic probability of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of the provision for credit impairment in the income statement.\n\n## Loss provisions on purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments (POCI)\n\nThe Group measures expected credit loss on a lifetime basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, expected credit loss is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Group recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the income statement and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime expected credit losses on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favourable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the income statement (and as impairment loss where the expected credit losses are greater).\n\n## Improvement in credit risk/curing\n\nA period may elapse from the point at which instruments enter lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 or stage 3) and are reclassified back to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). For financial assets that are credit-impaired (stage 3), a transfer to stage 2 or stage 1 is only permitted where the instrument is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. An instrument will no longer be considered credit-impaired when there is no shortfall of cash flows compared to the original contractual terms.\n\nFor financial assets within stage 2, these can only be transferred to stage 1 when they are no longer considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nWhere significant increase in credit risk was determined using quantitative measures, the instruments will automatically transfer back to stage 1 when the original PD based transfer criteria are no longer met. Where instruments were transferred to stage 2 due to an assessment of qualitative factors, the issues that led to the reclassification must be cured before the instruments can be reclassified to stage 1. This includes instances where management actions led to instruments being classified as stage 2, requiring that action to be resolved before loans are reclassified to stage 1.\n\nA forborne loan can only be removed from being disclosed as forborne if the loan is performing (stage 1 or 2) and a further two-year probation period is met.\n\nIn order for a forborne loan to become performing, the following criteria have to be satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 At least a year has passed with no default based upon the forborne contract terms\n- \u00b7 The customer is likely to repay its obligations in full without realising security\n- \u00b7 The customer has no accumulated impairment against amount outstanding (except for ECL)\n\nSubsequent to the criteria above, a further two-year probation period has to be fulfilled, whereby regular payments are made by the customer and none of the exposures to the customer are more than 30 days past due.",

Taxation\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIncome tax payable on profits is based on the applicable tax law in each jurisdiction and is recognised as an expense in the period in which profits arise.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Where permitted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the Group's tax charge for the year involves estimation and judgement, which includes an interpretation of local tax laws and an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken. These judgements take account of external advice where appropriate, and the Group's view on settling with the relevant tax authorities\n- \u00b7 The Group provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorities where an outflow is probable. In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorities will examine all the amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all relevant information\n- \u00b7 The recoverability of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availability of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be utilised. In preparing management forecasts the effect of applicable laws and regulations relevant to the utilisation of future taxable profits have been considered.",

Pillar Two of the Global anti-Base Erosion rules represents the first substantial overhaul of international tax rules in almost a century. It proposes four new taxing mechanisms under which multi-national enterprises would pay a minimum level of tax. An income inclusion rule, an under-taxed payment rule and a qualified domestic minimum top up tax together generally propose a minimum tax of 15% on income arising in each jurisdiction in which the multi-national enterprise operates. A subject to tax rule that is treaty-based generally proposes a minimum tax on certain cross-border intercompany transactions. Enactment is currently expected to occur with effect from 1 January 2024. The Group is closely monitoring developments to assess potential future implications and implementation efforts.\n\nTax rate: The tax charge for the year is higher than the charge at the rate of corporation tax in the UK, 19 per cent.

The recoverability of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availability of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be utilised.\n\nOf the Group's total deferred tax assets, $212 million relates to tax losses carried forward. These tax losses have arisen in individual legal entities and will be offset as future taxable profits arise in those entities.\n\n- \u00b7 $113 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Ireland, where there is no expiry date for unused tax losses. These losses relate to aircraft leasing and are expected to be fully utilised over the useful economical life of the assets being up to 18 years.\n- \u00b7 $51 million of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in the US. Management forecasts show that the losses are expected to be fully utilised over a period of two years.\n\nThe remaining deferred tax assets of $48 million relating to losses have arisen in other jurisdictions and are expected to be recovered in less than 10 years.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\n|                                                                                          | Net  2022  $million   | Gross  2022  $million   | Net  2021  $million   | Gross  2021  $million   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| No account has been taken of the following potential deferred tax  assets/(liabilities): |                       |                         |                       |                         |\n| Withholding tax on unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries  and associates        | (507)                 | (6,434)                 | (426)                 | (5,544)                 |\n| Tax losses                                                                               | 1,980                 | 8,231                   | 2,104                 | 8,292                   |\n| Held over gains on incorporation of overseas branches                                    | (346)                 | (1,313)                 | (422)                 | (1,476)                 |\n| Other temporary differences                                                              | 544                   | 1,991                   | 208                   | 790                     |",

Financial instruments\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as either amortised cost, or held at fair value through profit or loss. Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition of the instrument or, where applicable, at the time of reclassification.\n\n## Financial assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nDebt instruments held at amortised cost or held at FVOCI have contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) characteristics. Principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition but this may change over the life of the instrument as amounts are repaid. Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows have SPPI characteristics, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows\n- \u00b7 Leverage features\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms\n- \u00b7 Terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements);\n- \u00b7 Features that modify consideration of the time value of money - e.g. periodical reset of interest rates\n\nWhether financial assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depends on the objectives of the business models under which the assets are held. A business model refers to how the Group manages financial assets to generate cash flows.\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at the individual product business line, and where applicable within business lines depending on the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. Factors considered include:\n\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Group's management\n- \u00b7 How managers of the business model are compensated, including whether management is compensated based on the fair value of assets or the contractual cash flows collected\n- \u00b7 The risks that affect the performance of the business and how those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity\n\nThe Group's business model assessment is as follows:\n\n| Business model                      | Business objective                                                                                                                             | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Businesses                                                                                                         | Products                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hold to  collect                    | Intent is to originate  financial assets and  hold them to maturity,  collecting the  contractual cash flows  over the term of the  instrument | \u00b7  Providing financing and  originating assets to earn interest  income as primary income stream \u00b7  Performing credit risk  management activities \u00b7  Costs include funding costs,  transaction costs and                                                       | \u00b7  Corporate Lending \u00b7  Financial Markets \u00b7  Transaction Banking \u00b7  Retail Lending \u00b7  Treasury Markets  (Loans and | \u00b7  Loans and advances \u00b7  Debt securities                                                                         |\n| Hold to  collect   and sell         | Business objective met  through both hold to  collect and by selling  financial assets                                                         | \u00b7  Portfolios held for liquidity needs;  or where a certain interest yield  profile is maintained; or that are  normally rebalanced to achieve                                                                                                                 | \u00b7  Treasury Markets                                                                                                | \u00b7  Debt securities                                                                                               |\n| Fair value  through  profit or loss | All other business  objectives, including  trading and managing  financial assets on a fair  value basis                                       | changes, and impairment losses  \u00b7  Assets held for trading \u00b7  Assets that are originated,  purchased, and sold for profit  taking or underwriting activity \u00b7  Performance of the portfolio is  evaluated on a fair value basis \u00b7  Income streams are from fair | \u00b7  Financial Markets                                                                                               | \u00b7  Trading portfolios \u00b7  Financial Markets  reverse repos \u00b7  Financial Markets   (FM Bond and Loan  Syndication) |",

Financial instruments continued\n\nFinancial assets which have SPPI characteristics and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cashflows (hold to collect) are recorded at amortised cost. Conversely, financial assets which have SPPI characteristics but are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets (Hold to collect and sell) are classified as held at FVOCI. Both hold to collect and hold to collect and sell business models involve holding financial assets to collect the contractual cashflows. However, the business models are distinct by reference to the frequency and significance that asset sales play in meeting the objective under which a particular group of financial assets is managed. Hold to collect business models are characterised by asset sales that are incidental to meeting the objectives under which a group of assets is managed. Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can be made to manage increases in the credit risk of financial assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or insignificant. Cashflows from the sale of financial assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achieving the objectives under which a particular group of financial assets are managed. This may be the case where frequent sales of financial assets are required to manage the Group's daily liquidity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liquidity of financial instruments. Sales of assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more significant in value than those under the hold to collect model.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI\n\nNon-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at FVOCI on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Dividends received are recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these instruments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never reclassified to profit or loss even on derecognition.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets which are not held at amortised cost or that are not held at FVOCI are held at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are either mandatorily classified as fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.\n\n## Mandatorily classified at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities which are mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss are split between two subcategories as follows:\n\nTrading, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets and liabilities held for trading, which are those acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term\n- \u00b7 Derivatives\n\nNon-trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model (see the Group's business model assessment) which are not trading or derivatives\n- \u00b7 Hybrid financial assets that contain one or more embedded derivatives\n- \u00b7 Financial assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characteristics\n- \u00b7 Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities that constitute contingent consideration in a business combination\n\n## Designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis ('accounting mismatch').\n\nFinancial liabilities may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have an embedded derivative where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivative component.\n\n## Financial liabilities held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial liabilities that are not financial guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classified as financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial liabilities held at amortised cost.\n\nPreference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholder are classified as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds. The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financial guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are initially recognised at their fair value as a financial liability, and subsequently measured at the higher of the initial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provision. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held.\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at the date. The fair value of a liability includes the risk that the bank will not be able to honour its obligations.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual financial instrument. However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risk or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.\n\nThe fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If the market for a financial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, and held at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised on the trade date (the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). Loans and advances and other financial assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date (the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers).\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for financial assets and liabilities which are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition. However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on observable market data. In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement but is amortised or released to the income statement following the passage of time, or as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see Interest income and expense). Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere a financial instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship, its carrying value is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Financial assets held at FVOCI\n\nDebt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the profit or loss and are accumulated in equity. On derecognition, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On derecognition, the cumulative reserve is transferred to retained earnings and is not recycled to profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value, including contractual interest income or expense, recorded in the net trading income line in the profit or loss unless the instrument is part of a cash flow hedging relationship.",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are held at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the net trading income line in the profit or loss, other than that attributable to changes in credit risk. Fair value changes attributable to credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a separate category of reserves unless this is expected to create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, in which case the entire change in fair value of the financial liability designated at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement.\n\nWhere financial assets have been modified, the modified terms are assessed on a qualitative and quantitative basis to determine whether a fundamental change in the nature of the instrument has occurred, such as whether the derecognition of the pre-existing instrument and the recognition of a new instrument is appropriate.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss except for equity instruments elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished. A financial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, where a financial liability has been modified, it is derecognised if the difference between the modified cash flows and the original cash flows is more than 10 per cent, or if less than 10 per cent, the Group will perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the terms of the two instruments are substantially different.\n\nIf the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in 'Other income' except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in other comprehensive income which are never recycled to the profit or loss.\n\n## Modified financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities whose original contractual terms have been modified, including those loans subject to forbearance strategies, are considered to be modified instruments. Modifications may include changes to the tenor, cash flows and or interest rates among other factors.\n\nWhere derecognition of financial assets is appropriate (see Derecognition), the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated Credit-Impaired assets (POCI).\n\nWhere derecognition is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (or credit adjusted effective interest rate for POCI financial assets). The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modified gross carrying values of the instruments are recorded as a modification gain or loss in the profit or loss.\n\nGains and losses arising from modifications for credit reasons are recorded as part of 'Credit Impairment' (see Credit Impairment policy). Modification gains and losses arising from non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of 'Credit Impairment' or within income depending on whether there has been a change in the credit risk on the financial asset subsequent to the modification. Modification gains and losses arising on financial liabilities are recognised within income. The movements in the applicable expected credit loss loan positions are disclosed in further detail in Risk Review.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9, changes to the basis for determining contractual cash flows as a direct result of interest rate benchmark reform are treated as changes to a floating interest rate to that instrument, provided that the transition from the IBOR benchmark rate to the alternative RFR takes place on an economically equivalent basis. Where the instrument is measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, this results in a change in the instrument's effective interest rate, with no change in the amortised cost value of the instrument. If the change to the instrument does not meet these criteria, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the changes are substantial and if they are, the financial instrument is derecognised and a new financial instrument is recognised. If the changes are not substantial, the Group adjusts the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument by the present value of the changes not covered by the practical expedient, discounted using the revised effective interest rate.",

Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model.\n\nFinancial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated. Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.\n\n## Reclassified from amortised cost\n\nWhere financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nFor financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to fair value through other comprehensive income, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in other comprehensive income. Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from loan loss provisions to a separate reserve in other comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.\n\n## Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nWhere financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the profit or loss.\n\nFor financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost. In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within other comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.\n\n## Reclassified from fair value through profit or loss\n\nWhere financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification is used to determine the effective interest rate on the financial asset going forward. In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses. Where financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.",

Since then, there have been further updates, particularly with respect to the cessation date for certain USD LIBOR tenors being deferred from 31 December 2021 to 30 June 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n## How the Group is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates\n\nIn 2018, the Group established its IBOR Transition Programme to manage the transition away from LIBOR. Senior management oversight for the Programme is provided by the Chief Executive Officers of CCIB and CPBB. The Programme's strategic bankwide approach aims to support clients throughout the transition, while ensuring key risks and issues are identified and effectively managed. The Programme is governed by a principal Programme Steering Committee that oversees 13 workstreams aligned to the Group's businesses and functions. Within the Programme, separate committees govern each workstream, and all of them have a dedicated Accountable Executive.\n\nAdditional governance is supported by regular updates provided to senior risk committees, including the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Risk Committee.\n\nFrom an industry and regulatory perspective, the Group actively participates in and contributes to working groups, industry associations and business forums that focus on different aspects of the transition. The Group monitors the developments at these forums and includes significant decisions into its broader transition plans.\n\n## Progress during 2022\n\nSupported by a number of system enhancements, the Group has successfully enabled the transition to RFR products, with end-to-end capabilities across a full suite of derivative and cash products. Activity in products referencing RFRs continued to grow throughout 2022. New use of USD LIBOR has ceased, except for limited exceptions as permitted by the regulators.\n\nThe Group remediated all non-USD LIBOR exposures by early 2022 and has no reliance on synthetic GBP or JPY LIBOR in 2022. During 2022, focus shifted on the remediation of legacy USD LIBOR transactions and automation of associated data and processes. Clients with legacy USD LIBOR loans have been engaged to remediate their contracts primarily via active conversion to alternative rates, or other suitable transition mechanisms such as the inclusion of robust fallbacks. The Group adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all its trading entities and continued to engage clients that had not adhered to negotiate remediation of USD LIBOR contracts by the end of June 2023. The Group will also participate in the conversion events at the London Clearing House (LCH) during the first part of 2023.\n\nFrontline and client engagement, including internal and client communications, training, and client webinars were a key feature of the Programme throughout 2022 to support transition from USD LIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as well as the transition for other IBOR benchmarks that are ceasing.\n\n## Risks which the Group is exposed to due to IBOR transition\n\nThe Group has largely mitigated all material adverse outcomes associated with the cessation of IBOR benchmarks, and these have not required a change to the Group's risk management strategy. However, the Group will continue to focus on the remediation required for other benchmarks, and will continue to monitor and manage the inherent risks of the transition, with particular attention being paid to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal Risk: IBOR transition introduces significant legal risks and the Group has taken action to mitigate them where possible. These include risks around contracts that reference USD LIBOR. Steps have been taken to either insert robust fallbacks or actively convert transactions from the relevant IBOR to the new RFR-based options. The Group actively monitors remediation progress and tracks exposures that are proving difficult to remediate.  Based on the information available as at the date of this Report, there is a reasonable probability that some such exposures may not be remediated by the first interest fixing date following June 30 2023.  The Group will apply certain legislative solutions to these exposures if required, including the application of synthetic USD LIBOR, should it be made available\n- \u00b7 Conduct Risk: The Group considers Conduct Risk to be a significant area of non-financial risk management throughout the transition. Our risk appetite statement on Conduct Risk strives to maintain appropriate outcomes by continuously demonstrating that we are 'Doing the Right Thing' in the way we do business. Accordingly, we recognise that the identification and mitigation of conduct risks arising in respect of the transition are fundamental to the successful transition to new RFR-based rates. The Group has therefore taken actions in this regard as an integral part of its IBOR Transition Programme, including an extensive outreach programme\n- \u00b7 Operational Risk: The Group has recognised the importance of the ongoing identification and management of Operational Risk as a result of IBOR transition, including those related to systems affected by the transition. The Programme has adopted the Group's existing Operational Risk Framework in its approach to identifying, quantifying, and mitigating the impact of operational risks resulting from the transition\n- \u00b7 Market Risk: As trades are transitioned from IBOR to RFRs, the business-as-usual metrics, limit structure and controls will continue to apply. Limits for value at risk and market risk sensitivities are in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Statement. New limits have been set following engagement with the business to consider client demand and market liquidity in RFR-linked products, as well as the regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 Financial and pricing risk: The Group continues to monitor any financial impact of IBOR transition across business and functional workstreams in the Programme, and is implementing model and pricing changes to mitigate these risks and ensure alignment with conventions and pricing mechanisms of the alternative reference rates and indices\n- \u00b7 Accounting Risk: The Group has identified the financial instruments that may be affected by accounting issues such as accounting for contractual changes due to IBOR reform, fair value measurement and hedge accounting. We continue to monitor and contribute to industry developments on tax and accounting changes.",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nIn practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out below. Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.\n\nIn addition, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default. Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges (legally sells) and obtains (legally purchases) respectively, highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.\n\nThe following tables set out the impact of netting on the balance sheet. This comprises derivative transactions settled through an enforceable netting agreement where we have the intent and ability to settle net and which are offset on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                                                  | 2022                                            | 2022                      | 2022                                      | 2022                                             | 2022                                             | 2022                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                  | Gross amounts                                   | Impact of   offset in the | Net amounts    of financial  instruments  | Related amount not offset   in the balance sheet | Related amount not offset   in the balance sheet |                      |\n|                                                                  | of recognised  financial  instruments  $million | balance sheet  $million   | presented in the  balance sheet  $million | Financial  instruments  $million                 | Financial  collateral  $million                  | Net amount  $million |\n| Assets                                                           |                                                 |                           |                                           |                                                  |                                                  |                      |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                 | 120,799                                         | (57,082)                  | 63,717                                    | (50,133)                                         | (9,206)                                          | 4,378                |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements and  other similar secured lending | 105,891                                         | (15,924)                  | 89,967                                    | -

A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.\n\nThe Valuation Methodology function is responsible for independent price verification, oversight of fair value and appropriate value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues. Independent price verification is the process of determining that the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product. The Valuation Methodology function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financial instruments are priced to exit. These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements. The market data used for price verification(PV) may include data sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers. The Valuation Methodology function perform an ongoing review of the market data sources that are used as part of the PV and fair value processes which are formally documented on a semi-annual basis detailing the suitability of the market data used for price testing. Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.\n\nThe Valuation and Benchmarks Committee (VBC) is the valuation governance forum consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Methodology and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory. For Principal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group evaluates the significance of financial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial instruments is determined using valuation techniques and estimates (see below) which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financial instruments\n- \u00b7 When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in determining the fair value (page 383])\n- \u00b7 In determining the valuation of financial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the significant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments (page 390)\n- \u00b7 Where the estimated measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a significant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nRefer to the fair value hierarchy explanation - Level 1, 2 and 3 (page 385)\n\n## \u00b7 Financial instruments held at fair value\n\n- -Debt securities - asset-backed securities: Asset-backed securities are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers' quotes, etc. Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classified as Level 2. In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classified as Level 3. The fair value of Level 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings\n- -Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group. Where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classified as Level 2. Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classified as Level 3. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxies from comparable issuers or assets\n- -Derivatives: Derivative products are classified as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources. Derivative products are classified as Level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable. Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts. In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be implied from the market, and methods such as historical analysis and comparison with historical levels or other benchmark data must be employed\n- -Equity shares - private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/EBITDA) ratios - of comparable listed companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. To ensure comparability between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied (for example, liquidity and size) in the valuation. In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternative valuation techniques (for example, discounted cash flow model or net asset value ('NAV')or option pricing model), which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter (OTC) prices) are classified as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash flow method is applied\n- -Loans and advances: These primarily include loans in the FM Bond and Loan Syndication business which were not fully syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other financing transactions within Financial Markets, and loans and advances including reverse repurchase agreements that do not have SPPI cashflows or are managed on a fair value basis. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on observable clean sales transactions prices or market observable spreads. If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparables with similar credit grade, sector and region, are used. Where observable transaction prices, credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classified as Level 2. Where there are no recent transactions or comparables, these loans are classified as Level 3\n- -Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classified as Level 2 and valued using such quotes. Where there are significant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classified as Level 3. The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxied from comparable issuers or assets\n\n## \u00b7 Financial instruments held at amortised cost\n\nThe following sets out the Group's basis for establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classification between Levels 1, 2 and 3. As certain categories of financial instruments are not actively traded, there is a significant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values:\n\n- -Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts\n- -Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices. For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity\n- -Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar Credit Risk and remaining maturity",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n- -Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value. Where available, securities are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related underlying (for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer) or input proxies from a different underlying (for example, a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating). Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs. This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset-backed securities. The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows\n- -Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar Credit Risk and remaining maturity. The Group's loans and advances to customers' portfolio is well diversified by geography and industry. Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices within one month, and approximately half re-prices within 12 months. Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment. The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and Credit Risk. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value. The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quantification of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical\n- -Other assets: Other assets comprise primarily of cash collateral and trades pending settlement. The carrying amount of these financial instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value as they are either short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWhen establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument. The main valuation adjustments (described further below) in determining fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows:\n\n|                                | 01.01.22  $million   | Movement  during the year  $million   | 31.12.22  $million   | 01.01.21  $million   | Movement  during the year  $million   | 31.12.21  $million   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Bid-offer valuation adjustment | 101                  | 17                                    | 118                  | 103                  | (2)                                   | 101                  |\n| Credit valuation adjustment    | 165                  | 6                                     | 171                  | 189                  | (24)                                  | 165                  |\n| Debit valuation adjustment     | (70)                 | (42)                                  | (112)                | (55)                 | (15)                                  | (70)                 |\n| Model valuation adjustment     | 5                    | (2)                                   | 3                    | 5                    | -                                     | 5                    |\n| Funding valuation adjustment   | -                    | 46                                    | 46                   | 5                    | (5)                                   | -                    |\n| Other fair value adjustments   | 20                   | 3                                     | 23                   | 32                   | (12)                                  | 20                   |\n| Total                          | 221                  | 28                                    | 249                  | 279                  | (58)                                  | 221                  |\n| Income deferrals               |                      |                                       |                      |                      |                                       |                      |\n| Day 1 and other deferrals      | 147                  | 39                                    | 186                  | 138                  | 9                                     | 147                  |\n| Total                          | 147                  | 39                                    | 186                  | 138                  | 9                                     | 147                  |\n\nNote: Bracket represents an asset and credit to the income statement\n\n- \u00b7 Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Generally, market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, and a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business' positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems\n- \u00b7 Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): The Group accounts for CVA against the fair value of derivative products. CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions. It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price to acquire our exposures. CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold. The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future positive exposure, market-implied probability of default (PD) and recovery rates. Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD. Wrongway risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for key wrong-way exposures. The Group also captures the uncertainties associated with wrong-way risk in the Group's Prudential Valuation Adjustments framework",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Debit valuation adjustment (DVA): The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivative liabilities to reflect changes in its own credit standing. The Group's DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. For derivative liabilities, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Group's probability of default to the Group's negative expected exposure against the counterparty. The Group's probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond and CDS spreads associated with the Group's issuances and market standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on the simulation of the underlying risk factors over the expected life of the deal. This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements\n- \u00b7 Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment. These pricing deficiencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model\n- \u00b7 Funding valuation adjustment (FVA): The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products, including embedded derivatives. FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs or benefits that could arise in relation to the exposure. FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding. The FVA for uncollateralised (including partially collateralised) derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions\n- \u00b7 Other fair value adjustments: The Group calculates the fair value on the interest rate callable products by calibrating to a set of market prices with differing maturity, expiry and strike of the trades\n- \u00b7 Day one and other deferrals: In certain circumstances the initial fair value is based on a valuation technique which differs to the transaction price at the time of initial recognition. However, these gains can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primarily on observable market data. In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement. The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated. Other deferrals primarily represent adjustments taken to reflect the specific terms and conditions of certain derivative contracts which affect the termination value at the measurement date\n\nIn addition, the Group calculates own credit adjustment (OCA) on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes, in order to reflect changes in its own credit standing. Issued debt is discounted utilising the spread at which similar instruments would be issued or bought back at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset. OCA measures the difference between the fair value of issued debt as of reporting date and theoretical fair values of issued debt adjusted up or down for changes in own credit spreads from inception date to the measurement date. Under IFRS 9 the change in the OCA component is reported under other comprehensive income. The Group's OCA reserve will increase if its credit standing worsens in comparison to the inception of the trade and, conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. The Group's OCA reserve will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Group implemented refinements to its methodology for the valuation of structured notes, to align with evolving market practice. Previously, the structured note spread was split into a market level of funding component (recorded in the Consolidated income statement) and an idiosyncratic own credit component (recorded in the Consolidated statement of other comprehensive income). The refinement is to record all prospective movements in the spreads over the benchmark rate of the host debt instrument through Other Comprehensive income, as changes to the funding component are considered to be integral to the issuer's own credit risk. The funding valuation adjustment in relation to the embedded derivative component of the structured notes will continue to be recorded in the Consolidated income statement.\n\nThe impact of this change in estimate, which took effect prospectively from 1 October 2022, was a loss of $13 million recorded in the Consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, which would have been recorded in the Consolidated income statement under the previous methodology. The revised approach is expected to result in a more consistent own credit valuation with peer banks. The net life-to-date gains previously recorded in the Consolidated income statement of $219 million from inception of the structured notes to the effective date of this change in estimate in relation to the market level of funding for the host debt instrument are expected to reverse in the Group's Consolidated statement of other comprehensive income as the existing portfolio matures, unless the structured notes are redeemed or otherwise derecognised earlier.. This net lifeto-date gain of $220 million includes a gain of $244 million recorded in the Consolidated income statement for 2022 (2021: $33 million gain).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy - financial instruments held at fair value\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a significant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where inputs which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation are not based on observable market data",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Level 3 Summary and significant unobservable inputs continued\n\nThe following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the valuation technique table:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable price/yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices. Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash flow model. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the instrument. The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financial instruments such as maturity and/or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument (for example, deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond). An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset. An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset\n- \u00b7 Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates\n- \u00b7 Credit spread represents the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the Credit Risk of an instrument\n- \u00b7 Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash flows into present value\n- \u00b7 Equity-FX correlation is the correlation between equity instrument and foreign exchange instrument\n- \u00b7 EV/EBITDA multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents. An increase in EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 EV/Revenue multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue. An increase in EV/Revenue multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange curves is the term structure for forward rates and swap rates between currency pairs over a specified period\n- \u00b7 Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an entity's assets after deducting any liabilities\n- \u00b7 Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments are primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted firms' investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase in liquidity discount will result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Earnings (P/E) multiple is the ratio of the market value of the equity to the net income after tax. An increase in P/E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Book (P/B) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity. An increase in P/B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Sales (P/S) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales. An increase in P/S multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Recovery rate is the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan. As the probability of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default. An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan\n- \u00b7 Repo curve is the term structure of repo rates on repos and reverse repos at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Generally, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Sensitivities in respect of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities\n\nSensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs. The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The percentage shift is determined by statistical analysis performed on a set of reference prices based on the composition of the Group's Level 3 inventory as the measurement date. Favourable and unfavourable changes (which show the balance adjusted for input change) are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters. The Level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.\n\n|                                                                  | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Fair value through other comprehensive income Favourable  Unfavourable   | Fair value through other comprehensive income Favourable  Unfavourable   | Fair value through other comprehensive income Favourable  Unfavourable   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                  | Net exposure  $million                      | Favourable  changes  $million               | Unfavourable  changes  $million             | Net exposure  $million                                                   | changes  $million                                                        | changes  $million                                                        |\n| Financial instruments held at fair value                         |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                                                          |                                                                          |                                                                          |\n| Loans and advances                                               | 1,826                                       | 1,851                                       | 1,758                                       | -

Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instrument prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit rating or credit index and indices. Derivatives are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in profit or loss (except where cash flow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised within other comprehensive income).\n\nFair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. Where the initially recognised fair value of a derivative contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same initial recognition accounting policy as for other financial assets and liabilities. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the Group may designate a recognised asset or liability, a firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment of a foreign operation into a formal hedge accounting relationship with a derivative that has been entered to manage interest rate and/or foreign exchange risks present in the hedged item. The Group applies the 'Phase 1' hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the 'Phase 2' amendments to IFRS in respect of interest rate benchmark reform. There are three categories of hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedge: to manage the fair value of interest rate and/or foreign currency risks of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge: to manage interest rate or foreign exchange risk of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction\n- \u00b7 Net investment hedge: to manage the structural foreign exchange risk of an investment in a foreign operation\n\nThe Group formally documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This is described in more detail in the categories of hedges below.\n\nThe Group assesses, both at hedge inception and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives designated in hedge relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Hedges are considered to be highly effective if all the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 At inception of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is prospectively expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\n- \u00b7 Prospective and retrospective effectiveness should be with a range of 80-125%. This is tested using regression analysis\n- \u00b7 The regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression, is at least 80%\n- \u00b7 In the case of the hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probability of occurring and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that are expected to affect reported profit or loss. The Group assumes that any interest rate benchmarks on which hedged item cash flows are based are not altered by IBOR reform\n\nThe Group discontinues hedge accounting in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument has expired, is sold, terminated, or exercised\n- \u00b7 The hedged item matures, is sold, or repaid\n- \u00b7 The forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable\n- \u00b7 The Group elects to discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, if the actual result of a hedge is outside the 80-125% range, but the hedge passes the prospective assessment, then the Group will not de-designate the hedge relationship.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39, the Group may change hedge designations and corresponding documentation without the hedge being discontinued where there is a change in interest rate benchmark of the hedged item, hedging instrument or designated hedged risk. Permitted changes include the right to:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefine the description of the hedged item and/or hedging instrument\n- \u00b7 Redefine the hedged risk to reference an alternative risk-free rate\n- \u00b7 Change the method for assessing hedge effectiveness due to modifications required by IBOR reform\n- \u00b7 Elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes in the assessment of retrospective hedge effectiveness to zero\n\nA hedge designation may be modified more than once, each time a relationship is affected as a direct result of IBOR reform.",

Derivative financial instruments continued\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in net trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the remaining term to maturity of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment attributable to the hedged risk is included in net trading income to match the hedging derivative.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are initially recognised in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. These amounts are subsequently recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Both the derivative fair value movement and any recycled amount are recorded in the 'Cashflow hedges' line item in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method, which creates a derivative instrument to serve as a proxy for the hedged transaction. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the critical terms of the hedged item and it has a fair value of zero at inception. The hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative are regressed to establish the statistical significance of the hedge relationship. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the net trading income immediately.\n\nIf a cash flow hedge is discontinued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is released to the income statement as and when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, the Group will retain the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve for designated cash flow hedges even though there is uncertainty arising from these reforms with respect to the timing and amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than IBOR reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges, with gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges recorded in the line 'Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations' in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the translation reserve within equity. These amounts remain in equity until the net investment is disposed of. The ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised in the net trading income immediately.\n\nThe tables below analyse the notional principal amounts and the positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments.

The Group also holds various fixed rate debt securities such as government and corporate bonds, including some denominated in foreign currency (see Note 13). These assets and liabilities held are exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest and foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets, or exchange fixed rates on assets to match floating rates paid on funding. The Group further uses cross currency swaps to match the currency of the issued debt or held asset with that of the entity's functional currency.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness from fair value hedges is driven by cross currency basis risk. The amortisation of fair value hedge adjustments for hedged items no longer designated is recognised in net trading income. In future periods hedge relationships linked to an interest rate benchmark deemed in scope of benchmark reform may experience ineffectiveness due to market participants' expectations for when the change from the existing IBOR benchmark to an alternative risk-free rate will occur, since the transition may occur at different times for the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the Group held the following interest rate and cross currency swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and currency risk.",

The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults.\n\nThe hedging strategy of the Group involves using interest rate swaps to manage the variability in future cash flows on assets and liabilities that have floating rates of interest by exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates. It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variability in future exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies. This is done on both a micro basis whereby a single interest rate or cross currency swap is designated in a separate relationship with a single hedged item (such as a floating rate loan to a customer), and on a portfolio basis whereby each hedging instrument is designated against a group of hedged items that share the same risk (such as a group of customer accounts).\n\nThe hedged risk is determined as the variability of future cash flows arising from changes in the designated benchmark interest rate.\n\n## Hedging instruments and ineffectiveness\n\n|                                   | 2022               | 2022            | 2022                | 2022                                                      | 2022                          | 2022                                               |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   |                    | Carrying amount | Carrying amount     | Change in fair                                            | (Loss)/gain                   | Ineffectiveness  (loss) recognised  in net trading |\n|                                   | Notional  $million | Asset  $million | Liability  $million | value used to  calculate hedge  ineffectiveness\u00b9 $million | recognised   in OCI  $million | income  $million                                   |\n| Interest rate risk                |                    |                 |                     |                                                           |                               |                                                    |\n| Interest rate swaps               | 31,977             | 100             | 671                 | (533)                                                     | (531)                         | (2)                                                |\n| Currency risk                     |                    |                 |                     |                                                           |                               |                                                    |\n| Forward foreign exchange contract | 11,987             | 99              | 385                 | (141)                                                     | (1 41)                        | -

This risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Group's presentation currency, which causes the value of the investment to vary.\n\nThe Group's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory ratios of the Group and its banking subsidiaries. The Group uses foreign exchange forwards to manage the effect of exchange rates on its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.",

Derivative financial instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group applies the Phase 1 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7' which allow the Group to assume that the interest rate benchmark on which cash flows for the hedged item and/or hedging instrument are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform for the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Prospective hedge assessment\n- \u00b7 Determining whether a cash flow or forecast transaction for a cash flow hedge is highly probable. However, the Group otherwise assesses whether the cash flows are considered highly probable\n- \u00b7 Determining when cumulative balances in the cash flow hedge reserve from de-designated hedges should be recycled to the income statement\n\nThe Group will not de-designate a hedge relationship of a benchmark in scope of IBOR reform if the retrospective hedge result is outside the required 80-125% range but, the hedge passes the prospective assessment. Any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in net trading income.\n\nFor hedges of non-contractually specified benchmark portions of an interest rate (such as fair value hedges of interest rate risk on fixed rate debt instruments) the Group only assesses whether the designated benchmark is separately identifiable at hedge inception. The choice of designated benchmark is not revisited for existing hedge relationships\n\nIn applying these amendments, the Group has made the following key assumptions for the period end, to be reviewed on an ongoing basis:\n\n- \u00b7 The interest rate benchmarks applicable to the Group that are in scope of the IFRS amendments are all LIBORs, EONIA, Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SGD SOR) and Thai Baht Interest Rate Fixing (THB FIX)\n- \u00b7 EURIBOR is not in scope of the IFRS amendments because its revised methodology incorporates market transaction data, hence the benchmark is expected to continue to exist in future reporting periods\n\nThe Group assumes that the uncertainty arising from USD LIBOR will be present until 30 June 2023, at which time the amendments to IFRS no longer apply.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the following notional principal amounts of derivative instruments designated in fair value or cash flow hedge accounting relationships were linked to IBOR reference rates:\n\n|                                                                                            | Fair value   hedges  $million   | Cash flow   hedges  $million   | Total  $million   | Weighted  average  exposure  Years   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps                                                                        |                                 |                                |                   |                                      |\n| USD LIBOR                                                                                  | 35,989                          | 24,090                         | 60,079            | 2.2                                  |\n| GBP LIBOR                                                                                  | -

Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group purchases securities (a reverse repurchase agreement - 'reverse repo') typically with financial institutions subject to a commitment to resell or return the securities at a predetermined price. These securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, however they are recorded off-balance sheet as collateral received. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost unless it is managed on a fair value basis or designated at fair value through profit or loss. In majority of cases through the contractual terms of a reverse repo arrangement, the Group as the transferee of the security collateral has the right to sell or repledge the asset concerned.\n\nThe Group also sells securities (a repurchase agreement - 'repo') subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a predetermined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and these securities are disclosed as pledged collateral. Consideration received (or cash collateral received) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost unless it is either mandatorily classified as fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.\n\nFinancial assets are pledged as collateral as part of sales and repurchases, securities borrowing and securitisation transactions under terms that are usual and customary for such activities. The Group is obliged to return equivalent securities.\n\nRepo and reverse repo transactions typically entitle the Group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets similar to those provided as collateral in the event of a default. Securities sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or through a securities sale and Total Return Swap (TRS) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially the associated risks and rewards of the securities (the TRS is not recognised). The counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate. Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge these to obtain funding.",

        "page_content": "## 17. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in Investments in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill included in intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Detailed calculations are performed based on forecasting expected cash flows of the relevant cash generating units (CGUs) and discounting these at an appropriate discount rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generate separate cash inflows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. These are equal to or smaller than the Group's reportable segments (as set out in Note 2) as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis. The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table (page 410).\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is based on the application of judgements including the basis of goodwill impairment calculation assumptions. Judgement is also applied in determination of CGUs.\n\nEstimates include forecasts used for determining cash flows for CGUs, the appropriate long-term growth rates to use and discount rates which factor in country risk-free rates and applicable risk premiums. The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement and is subject to potential change over time.\n\n## Acquired intangibles\n\nAt the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identifiable assets acquired. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value, which reflects market expectations of the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives (4 to 16 years). At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immediately to the recoverable amount.\n\n## Computer software\n\nAcquired computer software licences are capitalised if the principles of development are met on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.\n\nInternally generated software represents substantially all of the total software capitalised. Direct costs of the development of separately identifiable internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow from its use. These costs include staff remuneration costs such as salaries, statutory payments and share-based payments, materials, service providers and contractors provided their time is directly attributable to the software build. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately when incurred. Internally generated software is amortised over each asset's useful life to a maximum of 10-years. On an annual basis software assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, including assessing for indicators of impairment. Indicators of impairment include loss of business relevance, obsolescence, exit of the business to which the software relates, technological changes, change in use of the asset, reduction in useful life, plans to reduce usage or scope.\n\nFor capitalised software, judgement is required to determine which costs relate to research (expensed) and which costs relate to development (capitalised). Further judgement is required to determine the technical feasibility of completing the software such that it will be available for use. Estimates are used to determine how the software will generate probable future economic benefits: these estimates include cost savings, income increases, balance sheet improvements, improved functionality or improved asset safeguarding.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a contractual arrangement that conveys the right to receive access to the supplier's software application over the contract term. As such, the Group does not have control and as a result recognises an operating expense for these costs over the contract term. Certain costs related to implementation of the SaaS may meet the definition of an intangible asset in their own right if it is separately identifiable and control is established. These costs are capitalised if it is expected to provide the Group with future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and the Group can restrict others from accessing those benefits.",

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Indicators of impairment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region including geopolitical changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decisions to exit certain regions. The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value in use (VIU). The calculation of VIU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cashflow projections and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five. The cashflow projections are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2027. The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cashflows using long-term GDP growth rates. All cashflows are discounted using discount rates which reflect market rates appropriate to the CGU. Post-tax discount rates are used to calculate the VIU using the post-tax cashflows. The post-tax discount rate is subsequently grossed up to pre-tax discount rate. The calculated VIU using post-tax and pre-tax discount rate is same.\n\nThe goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill.\n\n|                                                 | 2022               | 2022                               | 2022                                            | 2021               | 2021                               | 2021                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash generating unit                            | Goodwill  $million | Pre Tax   discount rates  per cent | Long-term  forecast GDP  growth rates  per cent | Goodwill  $million | Pre Tax   discount rates  per cent | Long-term  forecast GDP  growth rates  per cent |\n| Country CGUs                                    |                    |                                    |                                                 |                    |                                    |                                                 |\n| Asia                                            | 1,032              |                                    |                                                 | 1,073              |                                    |                                                 |\n| Hong Kong                                       | 357                | 12.4                               | 1.7                                             | 357                | 10.6                               | 2.5                                             |\n| Taiwan                                          | 333                | 11.3                               | 1.7                                             | 361                | 10.4                               | 2.0                                             |\n| Singapore                                       | 342                | 12.3                               | 2.3                                             | 341                | 11.6                               | 2.4                                             |\n| Bangladesh                                      | -                  | 24.3                               | 5.4                                             | 14                 | 15.0                               | 7. 3                                            |\n| Africa & Middle East                            | 85                 |                                    |                                                 | 92                 |                                    |                                                 |\n| Pakistan                                        | 36                 | 30.9                               | 5.9                                             | 43                 | 22.2                               | 6.0                                             |\n| Bahrain                                         | 49                 | 16.6                               | 0.7                                             | 49                 | 13.1                               | 3.0                                             |\n| Global CGUs                                     | 1,354              |                                    |                                                 | 1,430              |                                    |                                                 |\n| Global Private Banking                          | 83                 | 14.5                               | 2.0                                             | 84                 | 12.4                               | 2.5                                             |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 1,271              | 14.7                               | 2.5                                             | 1,346              | 12.5                               | 3.0                                             |\n|                                                 | 2,471              |                                    |                                                 | 2,595              |                                    |                                                 |\n\nBangladesh has had all the goodwill allocated to them written off, totalling $14 million.

Hong Kong CGU is considered sensitive to the key variables and any individual movements on the estimates (cashflow, discount rate and GDP growth rate) up to the levels disclosed below would eliminate the current headroom.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table above represents reasonably possible scenarios that could occur if either; economic factors (which drive GDP rates and discount rates); country-specific cash flows; or a combination of both are different from the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment at 31 December 2022.\n\nFor there to be no headroom, the discount rate will need to increase by 1.57 per cent. Similarly, the GDP rates will need to decrease by 2.35 per cent and cashflows would need to decrease by 10.89 per cent.\n\n## Acquired intangibles\n\nThese primarily comprise those items recognised as part of the acquisitions of Union Bank (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited), Hsinchu (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan) Limited), Pembroke, American Express Bank and ABSA's custody business in Africa. Maintenance intangible assets represent the difference in the value between the contractual right under acquired leases to receive aircraft in a specified maintenance condition at the end of the lease and the actual physical condition of the aircraft at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe acquired intangibles are amortised over periods from four years to a maximum of 16 years.

        "page_content": "## 18. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAll property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nAt each balance sheet date the assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, including assessing for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are included in the income statement.\n\nRepairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nLand and buildings comprise mainly branches and offices. Freehold land is not depreciated although it is subject to impairment testing.\n\nDepreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Owned premises\n- \u00b7 up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Leasehold premises\n- \u00b7 up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements\n- \u00b7 shorter of remaining lease term and 10 years\n- \u00b7 Equipment and motor vehicles\n- \u00b7 three to 15 years\n- \u00b7 Aircraft\n- \u00b7 up to 18 years\n- \u00b7 Ships\n- \u00b7 up to 15 years\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee of a right-of-use asset, the leased assets are capitalised and included in Property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liability to the lessor recognised in Other liabilities, in accordance with the Group's leased assets accounting policy in Note 19.\n\nAll other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's aircraft leasing portfolio is based on the application of judgement and estimates to determine the most appropriate recoverable amount for each aircraft when assessing for impairment. Estimates involve the appropriate cash flows, discount rates and residual values used in determining a value-in-use for aircraft, and judgement is required in determining the appropriate observable third-party valuations to use for assessing current market value.\n\n|                                                             | 2022               | 2022                | 2022                               | 2022                                 | 2022                                | 2022            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                             | Premises  $million | Equipment  $million | Operating   lease assets  $million | Leased   premises   assets  $million | Leased  equipment  assets  $million | Total  $million |\n| Cost or valuation                                           |                    |                     |                                    |                                      |                                     |                 |\n| At 1 January                                                | 1,980              | 901                 | 4,248                              | 1,854                                | 33                                  | 9,016           |\n| Exchange translation differences                            | (90)               | (65)                | -                                  | (111)                                | (4)                                 | (270)           |\n| Additions 1                                                 | 87                 | 124                 | 624                                | 339                                  | 1                                   | 1,175           |\n| Disposals and fully depreciated assets  written off 2       | (142)              | (102)               | (452)                              | (425)                                | (1)                                 | (1,122)         |\n| Transfers to assets held for sale                           | (62)               | (18)                | -                                  | (5)                                  | -                                   | (85)            |\n| As at 31 December                                           | 1,773              | 840                 | 4,420                              | 1,652                                | 29                                  | 8,714           |\n| Depreciation                                                |                    |                     |                                    |                                      |                                     |                 |\n| Accumulated at 1 January                                    | 795                | 611                 | 1,155                              | 819                                  | 20                                  | 3,400           |\n| Exchange translation differences                            | (39)               | (39)                | -                                  | (33)                                 | (3)                                 | (114)           |\n| Charge for the year                                         | 76                 | 116                 | 202                                | 250                                  | 7                                   | 651             |\n| Impairment charge                                           | 1                  | -                   | 40                                 | 9                                    | -                                   | 50              |\n| Attributable to assets sold, transferred   or written off 2 | (125)              | (101)               | (212)                              | (313)                                | -                                   | (751)           |\n| Transfers to assets held for sale                           | (30)               | (12)                | -                                  | (2)                                  | -                                   | (44)            |\n| Accumulated at 31 December                                  | 678                | 575                 | 1,185                              | 730                                  | 24                                  | 3,192           |\n| Net book amount at 31 December                              | 1,095              | 265                 | 3,235                              | 922                                  | 5                                   | 5,522           |",

The leases are classified as operating leases as they do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets, and rental income from operating lease assets is disclosed in Note 6. At 31 December 2022, these assets had a net book value of $3,235 million (31 December 2021: $3,093 million).\n\nUnder these leases the lessee is responsible for the maintenance and servicing of the aircraft during the lease term while the Group receives rental income and assumes the risks of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease. Initial lease terms range in length up to 12 years, while the average remaining lease term at 31 December 2022 is approximately five years. By varying the lease terms the effects of changes in cyclical market conditions at the time aircraft become eligible for re-lease are mitigated. The Group will look at entering into a lease extension with existing lessees well in advance of lease expiry in order to minimise the risk of aircraft downtime and aircraft transition costs. Aircraft may also be sold from time to time to manage the composition and average age of the fleet.\n\nA series of stress sensitivities conducted on the narrow-body portfolio highlight the two biggest risks remain either an increase in the discount rate, as the majority of the leased portfolio is valued on a VIU basis, or a substantial number of airline clients defaulting. A sensitivity test was performed on the narrow-body portfolio assuming a discount rate increase of 50 basis points from a base range of 4.50%-5.75% (31 December 2021: 4.50%-5.50%), which resulted in a possible increase in impairment of $34 million.\n\nA further sensitivity test considered that the lessees with lower credit ratings defaulted on their current leases. This scenario would result in a possible increase in impairment of $34 million.\n\n|                     | 2022  Minimum lease  receivables  under operating  leases   falling due:  $million   | 2021  Minimum lease  receivables   under operating   leases   falling due:  $million   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Within one year     | 358                                                                                  | 330                                                                                    |\n| One to two years    | 337                                                                                  | 285                                                                                    |\n| Two to three years  | 286                                                                                  | 251                                                                                    |\n| Three to four years | 242                                                                                  | 197                                                                                    |\n| Four to five years  | 211                                                                                  | 153                                                                                    |\n| After five years    | 546                                                                                  | 411                                                                                    |\n|                     | 1,980                                                                                | 1,627                                                                                  |",

Leased assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is a lease in scope of this policy by determining whether the contract gives it the right to use a specified underlying physical asset for a lease term greater than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee and the lease is deemed in scope, it recognises a liability equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable in the economic environment of the lease. The liability is recognised in 'Other liabilities'. A corresponding right-of-use asset equal to the liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, is recognised in 'Property, plant and equipment'. The lease term includes any extension options contained in the contract that the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise.\n\nThe Group subsequently depreciates the right-of-use asset using the straight-line method over the lease term and measures the lease liability using the effective interest method. Depreciation on the asset is recognised in 'Depreciation and amortisation', and interest on the lease liability is recognised in 'Interest expense'.\n\nIf a leased premise, or a physically distinct portion of a premise such as an individual floor, is deemed by management to be surplus to the Group's needs and action has been taken to abandon the space before the lease expires, this is considered an indicator of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the right-of-use asset, or portion thereof, has a carrying value in excess of its value-in-use when taking into account factors such as the ability and likelihood of obtaining a subtenant.\n\nThe judgements in determining lease balances are the determination of whether the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise extension options present in lease contracts. On initial recognition, the Group considers a range of characteristics such as premises function, regional trends and the term remaining on the lease to determine whether it is reasonably certain that a contractual right to extend a lease will be exercised. Where a change in assumption is confirmed by the local property management team, a remeasurement is performed in the Group-managed vendor system.\n\nThe estimates are the determination of incremental borrowing rates in the respective economic environments. The Group uses third-party broker quotes to estimate its USD cost of senior unsecured borrowing, then uses cross currency swap pricing information to determine the equivalent cost of borrowing in other currencies. If it is not possible to estimate an incremental borrowing rate through this process, other proxies such as local government bond yields are used.\n\nThe Group primarily enters lease contracts that grant it the right to use premises such as office buildings and retail branches.\n\nExisting lease liabilities may change in future periods due to changes in assumptions or decisions to exercise lease renewal or termination options, changes in payments due to renegotiations of market rental rates as permitted by those contracts and changes to payments due to rent being contractually linked to an inflation index. In general the re-measurement of a lease liability under these circumstances leads to an equal change to the right-of-use asset balance, with no immediate effect on the income statement.\n\nThe total cash outflow during the year for premises and equipment leases was $310 million (2021: $331 million).\n\nThe total expense during the year in respect of leases with a term less than or equal to 12 months was $nil (2021: $1 million).\n\nThe right-of-use asset balances and depreciation charges are disclosed in Note 18. The lease liability balances are disclosed in Note 23 and the interest expense on lease liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe maturity profile for lease liabilities associated with leased premises and equipment assets is as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2022                          | 2022                                          | 2022                                            | 2022                              | 2022             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n|                                       | One year   or less   $million | Between   one year and   two years   $million | Between   two years and   five years   $million | More than   five years   $million | Total   $million |\n| Other liabilities - lease liabilities | 272                           | 239                                           | 437                                             | 310                               | 1,258            |\n|                                       | 2021                          | 2021                                          | 2021                                            | 2021                              | 2021             |\n|                                       | One year   or less   $million | Between   one year and   two years   $million | Between   two years and   five years   $million | More than   five years   $million | Total   $million |\n| Other liabilities - lease liabilities | 293                           | 247                                           | 521                                             | 175                               | 1,236            |",

Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for a present legal or constructive obligation resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Where a liability arises based on participation in a market at a specified date, the obligation is recognised in the financial statements on that date and is not accrued over the period.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges requires significant judgement and the use of estimates about uncertain future conditions or events.\n\nEstimates include the best estimate of the probability of outflow of economic resources, cost of settling a provision and timing of settlement. Judgements are required for inherently uncertain areas such as legal decisions (including external advice obtained), and outcome of regulator reviews.\n\n|                                  | 2022                                          | 2022                          | 2022            | 2021                                          | 2021                         | 2021            |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                  | Provision   for credit  commitments  $million | Other   provisions   $million | Total  $million | Provision   for credit  commitments  $million | Other   provisions  $million | Total  $million |\n| At 1 January                     | 346                                           | 107                           | 453             | 367                                           | 99                           | 466             |\n| Exchange translation differences | (39)                                          | (2)                           | (41)            | 9                                             | (1)                          | 8               |\n| Transfer                         | -                                             | -                             | -               | -                                             | 2                            | 2               |\n| Charge against profit            | (27)                                          | 69                            | 42              | (30)                                          | 54                           | 24              |\n| Provisions utilised              | -                                             | (71)                          | (71)            | -                                             | (47)                         | (47)            |\n| At 31 December                   | 280                                           | 103                           | 383             | 346                                           | 107                          | 453             |\n\nProvision for credit commitment comprises those undrawn contractually committed facilities where there is doubt as to the borrowers' ability to meet their repayment obligations.\n\nOther provisions include $14 million (31 December 2021: $17 million) recognised for certain contracts with suppliers for which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received.

Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financial guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are initially recognised at their fair value as a financial liability, and subsequently measured at the higher of the initial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provision. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held. Notional values of financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments are disclosed in the table below.\n\nFinancial guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit are the notional values of contracts issued by the Group's Transaction Banking business for which an obligation to make a payment has not arisen at the reporting date. Transaction Banking will issue contracts to clients and counterparties of clients, whereby in the event the holder of the contract is not paid, the Group will reimburse the holder of the contract for the actual financial loss suffered. These contracts have various legal forms such as letters of credit, guarantee contracts and performance bonds. The contracts are issued to facilitate trade through export and import business, provide guarantees to financial institutions where the Group has a local presence, as well as guaranteeing project financing involving large construction projects undertaken by sovereigns and corporates. The contracts may contain performance clauses which require the counterparty performing services or providing goods to meet certain conditions before a right to payment is achieved, however the Group does not guarantee this performance. The Group will only guarantee the credit of the counterparty paying for the services or goods.\n\nCommitments are where the Group has confirmed its intention to provide funds to a customer or on behalf of a customer under prespecified terms and conditions in the form of loans, overdrafts, future guarantees whether cancellable or not and the Group has not made payments at the balance sheet date; those instruments are included in these financial statements as commitments. Commitments and contingent liabilities are generally considered on demand as the Group may have to honour them, or the client may draw down at any time.\n\nCapital commitments are contractual commitments the Group has entered into to purchase non-financial assets.\n\nThe table below shows the contract or underlying principal amounts of unmatured off-balance sheet transactions at the balance sheet date. The contract or underlying principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding and do not represent amounts at risk.\n\n|                                                                                                  | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Financial guarantees and trade credits                                                           |                  |                  |\n| Financial guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit                            | 60,410           | 58,535           |\n|                                                                                                  | 60,410           | 58,535           |\n| Commitments                                                                                      |                  |                  |\n| Undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend                    |                  |                  |\n| One year and over                                                                                | 69,597           | 69,542           |\n| Less than one year                                                                               | 31,688           | 27, 3 0 6        |\n| Unconditionally cancellable                                                                      | 67, 3 8 3        | 61,675           |\n|                                                                                                  | 168,668          | 158,523          |\n| Capital commitments                                                                              |                  |                  |\n| Contracted capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in these accounts\u00b9 | 257              | 124              |\n\nAs set out in Note 26, the Group has contingent liabilities in respect of certain legal and regulatory matters for which it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact as there are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes.",

Legal and regulatory matters\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group recognises a provision for liabilities when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources embodying economic benefits will be required, and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The uncertainties inherent in legal and regulatory matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows with respect to which provisions have been established. These uncertainties also mean that it is not possible to give an aggregate estimate of contingent liabilities arising from such legal and regulatory matters.\n\nThe Group receives legal claims against it in a number of jurisdictions and is subject to regulatory and enforcement investigations and proceedings from time to time. Apart from the matters described below, the Group currently considers none of the ongoing claims, investigations or proceedings to be individually material. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters currently not considered to be material may not ultimately be material to the Group's results in a particular reporting period depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the results otherwise reported for such period.\n\nSince 2014, the Group has been named as a defendant in a series of lawsuits that have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York against a number of banks (including Standard Chartered Bank or its affiliates) on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are relatives of, victims of various terrorist attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The most recent lawsuit was filed in April 2022 and concerns terrorist attacks that occurred in Afghanistan between 2013 and 2016. None of these lawsuits have specified the amount of damages claimed. The plaintiffs in each of these lawsuits have alleged that the defendant banks aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of parties with connections to terrorist organisations in breach of the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The courts have ruled in favour of the banks' motions to dismiss in six of these lawsuits, including a ruling issued in December 2022 in which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismissed a lawsuit filed in August 2021. In January 2023 a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a September 2019 ruling by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in which a lawsuit filed in November 2014 was dismissed. While a ruling is awaited in respect of the Group's motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed in April 2022, the other lawsuits are currently stayed pending a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in another U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act case in which SCB is not involved. An appeal from the December 2022 dismissal ruling is also pending.\n\nIn January 2020, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed by the City of Philadelphia in New York State Court against 45 current and former directors and senior officers of the Group. It is alleged that the individuals breached their duties to the Group and caused a waste of corporate assets by permitting the conduct that gave rise to the costs and losses to the Group related to legacy conduct and control issues. In March 2021, an amended complaint was served in which SCB and seven individuals were removed from the case. Standard Chartered PLC and Standard Chartered Holdings Limited remained as named 'nominal defendants' in the complaint. In May 2021, Standard Chartered PLC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In February 2022, the New York State Court ruled in favour of Standard Chartered PLC's motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs are pursuing an appeal against the February 2022 ruling. A hearing date for the plaintiffs' appeal is awaited.\n\nSince October 2020, four lawsuits have been filed in the English High Court against Standard Chartered PLC on behalf of more than 300 shareholders in relation to alleged untrue and/or misleading statements and/or omissions in information published by Standard Chartered PLC in its rights issue prospectuses of 2008, 2010 and 2015 and/or public statements regarding the Group's historic sanctions, money laundering and financial crime compliance issues. These lawsuits have been brought under sections 90 and 90A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These lawsuits are at an early procedural stage.\n\nBernard Madoff's 2008 confession to running a Ponzi scheme through Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) gave rise to a number of lawsuits against the Group. BMIS and the Fairfield funds (which invested in BMIS) are in bankruptcy and liquidation, respectively. Between 2010 and 2012, five lawsuits were brought against the Group by the BMIS bankruptcy trustee and the Fairfield funds' liquidators, in each case seeking to recover funds paid to the Group's clients pursuant to redemption requests made prior to BMIS' bankruptcy filing. The total amount sought in these cases exceeds USD 300 million, excluding any pre-judgment interest that may be awarded. The four lawsuits commenced by the Fairfield funds' liquidators have been dismissed and the appeals of those dismissals by the funds' liquidators are ongoing.\n\nThe Group has concluded that the threshold for recording provisions pursuant to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not met with respect to the above matters; however, the outcomes of these lawsuits are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.",

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nFinancial instruments issued are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets, or no obligation to issue a variable number of own equity instruments. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\n\nSecurities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or other members of the consolidated Group purchase the Company's equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders' equity of the Group and/or of the Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity of the Group and/or the Company.\n\n|                                                   | Number of  ordinary   shares  millions   | Ordinary   share   capital 1 $million   | Ordinary   share   premium  $million   | Preference   share   premium 2 $million   | Total share  capital and   share premium  $million   | Other   equity  instruments  $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| At 1 January 2021                                 | 3,156                                    | 1,578                                   | 3,986                                  | 1,494                                     | 7, 0 5 8                                             | 4,518                                   |\n| Cancellation of shares including   share buy-back | (77)                                     | (39)                                    | -                                      | -                                         | (39)                                                 | -                                       |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity issuance                 | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | 2,728                                   |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity redemption               | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | (992)                                   |\n| Other movements                                   | -                                        | -                                       | 3                                      | -                                         | 3                                                    | -                                       |\n| At 31 December 2021                               | 3,079                                    | 1,539                                   | 3,989                                  | 1,494                                     | 7,022                                                | 6,254                                   |\n| Cancellation of shares including   share buy-back | (184)                                    | (92)                                    | -                                      | -                                         | (92)                                                 | -                                       |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity issuance                 | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | 1,240                                   |\n| Additional Tier 1 redemption                      | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | (990)                                   |\n| At 31 December 2022                               | 2,895                                    | 1,447                                   | 3,989                                  | 1,494                                     | 6,930                                                | 6,504                                   |\n\n- 1 Issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 cents each\n- 2   Includes preference share capital of $75,000",

On a winding up, the assets of the Company are applied to the holders of the preference shares in priority to any payment to the ordinary shareholders and in priority to, or pari passu with, the holders of any other shares in issue, for an amount equal to any dividends payable (on approval of the Board) and the nominal value of the shares together with any premium as determined by the Board. The redeemable preference shares are redeemable at the paid up amount (which includes premium) at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms of the shares.

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued\n\nThe principal terms of the AT1 securities are described below:\n\n- \u00b7 The securities are perpetual and redeemable, at the option of Standard Chartered PLC in whole but not in part, on the first interest reset date and each date falling five years after the first reset date\n- \u00b7 The securities are also redeemable for certain regulatory or tax reasons on any date at 100 per cent of their principal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. Any redemption is subject to Standard Chartered PLC giving notice to the relevant regulator and the regulator granting permission to redeem\n- \u00b7 Interest payments on these securities will be accounted for as a dividend.\n- \u00b7 Interest on the securities is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of Standard Chartered PLC, subject to certain additional restrictions set out in the terms and conditions. Accordingly, Standard Chartered PLC may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment (or part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.\n- \u00b7 The securities convert into ordinary shares of Standard Chartered PLC, at a pre-determined price detailed in the table above, should the fully loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of the Group fall below 7.0 per cent. Approximately 947 million ordinary shares would be required to satisfy the conversion of all the securities mentioned above\n\nThe securities rank behind the claims against Standard Chartered PLC of (a) unsubordinated creditors, (b) which are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Standard Chartered PLC but not further or otherwise; or (c) which are, or are expressed to be, junior to the claims of other creditors of Standard Chartered PLC, whether subordinated or unsubordinated, other than claims which rank, or are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the AT1 securities in a winding-up occurring prior to the conversion trigger.\n\n## Reserves\n\nThe constituents of the reserves are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The capital reserve represents the exchange difference on redenomination of share capital and share premium from sterling to US dollars in 2001. The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of preference shares redeemed\n- \u00b7 The amounts in the 'Capital and Merger Reserve' represents the premium arising on shares issued using a cash box financing structure, which required the Company to create a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the funding of Korea ($1.9 billion) and Taiwan ($1.2 billion) acquisitions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, primarily for capital maintenance requirements and for the shares issued in 2009 by way of an accelerated book build, the proceeds of which were used in the ordinary course of business of the Group. The funding raised by the 2008, 2010 and 2015 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained within the Company. Of the 2015 funding, $1.5 billion was used to subscribe to additional equity in Standard Chartered Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Apart from the Korea, Taiwan and Standard Chartered Bank funding, the merger reserve is considered realised and distributable.\n- \u00b7 Own credit adjustment reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit. Gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit in the year have been taken through other comprehensive income into this reserve. On derecognition of applicable instruments the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the income statement, but will be transferred within equity to retained earnings\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) debt reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financial assets classified as FVOCI, net of expected credit losses and taxation. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impaired.\n- \u00b7 FVOCI equity reserve represents unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financial assets classified as FVOCI, net of taxation. Gains and losses are recorded in this reserve and never recycled to the income statement\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivatives that meet the criteria for these types of hedges. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying hedged item affects profit and loss or when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur\n- \u00b7 Translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations. Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying foreign operation is disposed. Gains and losses arising from derivatives used as hedges of net investments are netted against the foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the foreign operations\n- \u00b7 Retained earnings represents profits and other comprehensive income earned by the Group and Company in the current and prior periods, together with the after tax increase relating to equity-settled share options, less dividend distributions, own shares held (treasury shares) and share buy-backs\n\nA substantial part of the Group's reserves is held in overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches, principally to support local operations or to comply with local regulations. The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted. In addition, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liabilities might arise.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the distributable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) were $13 billion (31 December 2021: $15.0 billion). These comprised retained earnings and $12.6 billion of the merger reserve account. Distribution of reserves is subject to maintaining minimum capital requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, which can be categorised into defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n\nFor funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. For unfunded defined benefit plans the liability recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders' equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new benefits, benefit enhancements (or reductions) and administration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they were incurred.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThere are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement benefit obligations. This measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies which are inherently uncertain. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality corporate bonds (or, in countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, government bonds) of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the post-employment benefit obligations. This is the approach adopted across our geographies. Where there are inflation-linked bonds available (e.g. United Kingdom and the eurozone), the Group derives inflation based on the market on those bonds, with the market yield adjusted in respect of the United Kingdom to take account of the fact that liabilities are linked to Consumer Price Index inflation, whereas the reference bonds are linked to Retail Price Index inflation. Where no inflation-linked bonds exist, we determine inflation assumptions based on a combination of long-term forecasts and short-term inflation data. Salary growth assumptions reflect the Group's long-term expectations, taking into account future business plans and macroeconomic data (primarily expected future long-term inflation). Demographic assumptions, including mortality and turnover rates, are typically set based on the assumptions used in the most recent actuarial funding valuation, and will generally use industry standard tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect recent historic experience and/or future expectations. The sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.\n\nRetirement benefit obligations comprise:\n\n|                                       |   2022  $million |   2021  $million |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans obligation      |              128 |              192 |\n| Defined contribution plans obligation |               18 |               18 |\n| Net obligation                        |              146 |              210 |\n\nRetirement benefit charge comprises:\n\n|                                |   2022  $million |   2021  $million |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans          |               58 |               62 |\n| Defined contribution plans\u00b9    |              332 |              315 |\n| Charge against profit (Note 7) |              390 |              377 |\n\nThe Group operates over 60 defined benefit plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now join defined contribution arrangements. The aim of all these plans is, as part of the Group's commitment to financial wellbeing for employees, to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions. The defined benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.\n\nThe material holdings of government and corporate bonds shown partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate and inflation changes. Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency fluctuation, the increases in discount rates in most geographies over 2022 have led to lower liabilities. These have been partly offset by decreases in the value of bonds held as well as poor performance of growth assets such as equities and property, leading to a fall in the pension deficit reported. These movements are shown as actuarial gains and losses in the tables below. Contributions into a number of plans in excess of the amounts required to fund benefits accruing have also helped to reduce the net deficit over the year.\n\nThe disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2022.",

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## UK Fund\n\nThe Standard Chartered Pension Fund (the 'UK Fund') is the Group's largest pension plan, representing 53 per cent (31 December 2021: 58 per cent) of total pension liabilities. The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank (its formal sponsor) and, as required by UK legislation, at least one third of the trustee directors are nominated by members; the remainder are appointed by the Bank. The trustee directors have a fiduciary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.\n\nThe UK Fund was closed to new entrants from 1 July 1998 and closed to the accrual of new benefits from 1 April 2018: all UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe financial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualified actuary. The funding valuation as at 31 December 2020 was completed in December 2021 by the Scheme Actuary, T Kripps of Willis Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those, and agreed with the UK Fund trustee. It showed that the UK Fund was 92% funded at that date, revealing a past service deficit of $153 million (\u00a3127 million).\n\nTo repair the deficit, three annual cash payments each of $40 million (\u00a332.9 million) were agreed, with the first of these paid in December 2021, and two further instalments to be paid in December 2022 and December 2023. However, the agreement allowed that, if the funding position improves to being at or near a surplus in future years, the payments due in 2022 and 2023 will be reduced or eliminated. As a result of the Fund being in surplus at the agreed measurement point of mid-year, no payment was made in December 2022. As part of the 2020 valuation, in order to provide security for future contributions an additional $60 million nominal gilts (\u00a350 million) were purchased and transferred into the existing escrow account of $132 million gilts (\u00a3110 million), topping it up to $192 million\n\nThe Group has not recognised any additional liability under IFRIC 14, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.\n\n## Overseas plans\n\nThe principal overseas defined benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States of America (US). Plans in Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and UAE remain open for accrual of future benefits.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used at 31 December 2022 were:\n\n|                   | Funded plans   | Funded plans   | Funded plans     | Funded plans     |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                   | UK Fund        | UK Fund        | Overseas Plans 1 | Overseas Plans 1 |\n|                   | 2022  %        | 2021  %        | 2022  %          | 2021  %          |\n| Discount rate     | 4.8            | 2.0            | 1.2 - 5.4        | 0.4 - 3.1        |\n| Price Inflation   | 2.6            | 2.6            | 1.0 - 3.1        | 1.0 - 3.1        |\n| Salary increases  | N/A            | N/A            | 3.5 - 4.5        | 3.5 - 4.5        |\n| Pension increases | 2.4            | 2.5            | 3.1              | 1.9 - 3.1\u00b2       |\n\n|                              | Unfunded plans                                | Unfunded plans                                | Unfunded plans   | Unfunded plans   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                              | US post-retirement medical                    | US post-retirement medical                    | Other 1          | Other 1          |\n|                              | 2022  %                                       | 2021  %                                       | 2022  %          | 2021  %          |\n| Discount rate                | 5.1                                           | 3.1                                           | 3.7 - 7.6        | 2.2 - 6.7        |\n| Price inflation              | 2.5                                           | 2.5                                           | 2.0 - 4.0        | 2.0 - 4.0        |\n| Salary increases             | N/A                                           | N/A                                           | 4.0 - 7.8        | 3.7 - 7.0        |\n| Pension increases            | N/A                                           | N/A                                           | 0.0 - 2.4        | 0.0 - 2.6        |\n| Post-retirement medical rate | 7% in 2022  reducing   by 0.5%   per annum to | 7% in 2021  reducing   by 0.5%   per annum to | N/A              | N/A              |\n\nThe resulting assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 27 years (2021: 27 years) and a female member for 30 years (2021: 30 years) and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 29 years (2021: 29 years) and a female member for 32 years (2021: 31 years) after their 60th birthdays.",

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nBoth financial and non-financial assumptions can be expected to change in the future, which would affect the value placed on the liabilities. For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:\n\n- \u00b7 If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $30 million for the UK Fund (2021: $65 million) and $15 million for the other plans (2021: $35 million)\n- \u00b7 If the rate of inflation increased by 25 basis points the liability, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases, would increase by approximately $20 million for the UK Fund (2021: $45 million) and $15 million for the other plans (2021: $20 million)\n- \u00b7 If the rate salaries increase compared to inflation increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by nil for the UK Fund (2021: nil) and approximately $10 million for the other plans (2021: $15 million)\n- \u00b7 If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $35 million for the UK Fund (2021: $80 million) and $10 million for the other plans (2021: $15 million)\n\nAlthough this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity to the main assumptions.

        "page_content": "## 31. Share-based payments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services (measured by the fair value of the awards granted) received in exchange for the grant of the shares and awards is recognised as an expense. For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date. For example, the expense for three-year awards granted in 2023 in respect of 2022 performance, which vest in 2024-2026, is recognised as an expense over the period from 1 January 2022 to the vesting dates in 2024-2026. For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and awards at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets). The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binomial option pricing model. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions for the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy service conditions and non-market vesting conditions are treated as a cancellation and the remaining unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when awards in the form of options are exercised.\n\nCash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liability recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised. Where forfeitures occur prior to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy service conditions or market-based performance conditions, the cumulative charge incurred up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement. Any revaluation related to cash-settled awards is recorded as an amount due from subsidiary undertakings.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nShare-based payments involve judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the expenses and carrying values of share awards at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 LTIP awards are determined using an estimation of the probability of meeting certain metrics over a three-year performance period using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n- \u00b7 Deferred shares and restricted shares are determined using an estimation of expected dividends.\n- \u00b7 The 2013 Sharesave Plan valuation is determined using a binomial option-pricing model.\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees.

It may be used to deliver various types of share awards to employees and former employees of the Group, including directors and former executive directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures. Performance measures attached to awards granted previously include: relative total shareholder return (TSR); return on tangible equity (RoTE) (with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) underpin); and strategic measures. Each measure is assessed independently over a three-year period. LTIP awards have an individual conduct gateway requirement that results in the award lapsing if not met\n- \u00b7 Deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory requirements. These awards vest in instalments on anniversaries of the award date specified at the time of grant. Deferred awards are not subject to any plan limit. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice",

Share-based payments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Restricted share awards, made outside of the annual performance process as replacement buy-out awards to new joiners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers, vest in instalments on the anniversaries of the award date specified at the time of grant. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice. In line with similar plans operated by our competitors, restricted share awards are not subject to an annual limit and do not have any performance measures\n\nUnder the 2021 Plan and 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award. The remaining life of the 2021 Plan during which new awards can be made is nine years. The 2011 Plan has expired and no further awards will be granted under this plan.\n\n## Valuation - LTIP awards\n\nThe vesting of awards granted in both 2022 and 2021 is subject to relative TSR performance measures, achievement of a strategic scorecard and satisfaction of RoTE (subject to a capital CET1 underpin). The vesting of awards also have additional conditions under strategic measures related to targets set for sustainability linked to business strategy. The fair value of the TSR component is calculated using the probability of meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of shares expected to vest is evaluated at each reporting date, based on the expected performance against the RoTE and strategic measures in the scorecard, to determine the accounting charge.\n\nNo dividend equivalents accrue for the LTIP awards made in 2022 or 2021 and the fair value takes this into account, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.\n\n|                               | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Grant date                    | 14-March   | 15-March   |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 4.88       | 4.9        |\n| Vesting period (years)        | 3-Jul      | 3-Jul      |\n| Expected divided yield (%)    | 3.4        | 3.4        |\n| Fair value (RoTE) (\u00a3)         | 1.24, 1.20 | 1.25, 1.20 |\n| Fair value (TSR) (\u00a3)          | 0.70, 0.68 | 0.72, 0.71 |\n| Fair value (Strategic) (\u00a3)    | 1.65, 1.60 | 1.66, 1.60 |\n\n## Valuation - deferred shares and restricted shares\n\nThe fair value for deferred awards which are not granted to material risk takers is based on 100 per cent of the face value of the shares at the date of grant as the share price will reflect expectations of all future dividends. For awards granted to material risk takers in 2022, the fair value of awards takes into account the lack of dividend equivalents, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.\n\n## Deferred share awards\n\n|                               | 2022                          | 2022             | 2022                          | 2022             | 2022                          | 2022                           |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Grant date                    | 09 November                   | 09 November      | 20 June                       | 20 June          | 14 March                      | 14 March                       |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 5.62                          | 5.62             | 6.04                          | 6.04             | 4.88                          | 4.88                           |\n| Vesting period (years)        | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)               |\n| 1-3 years                     | N/A                           | 5.62             | N/A                           | 6.04             | N/A                           | 4.88                           |\n| 1-5 years                     | 3.4                           | 5.17             | 3.4, 3.4                      | 5.56, 5.56       | N/A, 3.4,   3.4, 3.4          | 4.88, 4.48,  4.41, 4.34        |\n| 3-7 years                     | -                             | -                | -                             | -                | 3.4,3.4,3.4                   | 4.48, 4.13,                    |\n|                               |                               |                  | 2021                          | 2021             | 2021                          | 2021                           |\n| Grant date                    |                               |                  | 21 June                       | 21 June          | 15 March                      | 15 March                       |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) |                               |                  | 4.69                          | 4.69             | 4.90                          | 4.90                           |\n| Vesting period (years)        |                               |                  | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)               |\n| 1-3 years                     |                               |                  | N/A, 3.4                      | 4.69, 4.24       |                               | N/A, 3.4, 3.4 4.90, 4.58, 4.43 |\n| 1-5 years                     |                               |                  | 3.4                           | 4.17             | 3.4, 3.4, 3.4                 | 4.43, 4.36, 4.29               |\n| 3-7 years                     |                               |                  | -                             | -                | 3.4, 3.4                      | 4.15, 4.01                     |",

Plans\n\n## 2013 Sharesave Plan\n\nUnder the 2013 Sharesave Plan, employees may open a savings contract. Employees can save up to \u00a3250 per month over three years to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of invitation (the 'option exercise price'), after which they have a period of six months to exercise the option. There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the 2013 Sharesave Plan and no grant price is payable to receive an option. In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to securities law and regulatory restrictions. In these countries, where possible, the Group offers an equivalent cash-based alternative to its employees.\n\nThe 2013 Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2013, and expires in May 2023. A new Sharesave plan will be taken to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting in May 2023.\n\n## Valuation - Sharesave:\n\nOptions under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binomial option-pricing model. The same fair value is applied to all employees including executive directors. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:\n\n## All Employee Sharesave Plan (Sharesave)\n\n|                               | 2022                     | 2021                     |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Grant date                    | 28 November 30 September | 28 November 30 September |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 5.80                     | 4.37                     |\n| Exercise price (\u00a3)            | 4.23                     | 3.67                     |\n| Vesting period (years)        | 3                        | 3                        |\n| Expected volatility (%)       | 39.3                     | 35.1                     |\n| Expected option life (years)  | 3.33                     | 3.33                     |\n| Risk-free rate (%)            | 3.21                     | 0.42                     |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)   | 3.4                      | 3.4                      |\n| Fair value (\u00a3)                | 2.08                     | 1.11                     |\n\nThe expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years, or three years prior to grant.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities, which the Group controls. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, and has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The assessment of power is based on the Group's practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity unilaterally for the Group's own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsidiary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Associates and joint arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligations of the joint arrangement (joint operations), or have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement (joint venture). The Group evaluates the contractual terms of joint arrangements to determine whether a joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. The Group did not have any contractual interest in joint operations.\n\n## An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group's investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition (net of any accumulated impairment loss).\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Group's investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.",

        "page_content": "## 32. Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group applies judgement in determining if it has control, joint control or significant influence over subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates respectively. These judgements are based upon identifying the relevant activities of counterparties, being those activities that significantly affect the entities returns, and further making a decision of if the Group has control over those entities, joint control, or has significant influence (being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions but not control them).\n\nThese judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings. However, further considerations including but not limited to board seats, advisory committee members and specialist knowledge of some decision-makers are also taken into account. Further judgement is required when determining if the Group has de-facto control over an entity even though it may hold less than 50% of the voting shares of that entity. Judgement is required to determine the relative size of the Group's shareholding when compared to the size and dispersion of other shareholders.\n\nImpairment testing of investments in associates and joint ventures, and on a Company level investments in subsidiaries is performed if there is a possible indicator of impairment. Judgement is used to determine if there is objective evidence of impairment. Objective evidence may be observable data such as losses incurred on the investment when applying the equity method, the granting of concessions as a result of financial difficulty, or breaches of contracts/regulatory fines of the associate or joint venture. Further judgement is required when considering broader indicators of impairment such as losses of active markets or ratings downgrades across key markets in which the associate or joint venture operate in.\n\nImpairment testing is based on estimates including forecasting the expected cash flows from the investments, growth rates, terminal values and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with the fair value of any contingent consideration payable. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill (see Note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the Group). If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nWhere the fair values of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired have been determined provisionally, or where contingent or deferred consideration is payable, adjustments arising from their subsequent finalisation are not reflected in the income statement if (i) they arise within 12 months of the acquisition date (or relate to acquisitions completed before 1 January 2014) and (ii) the adjustments arise from better information about conditions existing at the acquisition date (measurement period adjustments). Such adjustments are applied as at the date of acquisition and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated. All changes that are not measurement period adjustments are reported in income other than changes in contingent consideration not classified as financial instruments, which are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent consideration classified as equity, which is not remeasured.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity. Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the acquisition date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn the Company's financial statements, investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are held at cost less impairment and dividends from pre-acquisition profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the Group accounts.\n\n| Investments in subsidiary undertakings   | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| As at 1 January                          | 60,429           | 57,407           |\n| Additions 1                              | 1,545            | 4,023            |\n| Disposal 2                               | (999)            | (1,001)          |\n| As at 31 December                        | 60,975           | 60,429           |",

These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels of regulatory capital, liquid assets, exposure limits and comply with other required ratios. These restrictions are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory and liquidity requirements\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital, leverage ratios, liquidity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or other assets to the parent company.\n\nThe subsidiaries are also required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. At 31 December 2022, the total cash and balances with central banks was $58 billion (31 December 2021: $73 billion) of which $9 billion (31 December 2021: $8 billion) is restricted.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits to the parent company, generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends to the Group. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrictions on exporting capital from the country other than through normal dividends.",

Limited and a cash injection into CurrencyFair of $35 million, which provided the Group with equity of 43.42% in CurrencyFair. This ownership, along with seats on the board of directors resulted in the Group having significant influence over CurrencyFair and as such would equity method account the investment.\n\nThe transaction will facilitate creation of a combined payments and foreign exchange products franchise, combining the customer base, staff, expertise and capabilities of both CurrencyFair and Assembly Payments.\n\nThe fair value of consideration for the investment was as follows:\n\n| Consideration                                               |   $million |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Fair value of the Group's investment in Assembly Payments 1 |         36 |\n| Cash consideration                                          |         35 |\n| Total consideration/investment in associate                 |         71 |\n\nThe Group's ownership percentage in China Bohai Bank is 16.26%.\n\nAlthough the Group's investment in China Bohai Bank is less than 20 per cent but it is considered to be an associate because of the significant influence the Group is able to exercise over the management and financial and operating policies. This influence is primarily through board representation and the provision of technical expertise to Bohai. The Group applies the equity method of accounting for investments in associates.",

Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued\n\nBohai has a statutory year end of 31 December, but publishes its year-end financial statements after the Group. As it is impracticable for Bohai to prepare financial statements earlier for use of the Group, the Group recognises its share of Bohai's earnings on a three-month lag basis. Therefore, the Group recognised its share of Bohai's profits and movements in other comprehensive income for the 12 months ended 30 September 2022 in the Group's consolidated statemement of income and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2022, respectively.\n\nThere have been no material events after 30 September 2022 which would require adjustments in respect of the share of Bohai's profits and movements in OCI recognised by the Group for the period ended on 31 December 2022.\n\nIf the Group did not have significant influence in Bohai, the investment would be carried at fair value rather than the current carrying value.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the listed equity value of Bohai is below the carrying amount of the Group's investment in associate. As a result, the Group assessed the carrying value of its investment in Bohai for impairment and concluded that an impairment loss of $308 million (2021: $300 million) was required. The revised carrying value of the Group's investment in Bohai of $1,421 million (2021: $1,917 million) represents the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The financial forecasts used for the VIU calculation reflects the current economic conditions. The reduction (compared to 2021) in the recoverable amount of Bohai is primarily a result of industry challenges and uncertainties that may impact profitability, as well as lower net profits reported in Q3 2022 (than in Q3 2021), which is used as a starting point for the VIU calculation.\n\n| Bohai             | 2022   $million   | 2021   $million   |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| VIU               | 1,421             | 1,917             |\n| Carrying amount 1 | 1,729             | 2,217             |\n| Fair value\u00b2       | 685               | 1,114             |\n\n## Basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of Bohai, determined as the higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount.\n\nThe value in use ('VIU') is calculated using a dividend discount model ('DDM'), which estimates the distributable future cash flows to the equity holders, after adjusting for the regulatory capital requirements, for a 5-year period, after which a terminal value ('TV') is calculated based on the 'Gordon Growth' model. The key assumptions in the VIU are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short to medium term projections are based on management's best estimates of future profits available to ordinary shareholders and have been determined with reference to the latest published financial results and historical performance of Bohai;\n- \u00b7 The projections use publicly available information and include normalised performance over the forecast period, inclusive of: (i) net profit growth assumptions based on China GDP; (ii) ECL assumptions using Bohai historical ECL and the prevailing Chinese market challenges and uncertainties as a basis; and (iii) net interest margin increases from 2024 with reference to third party market interest rate forecasts in China;\n- \u00b7 The discount rate applied to these cash flows was estimated with reference to transaction and broker data in the local Chinese market, cross checked to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which includes a long term risk-free rate, beta and company risk premium assumptions for Bohai;\n- \u00b7 A long term growth rate for China is used to extrapolate the expected short to medium term earnings to perpetuity to derive a terminal value; and\n- \u00b7 An estimation of RWAs and RWA growth to determine a capital maintenance haircut to forecast profits. This haircut is taken in order for Bohai to meet its target regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period. This haircut takes into account movements in risk weighted assets and the total capital required, including required retained earnings over time to meet the target capital rations.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the VIU calculation:\n\n|                                       | 2022   %   | 2021   %   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Pre tax discount rate                 | 13.03      | 14.83      |\n| Forecast profit long term growth rate | 4.00       | 4.75       |\n| Long term RWA growth rate             | 4.00       | 4.75       |\n| Minimum CET 1 ratio\u00b9                  | 7. 5 0     | 7. 5 0     |",

Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entity indicates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activities of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.\n\nIn determining whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its ability to direct the relevant activities of the structured entity. These relevant activities are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liquidate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds specific subordinate securities that embody certain controlling rights. The Group may further consider relevant activities embedded within contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical ability to direct the entity, special relationships between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.\n\nJudgement is required in determining control over structured entities. The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determination of what the relevant activities are of the entity and who directs these. Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity. The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others. Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities, specifically if market conditions have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.\n\nThe Group has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by the Group as a sponsor or by a third-party.\n\nInterests in consolidated structured entities: A structured entity is consolidated into the Group's financial statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determination in the accounting policy above. The following table presents the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities.\n\n|                                        | 2022  $million   | 2021  $million   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Aircraft and ship leasing              | 3,531            | 3,450            |\n| Principal and other structured finance | 330              | 229              |\n| Total                                  | 3,861            | 3,679            |\n\nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities: Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by the Group. The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities. This is predominantly within the CCIB business segment.  An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability of the returns of the Group arising from the performance of the structured entity.",

Structured entities continued\n\nThe table below presents the carrying amount of the assets recognised in the financial statements relating to interests held in unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities. Maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the Group's on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity. For derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount. For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.\n\n|                                                             | 2022\u00b9                               | 2022\u00b9                                               | 2022\u00b9                               | 2022\u00b9                       | 2022\u00b9           | 2021 (Restated)\u00b2                    | 2021 (Restated)\u00b2                                    | 2021 (Restated)\u00b2                    | 2021 (Restated)\u00b2            | 2021 (Restated)\u00b2   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                             | Asset- backed  securities  $million | Corporate  Lending &  Structured  Finance  $million | Principal  Finance  funds  $million | Other  activities  $million | Total  $million | Asset- backed  securities  $million | Corporate  Lending &  Structured  Finance\u00b9 $million | Principal  Finance  funds  $million | Other  activities  $million | Total  $million    |\n| Group's interest -

These are detailed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset-backed securities (ABS): The Group also has investments in asset-backed securities issued by third-party sponsored and managed structured entities. For the purpose of market making and at the discretion of ABS trading desk, the Group may hold an immaterial amount of debt securities from structured entities originated by credit portfolio management. This is disclosed in the ABS column above.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio management (Group sponsored entities): For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issuing structured entities. This credit protection creates credit risk which the structured entity and subsequently the end investor absorbs. The referenced assets remain on the Group's balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entities. The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets. The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securitisation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of eligible credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Group's balance sheet. The Group does not hold any equity interests in the structured entities, but may hold an insignificant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes. This is disclosed in the ABS section above. The proceeds of the notes' issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuer's account operated by a trustee or invested in AAArated government-backed securities to collateralise the structured entities swap obligations to the Group, and to repay the principal to investors at maturity. The structured entities reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the cash collateral or realisation of the collateral security. Correspondingly, the structured entities write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of seniority. All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no indirect exposure in respect of the vehicles' liquidity position. The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because the Group is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entities have Standard Chartered branding.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Lending & Structured finance: Corporate Lending comprises secured lending in the normal course of business to third parties through structured entities.\n- Structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entities, which provide beneficial arrangements for customers. The Group's exposure primarily represents the provision of funding to these structures as a financial intermediary, for which it receives a lender's return. The transactions largely relate to real estate financing and the provision of aircraft leasing and ship finance.\n- \u00b7 Principal finance fund: The Group's exposure to Principal Finance Funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds, primarily investing in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity.\n- \u00b7 Other activities: Other activities include structured entities created to support margin financing transactions, the refinancing of existing credit and debt facilities, as well as setting up of bankruptcy remote structured entities.",

Post balance sheet events\n\nOn 9 January 2023, Standard Chartered PLC issued $1 billion 6.170 per cent Fixed Rate Reset Notes due 2027 and $1.5 billion 6.301 per cent Fixed Rate Reset Notes due 2029.\n\nThe Group announced, on 11 January 2023, the launch of the process to explore alternatives for the future ownership of its aviation finance business within the CCIB business segment.  While an auction is now underway, no commitment to a sale existed at 31 December 2022 and, in accordance with IFRS 5, the Group did not meet the requirements to classify the business as 'held for sale'. While it is not possible to estimate the financial effect of a sale at this stage, as no bids have been received yet, we do not expect to execute it at below our book values.\n\nA share buy-back for up to a maximum consideration of $1 billion has been declared by the directors after 31 December 2022. This will reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares.\n\nA final dividend for 2022 of 14 cents per ordinary share was declared by the directors after 31 December 2022.\n\n## 38. Auditor's remuneration\n\nAuditor's remuneration is included within other general administration expenses.

It enables our employees to do the right thing and strengthens their relationships with our communities as well as each other. Each employee is entitled to up to four days of paid volunteering leave a year, which can be used for bank-wide initiatives or supporting charitable causes of their choice.\n\nWith thousands of EV hours undertaken globally, here are three champions who are truly here for good.\n\n## [[ Creating a cultural exchange for good]]\n\n## Meet Arie Vidi N Nurcholis, Indonesia\n\nArie mobilised his Client Acquisitions and Client Care Centre team of 400 people to volunteer together.\n\nWith over 90 per cent of his colleagues being Muslim, they came together to support their local orphanage during Ramadan. They provided daily breakfasts and rolled up their sleeves to help with the building and maintenance work at the orphanage.\n\nAs part of their cultural exchange, at the end of the year, they also supported an annual Christmas gathering at a local catholic orphanage, providing food and gifts to the children.\n\nThis work not only brought their team together but uplifted the children they visited.\n\n<!-- image -->",

She led our Women in Tech programme in the Americas, specifically our #Bossgirls initiative, which is an entrepreneurship bootcamp for high schoolers in the United States. As part of her work, she managed volunteer recruitment and taught financial education as part of the curriculum.\n\nChantele also mentored students in the Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America programme. The programme aims to diversify the talent pipeline by helping high school students from under-resourced communities gain entry to the nation's most selective colleges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meet Antony Ngure, Kenya\n\nWhen our team in Kenya entered a partnership with the Nairobi Arboretum Conservancy Community Forest Association and committed to creating a tree nursery of 1 million seedlings by 2024, Antony was determined to help. Antony mobilised 367 team members to help plant seedlings. This translated to 32 per cent staff participation in EV, in Kenya. He also led the distribution of 23,000 seedlings to the participants of our second sustainable marathon in 2022 - up from 5,000 seedlings distributed in 2021.\n\nHis commitment to the environment earned him the nickname - Antony wa miti (Antony of trees).",

For the purpose of these tables, average balances have been determined on the basis of daily balances, except for certain categories, for which balances have been determined less frequently. The Group does not believe that the information presented in these tables would be significantly different had such balances been determined on a daily basis.\n\n## Average assets\n\n|                                                                           | 2022                                               | 2022                                            | 2022                        | 2022           | 2022                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Average assets                                                            | Average  non-interest  earning   balance  $million | Average   interest- earning   balance  $million | Interest   income  $million | Gross yield  % | Gross yield  total balance  % |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                        | 19,700                                             | 54,503                                          | 765                         | 1.40           | 1.03                          |\n| Gross loans and advances to banks                                         | 29,576                                             | 42,953                                          | 853                         | 1.99           | 1.18                          |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers                                     | 61,480                                             | 306,880                                         | 10,168                      | 3.31           | 2.76                          |\n| Impairment provisions against loans and advances to banks   and customers | -

All aggregate and intensity emissions figures use location based data as their foundation\n- 4  We use an independent third-party assurance provider to verify our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2022, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as waste and water consumption, were assured by Global Documentation Ltd, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting. All energy consumed in the UK is from verified renewable sources and therefore this is zero\n- 5 Emissions reporting for purchased goods (other), capital goods and miscellaneous travel other than flights for the period 2020 and 2021 was finalised during 2022 and reported in our CDP submission\n- 6  Calculation of category 1: Purchased Goods, category 2: Capital Goods, category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution and Category 6: Miscellaneous travel is based on lagged data from the period 1 Jan 2021 to 31 December 2021. Estimated supplier emissions for 2022 expected to be available in Q2 2023\n- 7 The decrease in emissions from data centers was due to the offset of REC's (Renewable Energy Certificate) against the total energy consumption. REC's are a type of Energy Attribute Certificate that represents the environmental attributes of the generation of a one-megawatt hour (MWh) of energy produced by renewable sources ie the proportion of power sourced from a national grid that is produced using renewable energy sources\n- 8  Not relevant. We have no fuel or energy related activities which are not already captured in Scope 1 or 2 submission. Standard Chartered are a financial institution and as such we do not mine, refine, transmit or distribute fuels. there are therefore no losses in said activities. We also do not generate power to sell to market. We only generate power from standby generators for our own consumption. Emissions from this activity is covered under Scope 1 emissions\n- 9  Emissions from waste extrapolated for whole company from measured office data using both landfill and recycled emission factors from Commercial and Industrial Waste sourced from DEFRA\n- 10 Emissions for Category 5: Waste generated in operations, Category 7: Employee Commuting and Category 13: Downstream Leased Assets was measured and reported for the first time in 2022",

        "page_content": "- 11  Measured Scope 3 flight emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 35 countries, based on seating class and distance flown. This data is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from. As we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or international with flight distance of less than 785km, labeled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) as domestic flights, have been classified as short haul. All flights with distance flown ranging from 785 to 3,700km, labeled by DBEIS as short haul have been classified as medium haul. All flights with a distance flown in excess of 3,700km are classified as long haul\n- 12  Commuting and working from home emissions extrapolated for the whole company from a sample survey responses for a selection of sites and countries, which examined distance/mode of transport and heating/cooling at home. The Calculation is based on the Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper, EcoAct 2020\n- 13  Not relevant. Scope 3 emissions from upstream leased assets are not relevant as they are included in Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The Group leases approximately 70% of its portfolio, either whole building or part from Landlords\n- 14  Not relevant. As a financial institution, the Group does not transport or distribute products on a material scale. Most of our products are electronically distributed using technology hosted in third-party data centers, disclosed under Scope 3 Category 1\n- 15  Not relevant. As a provider of financial services, our products are predominantly intangible. Therefore this is not a material source of emissions for our business\n- 16  Emissions derived from real estate downstream leased assets ie those assets owned but not occupied by SCB. Measured and applied with energy use intensity value to create a consumption in kWhs per annum and then multiplied by country emission factor\n- 17  This is the downstream leased assets in the groups aviation portfolio. Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been included\n- 18  Not relevant. The Group does not operate any franchises\n- 19  These are financed emissions of our CCIB lending portfolio. Our financed emissions in 2022 are 58.5 MTCO2e, up from 45.2 MTCO2e in 2021. This was following the inclusion of 3 additional transport sectors into the financed emissions calculation. For further details refer to the Measurement and progress of our financed emissions : sectoral deep dives for further details. Our analysis currently covers 61% of the financed emissions of the CCIB portfolio with further sectors to be added to the analysis in future\n- 20 We measured data from 98% of our properties to calculate our energy use across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation. Figures for renewable, non-renewable and total energy in GWh are rounded to one decimal place - therefore some discrepancies in rounded sum totals may arise. Total consumption figures have been verified as accurate from source data. This also applies to previous periods which are therefore restated to the same level of detail. Further detail on the types of energy included within these calculations can be found at sc.com/environmentcriteria\n- 21  This value represents the total energy of heating, cooling and electricity consumption globally. Total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period\n- 22 We measured data from 69% of our properties to calculate our water use across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from\n- 23 Areas of high and extremely high water stress determined according to WRI Aqueduct tool. As accessed on 27 Jan 2023, these countries are South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Bharain, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Pakistan, India, Thailand, China, Egypt and T\u00fcrkiye. This is a new reporting addition for 2022\n- 24 We measured data from 92% of our properties to calculate our waste across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from\n\n## Additional notes on environment data\n\nThe emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. This is to allow sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting. This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice.\n\nWe use an independent third-party assurance provider to verify our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are independently assured by Global Documentation, in accordance with ISO 14064.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our environment reporting criteria at sc.com/environmentcriteria\n\nRead our independent assurance report at sc.com/environmentalassurance",

There is no implication for capital gains tax (no gain or loss) when you donate shares to charity, and UK taxpayers may be able to claim income tax relief on the value of their donation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information can be obtained from the Company's registrars or from ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or from sharegift.org\n\n## Bankers' Automated Clearing System (BACS)\n\nDividends can be paid straight into your bank or building society account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease register online at investorcentre.co.uk or contact our registrar for a dividend mandate form\n\n## Registrars and shareholder enquiries\n\nIf you have any enquiries relating to your shareholding and you hold your shares on the UK register, please contact our registrar at investorcentre.co.uk and click on the 'ASK A QUESTION' link at the bottom of the page.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, projections, estimates, commitments, plans, approaches, ambitions and targets (including, without limitation, ESG commitments, ambitions and targets). Forward-looking statements often use words such as 'may', 'could', 'will', 'expect', 'intend', 'estimate', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'plan', 'seek', 'aim', 'continue' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements may also (or additionally) be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group's plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Readers should not place reliance on, and are cautioned about relying on, any forward-looking statements.\n\nThere are several factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forwardlooking statements.

        "page_content": "## Repo/reverse repo\n\nA repurchase agreement or repo is a short-term funding agreement, which allows a borrower to sell a financial asset, such as asset-backed securities or government bonds as collateral for cash. As part of the agreement the borrower agrees to repurchase the security at some later date, usually less than 30 days, repaying the proceeds of the loan. For the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future), it is a reverse repurchase agreement or reverse repo.\n\n## Residential mortgage\n\nA loan to purchase a residential property which is then used as collateral to guarantee repayment of the loan. The borrower gives the lender a lien against the property, and the lender can foreclose on the property if the borrower does not repay the loan per the agreed terms. Also known as a home loan.\n\n## RoRWA or Return on riskweighted assets\n\nProfit before tax for year as a percentage of RWA. Profit may be statutory or underlying and is specified where used. See 'RWA' and 'Underlying earnings'.\n\n## RWA or Risk-weighted assets\n\nA measure of a bank's assets adjusted for their associated risks, expressed as a percentage of an exposure value in accordance with the applicable standardised or IRB approach provisions.\n\n## Risks-not-in-VaR (RNIV)\n\nA framework for identifying and quantifying marginal types of market risk that are not captured in the Value at Risk (VaR) measure for any reason, such as being a far-tail risk or the necessary historical market data not being available.\n\n## Roll rate\n\nUses a matrix that gives average loan migration rate from delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multiplication is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n\n## Scope 1 emissions\n\nArise from the consumption of energy from direct sources during the use of property occupied by the Group. On-site combustion of fuels such as diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas is recorded using meters or, where\n\nmetering is not available, collated from fuel vendor invoices. Emissions from the combustion of fuel in Group-operated transportation devices, as well as fugitive emissions, are excluded as being immaterial.\n\n## Scope 2 emissions\n\nArise from the consumption of indirect sources of energy during the use of property occupied by the Group. Energy generated off-site in the form of purchased electricity, heat, steam or cooling is collected as kilowatt hours consumed using meters or, where metering is not available, collated from vendor invoices. For leased properties we include all indirect and direct sources of energy consumed by building services (amongst other activities) within the space occupied by the Group. This can include base building services under landlord control but over which we typically hold a reasonable degree of influence. All data centre facilities with conditioning systems and hardware remaining under the operational control of the Group are included in the reporting. This does not include energy used at outsourced data centre facilities which are captured under Scope 3.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nOccur as a consequence of the Group's activities but arising from sources not controlled by the Group. Business air travel data is collected as person kilometres travelled by seating class by employees of the Group. Data are drawn from country operations that have processes in place to gather accurate employee air travel data from travel management companies. Flights are categorised as short, medium or long haul trips. Emissions from other potential Scope 3 sources such as electricity transmission and distribution line losses are not currently accounted for on the basis that they cannot be calculated with an acceptable level of reliability or consistency. The Group does however capture Scope 3 emissions from outsourced data centres managed by third parties.\n\n## Secured (fully and partially)\n\nA secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges an asset as collateral for a loan which, in the event that the borrower defaults, the Group is able to take possession of. All secured loans are considered fully secured if the fair value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan at the time of origination. All other secured loans are considered to be partly secured.\n\n## Securitisation\n\nSecuritisation is a process by which credit exposures are aggregated into a pool, which is used to back new securities. Under traditional securitisation transactions, assets are sold to a structured entity which then issues new securities to investors at different levels of seniority (credit tranching). This allows the credit quality of the assets to be separated from the credit rating of the originating institution and transfers risk to external investors in a way that meets their risk appetite. Under synthetic securitisation transactions, the transfer of risk is achieved by the use of credit derivatives or guarantees, and the exposures being securitised remain exposures of the originating institution.\n\n## Senior debt\n\nDebt that takes priority over other unsecured or otherwise more 'junior' debt owed by the issuer. Senior debt has greater seniority in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, senior debt theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.\n\n## SICR or Significant increase in credit risk\n\nAssessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at origination (after considering the passage of time).\n\n## Solo\n\nThe solo regulatory group as defined in the Prudential Regulation Authority waiver letter dated 10 August 2020 differs from Standard Chartered Bank Company in that it includes the full consolidation of nine subsidiaries, namely Standard Chartered Holdings (International) B.V., Standard Chartered MB Holdings B.V., Standard Chartered UK Holdings Limited, Standard Chartered Grindlays PTY Limited, SCMB Overseas Limited, Standard Chartered Capital Management (Jersey) LLC, Cerulean Investments L.P., SC Ventures Innovation Investment L.P. and SC Ventures G.P. Limited.\n\n## Sovereign exposures\n\nExposures to central governments and central government departments, central banks and entities owned or guaranteed by the aforementioned. Sovereign exposures, as defined by the European Banking Authority, include only exposures to central governments.",
