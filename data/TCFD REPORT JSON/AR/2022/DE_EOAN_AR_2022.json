We are gradually developing them into intelligent platforms that control complex energy and data flows and provide customers with new options for dealing with energy. Without distribution networks there can be no energy tr ansition and no climate protection. The expansion, modernization, and operation of distribution networks support security of supply and ensure the most efficient use of green electricity. This makes our networks the foundation of livable cities, communities, and regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer Solutions\n\nOur solutions help customers meet their personal energy needs and decarbonization goals. This includes energy sales, which offers a wide range of green electricity and green gas tariffs, as well as our solutions business, which provides innovative, sustainable, and digital products and services. S olar power systems, e M obility, energy storage, sensible energy control, and solutions for sector integration enable our customers to reduce their costs and emissions and also to increase their comfort and quality of life. This applies equally to residential customers and small businesses as well as large companies and municipalities.\n\n## Europe's energy system is becoming ever lower in CO2, more decentralized, and more digital. In short: more sustainable.\n\nOur two core businesses -energy networks and customer solutions -are playing a big role in making this happen . E.ON is one of Europe's largest operators of energy networks and energy infrastructure and providers of innovative customer solutions. The contribution of our roughly 72,000 employees is therefore crucial to successfully propelling the energy transition in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our mission is to provide prompt, precise, and relevant information at our periodic conferences and road shows worldwide -because maintaining regular communications and relationships is essential for good investor relations. The subsiding of the Covid -19 pandemic enabled us to carry out a significant part of our investor relations activities in 2022 in person. We will adopt a hybrid approach of virtual and in -person activities in the future. This will help us communicate with capital markets efficiently and purposefully and meet our investors' needs.\n\n## E.ON Stock Symbols and Identification Numbers\n\n| Reuters: Xetra                                        | EONGn.DE     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Reuters: Frankfurt Stock Exchange                     | EONGn.F      |\n| Bloomberg: Frankfurt Stock Exchange                   | EOAN GY      |\n| Bloomberg: ADR over - the -counter code               | EOANGY US    |\n| Security Identification Numbers                       |              |\n| Germany                                               | ENAG99       |\n| International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) | DE000ENAG999 |\n\n## Expansion of Financing Sources and Flexibility\n\nDebt capital represents an important financing source for the E.ON Group. That is why we focus on satisfying the demands of creditors as well as those of shareholders. During the year under review, E.ON decided to commission Fitch Ratings to assess its creditworthiness to supplement the credit ratings of Standard & Poor's and Moody's. E.ON believes that another commissioned rating will provide debt investors with additional visibility and confidence in E.ON's creditworthiness and thus support its competitiveness for future financing activities. Fitch rates E.ON's corporate credit risk at BBB+ with a stable outlook and its bonds at A-.\n\nE.ON aims to maximize the diversity of its investor base to ensure that it has cost -optimized access to a variety of funding sources at all times. In 2022 E.ON therefore began to issue bonds denominated in other currencies as well. In addition to euro -denominated corporate bonds totaling \u20ac3.4 billion, E.ON made a private placement in Norwegian kroner ('NOK') in 2022 equal to around \u20ac150 million and issued two bonds in Swiss francs ('CHF') equal to about \u20ac306 million. Despite a difficult capital market environment, these issuances allowed to secure around \u20ac1 billion in prefinancing for the financial year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON has a \u20ac10 billion Commercial Paper ('CP') program and a $10 billion CP program, under which it can issue short -term notes. After years of inactivity, the U.S. dollar CP program was renewed in 2022 and has since then been utilized again.\n\n## Financial Framework for Sustainable Funding\n\nSustainability aspects play an increasingly important role in many international investors' decision for or against a particular investment. In 2021 E.ON became the first company to fully align its Green Bond Framework, under which it issues debt instruments whose issuance proceeds fund sustainable investment projects, not only with the ICMA Green Bond Principles but also with the EU Taxonomy. The EU Taxonomy Regulation defines which economic activities are classified as environmentally sustainable, thereby setting a Europe -wide standard for sustainable investment. E.ON generally intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual financing requirements with green bonds. Accordingly, green bonds accounted for about 60 percent of total bond financing of just under \u20ac3.9 billion in 2022. We provide detailed information on the topic of financing in the 'Financial Situation' chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

And although one would never hope for such a crisis, crises always create opportunities as well. The opportunity for our company is an even faster energy transition and thus the affirmation of our strategy.\n\nThe previous 12 months were a challenge in every respect, the likes of which even I haven't experienced in 20 years in the energy industry. Energy import bottlenecks, rising wholesale prices, interventionist policies -we were confronted with a variety of situations that we wouldn't have considered remotely possible before the energy crisis. Two key issues for society have always been at the forefront: energy security and energy affordability. One thing has now become clear: E.ON -the reliable operation of our critical energy infrastructure and our portfolio of customer solutions -has definitely become even more relevant.\n\nMany correct and necessary policy decisions were made in 2022, in Germany and at the European level. We at E.ON got a lot right too and worked for our customers every day. We're much more resilient today than we were just a few months ago. We were able to successfully tackle the energy crisis and manage risks, particularly in our sales business, and are in a better position than before. Currently there's no better owner for this business than E.ON. This benefits you as shareholders too: I'm pleased to report that we fully met and in some cases surpassed our financial targets for 2022. In addition, we made great progress with the Group's debt situation. We're delivering on our dividend promise as well: at the Annual Shareholders Meeting in May, the Management Board and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 51 cents per share. This is the eighth dividend increase in a row.\n\nNow 2023 must also be a year of correct and courageous decisions to do better in the short term and to achieve social goals in the long term as part of the energy transition. What needs to be done to achieve this?",

        "page_content": "## To Our Investors\n\n- \u2192 E.ON on the Capital Market\n- \u2192 CEO Letter \u2192 Report of the Supervisory Board\n\n## I have three messages for you:\n\nFirst , Europe must not lull itself into a false sense of (energy) security. We must continue to conserve energy, because the crisis isn't yet past. The race to get through this winter is over, but we need to prepare well for next winter. Wholesale gas prices have now fallen. Although this is a good sign, it isn't yet a reason to sound the all -clear. Prices are still at levels we would've considered unthinkable just a few years ago. Moreover, prices remain volatile. Nobody knows how prices will develop in the weeks and months ahead. That's why now, amid the crisis, we need to lay the groundwork and make the right decisions .\n\nSecond , we -by that I mean energy companies, national and European energy policy, and European industrial policy -must continue to work at getting better. The prosperity of Europe, and Germany in particular, is currently at stake. The energy crisis is changing our competitiveness -structurally and permanently -relative to other regions of the world. In the long term, we in the energy industry need to offset the structural supply shortfall by tapping new sources, such as more renewables and hydrogen. In the short term, we need a lot of LNG too. In addition, we need to dramatically accelerate the energy transition. 2023 must bring new impetus for investments in renewables, energy networks, and hydrogen. And above all for the right regulatory incentives so that investments in energy infrastructure in particular are worthwhile again. Policymakers and regulators in Germany must also finally get serious about reducing bureaucracy and ending the country's parochial ap proach to planning so that the necessary network expansion can succeed and renewables can really take off. E.ON is making a significant contribution to this by expanding its energy distribution networks. About 15 percent of renew able energy in Europeand fully two -thirds in Germany -is connected to our networks. We already operate 800,000 kilometers of\n\ndistribution networks in Germany alone. That would be enough to circle the earth 20 times. But the challenge is enormous: to meet the targets we will have to double the distribution networks by 2030. E.ON, for one, is ready to invest. We invested just under \u20ac4 billion to expand and digitalize our networks in 2022. And we're prepared to invest \u20ac26 billion more across Europe through 2027 to expand our network infrastructure. But to fully implement this ambitious plan, we first need the right investment conditions.\n\nBecause, third , now is the time to invest out of the crisis. Successful decarbonization will require massive investments in renewable and low -carbon energy, but, most importantly, in robust and digital energy networks. Why am I so sure about this? Because over the past three years the demand for new network connections has risen exponentially. This is due not just to new wind and solar facilities, but also to increasing electric -vehicle registrations and the rapidly growing demand in the heating sector for electric heating or cooling systems. All these issues will create immense growth opportunities for our business if we tackle them even faster now.\n\nThis will require effective investment incentives for international investors to propel the green transformation. All the more so now that our company is operating in an environment of higher interest rates on capital markets, something that so far isn't inadequately reflected in the regulatory scheme. As E.ON CEO, I'm pushing for improvements in this area as well in order to accelerate the pace of establishing infrastructure for sustainable energy. This infrastructure is needed now more urgently than ever .",

Our strategy and our focus on growth, sustainability, and digitalization put us in precisely the right position to do so. That's why we'll be successful in 2023 as well. The current year will lay an important foundation for our accelerated investment program of around \u20ac33 billion over the next five years.

Our new debt factor target of  \u2264 5.0 is also intended to reflect our confidence in E.ON's financial strength. Last year once again demonstrated clearly that the current opportunities for our entire business model are greater than ever, and now we have a unique opportunity to seize them for our benefit.\n\nThis underlines E.ON's strong position, and I look forward to working with our Management Board team and employees -and above all with you: our customers, business partners, and investors -to successfully achieve these ambitious objectives .\n\nLeo Birnbaum\n\n<!-- image -->",

Russia's war of aggression has lastingly altered Europe's previous type of energy supply and therefore posed major challenges for the Company.

It advised the Management Board in detail about the Company's management and continually monitored the Management Board's activities, assuring itself that the Company's management was legal, purposeful, and orderly. At four regular meetings it addressed all issues relevant to the Company. In addition, it carried out two written resolution procedures. On a regular basis, the shareholder representatives and employee representatives made separate preparations for these meetings with the participation of one or several members of the Management Board. All members of the Supervisory Board attended all meetings.\n\nThe Management Board regularly provided the Supervisory Board with timely and comprehensive information about significant business transactions in both written and oral form. At the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and its committees, the Supervisory Board had sufficient opportunity to actively discuss the Management Board's reports, motions, and proposed resolutions. After thoroughly examining and discussing the resolutions proposed by the Management Board, the Supervisory Board voted on them when it was required by law, the Company's Articles of Association, or the Supervisory Board's rules and procedures. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also met on a recurring basis without the Management Board being present.\n\nIn addition, there was a regular exchange of information between the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Management Board, in particular the Chairman, during the entire financial year. In the case of particularly pertinent issues, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was kept informed at all times. He likewise maintained contact with the members of the Supervisory Board outside of board meetings.",

Members of the Supervisory Board unable to attend in person were given the opportunity to attend by means of video conference. This was made use of in some instances.\n\n## Management of the Energy Crisis and Strategy Review\n\nThe Supervisory Board closely monitored the management of the challenges posed to the Company by the energy crisis against the backdrop of Russia's war of aggression. It was informed by the Management Board on an ongoing basis about the crisis's implications for the Company and provided the Management Board with detailed advice. The same applies to the strategy's refinement and implementation.\n\n## Key Topics of the Supervisory Board's Discussions\n\nCrisis -driven policy and regulatory interventions in countries in which E.ON is active constituted a key topic of the Supervisory Board's discussions. In the case of Germany, these were in particular the planned gas levy, the electricity and gas price caps, and the decisions on the temporary continued operation of Isar 2 nuclear power station. Government intervention in pricing, which was in some cases extensive, especially in Romania, was the subject of deliberations as well.\n\nIn the context of the Group's operating business, the Supervisory Board addressed at length the impact of dramatically higher commodity prices on E.ON, the business situation of the Group and its companies, national and international energy markets, as well as the currencies that are important to E.ON. It discussed E.ON SE's and the E.ON Group's asset, financial, and earnings situation, dividend policy, workforce developments, and earnings opportunities and risks. The Supervisory Board and the Management Board thoroughly discussed the E.ON Group's medium -term plan for 2023 to 2025. The Supervisory Board was provided with information on a regular basis about the Company's cybersecurity, health, (occupational) safety, and environmental performance (in particular, key accident indicators) as well as current customer numbers, customer satisfaction, and the number of apprentices.\n\n## Overview of the Attendance of Supervisory Board Members at Meetings of the Supervisory Board and Its Committees\n\n| Supervisory Board members                     | Supervisory  Board   | Executive Committee   | Audit and  Risk Committee   | Innovation and Sustainability Committee   | Nomination  Committee   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Kley, Karl -

In addition, likewise on May 11, 2022, Miroslav Pelouch was elected to succeed Monika Krebber on this committee.\n\nPages 318 and 319 of the Integrated Annual Report provide an overview of all members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Personal Remarks\n\nPermit me to conclude with a few personal remarks: This is my last shareholder letter for E.ON. I have had the privilege of leading the Supervisory Board of this outstanding company for more than seven years. We took on and accomplished a lot in those seven years: the Group's separation into E.ON and Uniper, the reorganization of E.ON, the sale of E.ON's Uniper stake to Fortum, the acquisition and integration of innogy, the appointment of Leonhard Birnbaum to succeed Johannes Teyssen as the new Chairman of the Management Board, the navigation of the Company through the Covid -19 pandemic, and the multi -faceted measures to tackle the current crisis. No, it was never dull. There was hardly any time to catch one's breath. But what remains is a sense of satisfaction about all the things that we shaped together during this time.\n\nOur equity stood at \u20ac1.3 billion in 2016 and at \u20ac21.9 billion in 2022. We recorded adjusted net income of \u20ac0.9 billion in 2016 and \u20ac2.7 billion in 2022. We paid out a dividend of \u20ac0.27 per share for the 2016 financial year and are proposing a dividend of \u20ac0.51 per share for the 2022 financial year.\n\nToday, E.ON is again in good shape.

Sustainability is the centerpiece of E.ON's strategy and -in every dimension -the standard for our actions. An integrated report provides our stakeholders with a holistic and transparent view of our financial, environmental, and social performance.\n\n## Standards\n\nThis integrated report applies to the E.ON Group as well as E.ON SE. E.ON is therefore fulfilling all requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: 'HGB'), and German Accounting Standards (German abbrevia tion 'DRS'). The combined Non -Financial Statement ('NFS') pursuant to Section \u00a7\u00a7 315b and 315c in conjunction with Sections \u00a7\u00a7 289b to 289e of the HGB is fully integrated into the Combined Group Management Report. The Group Management Report thus contains information on five aspects: the environment, employees, social matters, human rights, as well as anti-corruption and anti-bribery. The NFS also complies with the disclosure requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation . The NonFinancial Statement ('NFS') I ndex indicates where these disclosures can be found in the integrated report. Other parts of the Combined Group Management Report include Disclosures Regarding Takeovers and t he Corporate Governance Declaration. In addition , the Compensation Report is integrated into th e Annual Report.\n\nE.ON's sustainability reporting, which consists of the NFS and other sustainability disclosures, is guided by the findings of its materiality analysis and topics relevant for stakeholders. It has been prepared with reference to the GRI Standards 2021 by the Global Reporting Initiative . The GRI standards covered by the content of a chapter are displayed on the first page of the chapter. The GRI Index provides an overview. The Other Information chapter contains E.ON's disclosures regarding the Electric Utilities and Power Generators Standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB'). E.ON is committed to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact ('UNGC') and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs'). We describe our contributions to the SDGs in the Strategy chapter. Our climate -related reporting, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') as well, can be found in the chapter Other Information .\n\n## Scope\n\nThis report encompasses all subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements 2022. Any d eviations are marked accordingly . KPIbased thresholds are used to distinguish companies that do not contribute significantly to the report. The next chapter, Business Model, contains more information about the E.ON Group's structure and business segments.\n\nThe reporting period is the 2022 calendar year. For most KPIs the corresponding prior -year figure is provided to\n\nimprove comparability. Adjustments to prior -year figures of a KPI are explained in footnotes.\n\nStatements on the future development of E.ON and its subsidiaries are estimates based on information avai lable at the time of reporting. Actual results may deviate from these statements.\n\nThe report was published on March 15, 2023, and is available in German and English in pdf format. You can download the pdf version of this report at eon.com . The previous Annual Report and previous Sustainability Report were published in March 2022. You can find them and additional reports in the investor relations archive .",

The findings of these assessments provide important guidance to investors and to E.ON. They help us identify our strengths and weaknesses and further improve our performance. The Sustainable Finance chapter presents the results of sustainability ratings .\n\n## Assurance\n\nThe Combined Group Management Report is generally audited as part of the statutory audit of the financial statements. Content that is not part of the statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and is therefore excluded from the auditor's report is identified separately, as described below. For the NFS and selected additional sustainability information, a separate assurance engagement ('Sustainability Assurance') was also performed by KPMG AG in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ('ISAE') 3000 (Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('IAASB'). The audit assurance applied to the different contents is clarified in the report by means of various symbols.\n\nSymbols next to headings [H2] apply until the next heading of the same level of hierarchy. Sections within the same chapter that were audited with a different assurance may be marked separately. This is done in longer sections by means of symbols next to the subheadings [H3] which apply until the next heading of the same level of hierarchy. In addition, individual sections or KPIs that are subject to a different audit assurance may be marked separ ately.\n\nThe corresponding contents are marked as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNot part of the statutory audit, audited with reasonable assurance as part of the Sustainability Assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000.\n\n- Not part of the statutory audit, audited with limited assurance as part of the Sustainability Assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000; individual text passages are indicated by \u25ba\u25c4 .\n- Not part of the statutory audit, unaudited; individual text passages are indicated by \u203a \u2039.\n\nPrioryear figures and quantified changes from the prior year included in sections marked as audited are audited with limited assurance.\n\nThe precise scope of the audit is described in the Other Information section in the Independent A uditor's Report and in the report on the management review of sustainability information.",

The Group's core business is divided into two segments: Energy Networks and Customer Solutions. Corporate functions and equity interests managed directly by E.ON SE are reported under Corp orate Functions/Other. Non -strategic operations are reported under NonCore Business until the end of 2022 and effective 2023 under Corporate Functions/Other.\n\n## Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate Functions' main task is to lead the E.ON Group. This involves charting E.ON's strategic course and managing and funding its existing business portfolio. Corporate Functions' tasks include optimizing E.ON's overall business across countries and markets from a financial, strategic, and risk perspective and conducting stakeholder management.\n\n## Energy Networks\n\nThis segment consists of E.ON's power and gas distribution networks and related activities. It is subdivided into three regional markets: Germany, Sweden, and East -Central Europe/Turkey (which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Croat ia, Slovakia, and the stake in Enerjisa Enerji in Turkey, which is accounted for using the equity method). This segment's main tasks include operating its power and gas networks safely and reliably, carrying out all necessary maintenance and repairs, and e xpanding its power and gas networks, which frequently involves adding customer connections and the connection of renewable energy generation assets.\n\n## Customer Solutions\n\nThis segment serves as the platform for working with E.ON's customers to actively shape Europe's energy transition. This includes supplying customers in Europe (excluding Turkey) with power, gas (conventional and green), and heat and providing them with sustainable solutions that enhance their energy efficiency, energy autonomy, and eMobility. E.ON's activities are tailored to the individual needs of customers across all categories: residential, small and medium -sized enterprises, large commercial and industrial, sales partners, and public entities. The E.ON Group's main presence in this business is in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Nordics (for example, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Poland, and Slovakia. In addition, Energy Infrastructure Solutions engages in activities aimed at decarbonizing commercial customers, cities, and communities, such as sustainable city solutions and district heating.\n\n## Non-Core Business\n\nThis segment consists of the E.ON Group's non -strategic activities. This applies to the operation and dismantling of nuclear power stations in Germany (which is managed by the PreussenElektra unit) and the generation business in Turkey. Effective 2023, Non -Core Business is disclosed under Corporate Functions/Other.\n\n## ESG Materiality and Stakeholder\n\nEngagement\n\n## ESG Materiality\n\nGRI 3-1, GRI 3-2\n\nE.ON has conducted an annual materiality analysis since 2006. The purpose is to identify and evaluate the sustainability topics that are most important to the Company and its stakeholders. This report contains information on the topics whose materiality the analysis deemed to be particularly high. It also addresses less material sustainability topics. E.ON thus aims to meet the different\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpectations of stakeholders as well as the requirements of environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') rankings and ratings. We provide an overview of the material and other topics in the Non -Financial Statement ('NFS') Index .\n\n## Identification of Material Topics\n\nE.ON conducted its materiality analysis in 2022 in accordance with the requirements of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive ('NFRD'). The requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') were taken into account, but not applied. We applied the double materiality principle: we considered the financial perspective as well as the impact perspective. The process had four steps, which are described below:\n\n## Step One: Topic Identification a nd Collection\n\nE.ON first gathered information and evidence on potentially material topics. We consulted a variety of sources, including regulations, reporting standards as well as statements from customers, competitors, investors, and non -governmental organizations ('NGOs'). We used this to create an overview of possible material topics. These were then compared with our existing material topics, collated, and reduced to a common denominator. The basis for this was an evaluation that co r relates a topic's frequency of mention to its importance for the indus try. Experts from Sustainability, Group Accounting , and Investor Relations divisions reviewed and finally agreed on a short list of E.ON's potentially material topics.\n\n## Step Two: Impact Perspective\n\nE.ON analyzed the impact perspective by surveying NGOs, research institutes, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. We gave them a questionnaire containing the topics identified in step one and asked them to rate them. The questionnaire's findings were then examined in greater depth in stakeholder interviews.

Another workshop was then held to assess and validate the financial materiality of the topics identified. Representatives from the aforementioned functions -S ustainability, Investor Relations, Group Accounting, and Group Risk -participated as well.\n\n## Step Four: Materiality Threshold\n\nE.ON finalized the list of topics by defining a common materiality threshold for the impact and financial perspectives. Only topics that exceeded it were considered material. To determine them, we held a third workshop consisting of the above -mentioned participants. The findings were then presented to the Sustainability Council, which approved E.ON's materiality analysis for 2022.\n\n## Material Topics\n\nThe findings of the materiality analysis for 2022 are listed below. The highest relevance from a financial and impact perspective was assigned to the following three topics:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate -change mitigation\n- \u00b7 Energy affordability\n- \u00b7 Reliable energy supply.\n\nThe material topic of climate -change mitigation also encompasses customer solutions that mitigate climate change.  Since both aspects -general climate -change mitigation and customer solutions that mitigate climat e change -are extensive, they are\n\npresented in separate chapters in the Integrated Annual Report 2022.\n\nThe chapters of this report provide information on E.ON's approach to managing its material topics and outline the Company's progress in the reporting year. The description of the management approach is based on GRI 3 -3, Management of material topics.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nGRI 2-28, GRI 2-29\n\nE.ON continually seeks dialogue with its various stakeholders. We want to listen to and understand their points of view and also to talk to them openly about the potential short - and longterm impacts of our business activities. This is an important objective of our daily work at the local, national, and European level. A stakeholder is any person who or any group that has an interest in a company. Stakeholder engagement is thus a core process of E.ON's corporate governance. The dialogue formats we choose vary by stakeholder and topic. They range from information campaigns and discussion forums with associations and NGOs to face -toface discussions and lobbying. For example, E.ON is actively involved in the global investor initiative CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), works with the United Nations Environment Programme ('UNEP'), and supports the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Furthermore, since 2021 E.ON has been part of the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance), which is committed to biodiversity and the protection of tropical forests. More information on CDP and the LEAF Coalition can be found in the 'Climate Protection' chapter. E.ON is also a member of SolarPower Europe, a European association of energy suppliers and solar companies. The Solar Stewardship Initiative ('SSI') was set up as part of this association. Its aim is to create more transparency for solar -power supply chains and to ensure compliance with human rights.\n\nE.ON acti vely participates in policy debates on issues that affect the Company. We use a variety of channels for this, including lobbying, media interviews with our executives, and their appearances as public speakers. In addition, policymakers and regulators frequently invite E.ON to provide its technical and energy expertise as part of their decision -making processes. The Company offers its expertise proactively as well. This type of advocacy are important because the energy sector is significantly influenced by policy and regulatory decisions. In 2022 we assisted the German federal government, particularly by supporting its plans for tackling the energy crisis. E.ON CEO Leonhard Birnbaum was a member of the independent Expert Commission Gas and Heat, which was commissioned by the German government to develop proposals that can relieve households and businesses from the sharp rise in gas prices. Furthermore, E.ON takes part in discussions on energy, environmental, and climate policy in a variety of other forums. For example, E.ON CFO Marc Spieker was a member of the European Commission's Platform on Sustainable Finance until the end of October 2022. In addition, Leonhard Birnbaum is part of the European CEO Alliance, an alliance of EU -wide business leaders who discuss ways to provide additional support to the EU Green Deal. Effective November 21, 2022, Leonhard Birnbaum was appointed acting president of Eurelectric, the association of the European electricity industry. Eurelectric is an umbrella organization representing more than 3,500 European companies active in electricity generation, distribution, and supply. Direct members of Eurelectric are the national associations, including the German Association of the Energy and Water Industries (German abbreviation: 'BDEW'), Swedenergy, and Energy UK.\n\n\u203a The Climate Advocacy and Associations Report provides an overview of E.ON's lobbying approach as well as the associations and initiatives which the Company is part of and the key positions it holds in conjunction with its efforts to propel the energy transition. All of E.ON's lobbying activities and dialogue formats comply with national and European laws and guidelines on representing corporate interests and responsible lobbying. \u2039",

They enable companies to shar e information about climate protection, customer needs, and industry trends and to represen t shared interests to policymakers and regulators. Examples of these memberships include:\n\n- \u00b7 German Association of Energy and Water Industries (Germ an abbreviation: 'BDEW'): through the BDEW E.ON is also represented in two European trade associations, Eurelectric and Eurogas.\n- \u00b7 German Industry Initiative for Energy Efficiency (Deutsche Unternehmensinitiative Energieeffizienz, or 'DENEFF'): a multi -industry network of companies and organizations dedicated to enhancing energy efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Bitkom : through this industry initiative for a digital economy the Company is also represented in the Federal Association of German Industry (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) and its European umbrella organization, Businesseurope .\n- \u00b7 E.ON executives take part in the Economic Council of the CDU e.V. and the Economic Forum of the SPD e.V .\n- \u00b7 European Distribution System Operators for Smart Grids ('EDSO for Smart Grids'): European association promoting smart grids and the digitalization of the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 Energy UK: a trade association for energy in the United Kingdom.\n- \u00b7 Swedenergy: a private association of companies involved in electricity production, sale, and trading in Swe den.\n- \u00b7 The Romanian Federation of Associations of Energy Utilities : a federation of energy suppliers in Roman ia.\n\n## NonCore Business: Stakeholder Dialogue on Reliable Operations and Plant Dismantling\n\nE.ON subsidiary PreussenElektra is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of its nuclear power plants ('NPPs'). Ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is essential. PreussenElektra communicates with a broad spectrum of stakeholders through press releases and briefings. The company also uses events and forums to speak directly with its stakeholders and benefit from their feedback. The aim of all these measures is to provide transparent information and build trust.\n\nIn view of the discussion about the possible continued operation of NPPs, PreussenElektra enhanced its dialogue with local stakeholders at Isar NPP. PreussenElektra also conducted transparent public relations by increasing its online communications and maintaining an active dia logue with national media.\n\nDialogue will also remain important during NPPs' decommissioning and dismantling. In 2022 E.ON held press events at all its NPPs. Annual power plant talks with key local stakeholders took place in the fall as well. Some plants also have dialogue groups for nearby residents, in which PreussenElektra also participated in 2022. People who live near Brokdorf, Isar, Grohnde, and Grafenrheinfeld NPPs were given the opportunity to visit the plants on selected dates.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## 2022: New Challenges and a Robust Strategy\n\nThe turbulence of 2022, triggered by the Russia -Ukraine war, presents the world with major new challenges. High and significantly more volatile commodity prices, rising interest rates, inflation, and additional strains on supply chains already disrupted by the Covid -19 pandemic created uncertainty. As part of a periodic review, the updated strategic course the E.ON Group set in 2021 was critically scrutinized in view of these factors. Individual countries -and not just their policymakers -want energy\n\nsecurity and energy autonomy based primarily on decentralized and renewable power generation and distribution. This will require resilient and digital energy infrastructure; and that is exactly what E.ON's power and gas networks represent. Supply security will be at the forefront. The new growth strategy E.ON formulated in 2021founded on sustainability, growth, and digitalization -is part of this future. E.ON's strategy has proven itself to be robust, even amid disruptive events.\n\nIn t he Energy Networks segment, E.ON is systematically implementing its strategy in the context of current developments. Investments in the 2022 financial year went mainly toward network expansion and modernization in line with the needs of the energy transiti on. A significant part of Europe's renewables capacity is connected to the E.ON Group's networks. These networks are the backbone of the energy transition, which can only succeed if they grow at the same rate as the demand for connections.\n\nThe Customer Solutions segment -considering the significant demand for smart solutions and products to decarbonize households and industry -is proving to be solid. This demonstrates that many people want to take their energy supply into their own hands. Prosumers are becoming a reality faster than many expected. E.ON is Europe's largest provider of energy solutions for decarbonizing households.\n\n- \u25ba E.ON's broad range of products and services enables its customers and partners to displace more than 100 million metric tons of CO2e annually. \u25c4\n\nAlongside the increase in residential demand we also saw greater demand for decarbonizing entire city districts as part of district heating and cooling projects. Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') significantly increased its earnings and investments c ompared with the prior year. It also developed and acquired future -oriented projects.",

The current crisis highlights and reinforces the importance and necessity of change; it must be further accelerated. After many disputes about the right course, a consensus is emerging between policymakers, companies, and society -both in Germany and in Europe. The European Commission's revised targets for speeding up renewables expansion will further increase the demand to connect these facilities to networks and thus also the need to expand network capacity. The anticipated increase in demand for hydrogen to replace coal, gas, and oil in industry is ambitious and will also require massive investment in energy infrastructure. All this will offer us new opportunities and confirms E.ON's strategic course.\n\n## Connecting Everyone to Good Energy\n\nEurope's energy transition is irreversible and gaining pace, even amid the current market situation. This poses new challenges for the energy industry but also creates tremendous opportunities. E.ON is a leading network operator, and its Customer Solutions segments supplies roughly 48 million customers (including customers in Turkey and of ZSE in Slovakia) with energy . This positions us better than any other energy company in Europe to profoundly shape the new era of green energy and to play a leading role in the distributed, zero -carbon energy world of the future. Our strategy has three key components -sustainability, di gitalization, and growth -on which we will focus our human and financial resources in the years ahead. Sustainability is the core of E.ON's strategy and -in all dimensions -will be the guiding principle for our future actions. E.ON intends to become climate -n eutral itself, and helping our customers reach their climate targets will be a key growth driver.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nE.ON's strategy fits seamlessly with the European Union's decarbonization agenda. Europe's distribution networks -E.ON's biggest business -are wh ere the energy transition is happening. The investments necessary to upgrade, expand, and digitalize\n\nthese networks in the decade ahead are estimated at over \u20ac425 billion. This amount of investment is roughly equal to the size of Belgium's entire economy. The European Commission's desire to accelerate this expansion will be an additional driver.\n\n\u203a E.ON's strategy fits with two of the EU Green Deal's programs: the Horizon Europe program (which will provide about \u20ac15 billion of funding through 2027 for climate, energy, and mobility projects) and the Innovation Fund (which will mobilize about \u20ac10 billion through 2030 to help low -carbon technologies become market -ready). \u2039\n\nMany of these projects and technologies are relevant for E.ON's customer solutions business. To seize the growth opportunities in its core business, E.ON plans to invest a total of roughly \u20ac 33 billion from 202 3 to 2027 , of which around \u20ac2 6 billion will go toward energy networks and \u20ac 7 billion toward customer solutions.\n\n- \u25ba This investment program aims to be fully aligned with the EU Taxonomy; 8 2 percent of E.ON's investments in its core business in 2022 fell within the taxonomy's scope; 98 percent of these investments are green . \u25c4\n\nMore than half of the funding for these investments will be raised through the issuance of green bonds. E.ON's updated strategy thus also caters to capital markets' increasing interest in sustainable investments. More information about E.ON's disclosures in line with the EU taxonomy for the 2022 financial year can be found in the 'EU Taxonomy' chapter; the 'Sustainable Finance' chapter contains more information about green bonds.\n\nClimate protection will be a key driver of E.ON's future growth. The Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') validated E.ON's climate targets in May 2022 . They are consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C above preindustrial levels. In addition, E.ON pledges for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions to achieve climate neutrality by 2040 (and to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by roughly 75 perce nt by 2030). E.ON intends for its Scope 3 emissions to be\n\nclimate -neutral by 2050 (and to reduce them by about 50 percent by 2030). All reductions are relative to 2019. These objectives set a course that is both ambitious and viable: a reduction path consistently aligned with the new energy world in keeping with E.ON's strategy. In addition, in 2022 E.ON began to voluntarily offset emissions it is currently unable to avoid. Offsets help fund measures that reduce or prevent carbon emissions outside E.ON's value chain. E.ON's flagship offsetting program is its partnership, begun in 2021, with the LEAF Coalition, which stands for L owering E missions by Accelerating Forest Finance. LEAF offsets help protect tropical forests and manage them sustainably. E.ON's LEA F program will initially run through year -end 2027.\n\nESG aspects are systematically embedded into E.ON's central control and management processes. In addition, each business unit's management team is responsible for taking action to enhance sustainability a nd to meet the unit's sustainability targets. This decentralized approach enables the units to contribute to E.ON's Group -wide targets for issues like climate protection and corporate governance, while also tailoring their actions to their specific needs. Each unit has sustainability staff who reinforce awareness, coordinate projects and initiatives, and monitor progress toward targets. They share information at regular intervals with our Sustainability Council and the E.ON Group's Sustainability team.\n\n## Digi talization\n\nDigitalization will be a cornerstone of the energy landscape of the future. The transition toward a distributed, volatile, and networked energy world will be accompanied by increasing complexity that can only be managed through comprehensive digitalization. Digitalization is thus an important lever in E.ON's growth strategy and the basis for generating additional value in its core business over the long term. E.ON's objective is to become a fully digital energy company and to fundamentally transform its products, processes, and services into data -driven and highly networked solutions. Our digital transformation is proceeding along four strategic pathways: optimizing internal operations, engaging",

The centerpiece of our digital transformation is a common technology platform ('CTP') for the entire Group. The CTP will serve as the basis for standardizing and harmonizing all applications in the E.ON Group necessary for the energy transition. It will enable us to develop new digital energy solutions while maintaining the highest security standards.\n\nThe foundation of E.ON One, a new subsidiary for digital solutions, has enabled the E.ON Group to pursue the objective of offering and operating innovative IT solutions for the external market and E.ON Group companies. E.ON One's portfolio will be formed by targeted investments in E.ON's own innovations and in startups. This will make it possible to smartify networks and render energy consumption more sustainable. E.ON One focuses on three business areas: grid management, grid operations, and energy management solutions. These areas form the basis of a successful energy transition. For example, E.ON One offers a wide range of energy management solutions that give customers more transparency about their consumption and automatically optimize consumption and generation.\n\nEnergy Networks' top priorities include standardization, smartification, and the development of new digital solutions, all with the highest cybersecurity standards. Digitalization helps E.ON operate its networks even more efficiently and optimally manage t he growing proportion of power from renewable generating facilities. The development of digital solutions like smart eMobility charging solutions as well as new services on both sides of standard residential meters and smart energy meters are also part of E.ON's growth strategy.\n\n## Growth\n\nE.ON's core business consists of two segments: Energy Networks and Customer Solutions. E.ON operates power and gas networks in various regions of Europe and offers a broad range of customer solutions. The two businesses complement each other amid the\n\ntransformation of global energy systems. They are also clear growth businesses that benefit from the sustainable transformation of various customers and industrial sectors. This transformation expands E.ON's business opportunities as well. And our growth strategy fits seamlessly with Europe's decarbonization ambitions. Ongoing renewables expansion and the increasing challenges this poses for power networks will require investments of more than \u20ac425 billion to transform electricit y distribution networks. The growth in the aggregate energy demand of E.ON's customer groups is estimated to increase by more than 100 percent between 2020 and 2050. A sustainable transformation of the economy is necessary for this as well . E.ON is aiming for earnings growth in both the Energy Networks and C ustomer S olutions segments, supported by continual efficiency improvements. The measures in this area focus primarily on achieving operational excellence. We are likewise aware that our growth strategy c an only be implemented if it is accompanied by changes within our organization, such as cultural change, diversity, and education . Comprehensive measures to propel these changes are therefore integral to our strategy.\n\n## Growth in the Energy Networks Segment\n\nThe transition to a new, sustainable, and connected energy world will require considerable investments in physical and digital assets. As stated above, this applies above all to the Energy Networks segment, which is the backbone of a successful energy transition. Ongoing renewables expansion in particular will require grids to grow at a similar pace. New network connections and connected load will increase sharply amid the energy transition owing to changes in customer behavior. The energy transition alon e therefore represents an unprecedented growth opportunity for E.ON, an opportunity that is being further accelerated by the current developments in Europe's energy system and momentum for the energy transition. Consequently, this growth will be accompanied by the suitable and sensible digitalization of networks because th ey are a key component of E.ON's growth strategy and a prerequisite for the implementation of the energy and climate transition in distribution networks. The use of smart -\n\ngrid technology like smart energy meters and smart transformer stations, the integration of external data, the standardization of construction and operating processes, and the use of a central data platform all offer considerable potential. Where necessary for technical reasons and economically feasible, E.ON will acquire the capability to monitor and control its distribution networks across all voltage levels in order to optimize their operation. Sensors and smart energy metering and control technology will enable real -time control of distributed generation and consumption.\n\nE.ON's existing gas networks will continue to play an important role in the transformation of the energy system. Going forward, E.ON will also, where legally possible and economically sensible, make its existing gas networks hydrogen -ready. These investments will help pave the way toward climate -neutral gas networks.\n\nE.ON's capabilities along with the above -average efficiency of its network operations will enable it to lead the necessary transformation of the energy system. Eight of E.ON's nine distribution system operators ('DSOs') in Germany have an efficiency rating of 100 percent, with three of them earning a super efficiency bonus. All E.ON DSOs surpass the indust ry average.\n\nThis is among the reasons why E.ON is one of Europe's leading DSOs. E.ON has a regulated asset base ('RAB') of \u20ac3 6.4 billion, and its regulated business generates a large share of its EBITDA. E.ON's strategic objective is therefore to remain Europe's leading energy and infrastructure partner. E.ON plans to direct a large portion of investments during the 2023 -2027 planning period toward network expansion and a variety of network projects. The Forecast Report co ntains details about planned investments.\n\n## Growth in the Customer Solutions Segment\n\nE.ON's Customer Solutions segment focuses on the energy services business and the Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business's activities in distributed energy.",

This is a scalable business model with comparatively low capital requirements and focuses on private households and small and medium -sized enterprises. E.ON's objective for this business is to r etain its roughly 48 million customers across Europe (including customers in Turkey and at ZSE in Slovakia) in the long term by offering them a sustainable energy supply and energy solutions and thus reducing their environmental footprint and by helping Eu rope to reach its energy conservation targets, particularly residential customers' gas consumption. So that this objective can be achieved at competitive costs, E.ON systematically pursues digitalization, which promotes optimal operating efficiency and superior customer satisfaction and loyalty (customer relationship management) as well as cross -selling opportunities. E.ON's solutions business focuses primarily on the Future Energy Home ('FEH'), a portfolio of distributed energy systems for households. They include self -generation of green solar power, energy storage, heat, and eMobility solutions. The European Commission's solar strategy for the EU, which includes the target of doubling Europe's solar power capacity by 2025, will serve as an additional growth driver. The expansion of suitable eMobility infrastructure is another key strategic priority. The eMobility market is undergoing change and is characterized by robust growth: at least 15 million electric vehicles are expected to be registered in Germany by 2030. Charging infrastructure, by contrast, is expanding at a slower pace. E.ON therefore believes the near term is the time for rapid growth activities, because all attractive locations for charging infrastructure will presumably have been allocated in the years ahead. Our objective is to enlarge our current market position and become one of Europe's leading operators of charging infrastructure by 2030.\n\n\u25ba In 2022 E.ON sold 20,417 charging points for residential and business customers in many European countries . \u25c4\n\nEIS's activities encompass innovative energy solutions that help cities, municipalities, and industrial customers achieve their climate targets cost -effectively. E.ON aims for its EIS business unit\n\nto achieve additional growth and become the preferred tran sformation partner for sustainable, innovative energy solutions. EIS's core business consists of a portfolio of solutions for embedded power, heat, and cooling plants as well as solutions for energy efficiency and decarbonization along with other energy services. E.ON sees green hydrogen in particular as a key strategic growth opportunity in this space over the medium term and has established a hydrogen business unit to meet industrial customers' increasing demand for green gases in the future. E.ON assumes that by 2040 the demand for hydrogen will extend across the industrial, mobility, heat, and electricity sectors. In addition, hydrogen will play an essential role in the climate -neutral energy system of the future. In the short term, E.ON will partner with its customers to move forward with hydrogen projects that are already under way in quintessential industrial regions like the Ruhr district and, over the medium term, scale up the business unit internationally. This includes E.ON's strategic partnership with Australian hydrogen pioneer FFI to develop ways of importing large quantities of green hydrogen to Germany. Our international footprint in Europe gives us an optimal platform for future hydrogen clusters in the North Sea region. Currently, E.ON is involved in over 50 projects along the entire hydrogen value chain to make green hydrogen available to business customers and municipalities.\n\nE.ON is thus superbly positioned to propel the energy transition and satisfy the increasing demand for sustainable solutions. All business units will benefit from robust demand growth for green power and gas across all sectors (households, transportation, buildings, and industry).\n\n## Commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\u203a The United Nations' S ustainable Development Goals ('SDGs') of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future. Adopted in 2015, the 17 SDGs and 169 subgoals address a wide range of global challenges. We recognize the SDGs' importance and fully support them. Our\n\nManagement Board underscored this support by issuing a self -commitment to the SDGs in June 2018. E.ON's core business activities enable it to play a considerable role in fostering the SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). All of E.ON's other contributions to the UN SDGs can be found in the SDG Index. \u2039\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## F inance Strategy\n\nThe section of the Combined Group Management Report ent itled Financial Situation as well as the E.ON on Capital Markets chapter contain explanatory information about E.ON's finance strategy.\n\n## People Strategy\n\nThe sections of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Working Conditions and Diversity and Inclusion contain explanatory information about the main components of E.ON's people strategy as well as statements about diversity at E.ON.\n\n## Innovation\n\n## Innovations as Drivers for Climate-Neutral and Affordable Energy Solutions\n\nThe energy industry is currently facing a multitude of significant challenges, while at the same time the transformation of the energy system is in full swing. In these fast -moving and disruptive times, E.ON continues to actively shape change. More than ever, E.ON sees itself as a thought leader that views change as an opportunity and that uses innovation as a catalyst for growth. E.ON is living up to i t s responsibilities in the current situation in particular by developing new, innovative products and services that save energy, reduce carbon emissions, and address the issue of energy affordability.",

In addition to the numerous innovation activities in decentralized o rganizational units throughout the Group, E.ON has a central Innovation team that further developed its 360 -degree innovation approach in 2022. This approach involves developing innovations inhouse as well as working with partners worldwide: from a wide r ange of collaborations with universities, institutions, and companies to global startups and thought leaders. It enables E.ON to pursue its three innovation objectives of continually generating innovation projects, developing new business models for its cu stomers in all operating businesses, and propelling the development of disruptive innovations in which E.ON sees the potential to set new market standards.\n\n## The Continuous Initiation of Projects Ensures that the Innovation Pipeline Is Always Full\n\nContinuous idea generation, swift validation of new innovation concepts, and the implementation of innovation projects are the basis for lastingly successful innovation work.\n\nE.ON views applied energy research with leading scientific institutions as a key to climate neutrality. Its long -standing partnership with the E.ON Energy Research Center ('ERC') at RWTH Aachen University is particularly noteworthy in this regard. In 2022 E.ON placed its focus on the development of new research programs on the topics of Sustainable Decentralized Energy Systems and The Future of Heating and Cooling Supply. E.ON's network in the academic world extends far beyond its collaboration with Aachen University and encompasses international scientific institutions as well.\n\nIn 2022 E.ON further expanded its long -standing North American network. It uses collaborations such as those with Stanford University, the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership ('GSEP'), and Free Electrons, a leading accelerator, to work with global partners from these networks to identify electrification trends and\n\nleverage synergies and thus to accelerate decarbonization and electrification.\n\nProgress was made with Stanford University students on satellite -based classification of building energy efficiency, while the collaboration with Power to Hydrogen and Simerse AI linked two more U.S. -based startups directly to E.ON's core business. To enable industrial customers reduce their natural gas consumption by using hydrogen, E.ON is developing pioneering reversible electr olyzers across a number of E.ON businesses in the Power to Hydrogen project with four international partners. This new technology is expected to reduce the cost of producing hydrogen and of using it flexibly. Simerse AI is helping E.ON extend its leading p osition in the development of innovative solutions for the network business. An innovative approach to training artificial intelligence enables it to test image -based maintenance processes that use robots and drones to detect and fix defects in critical ut ility equipment faster and more effectively.\n\nThese are two more solutions implemented as part of Free Electrons, an accelerator program jointly founded by E.ON and leading global energy utilities. Together with these partners, E.ON initiated more than 20 pilot projects with 15 globally leading startups in 2022. The accelerator program focuses not only on collaboration between startups and energy utilities, but also on direct exchange between industry leaders.\n\nE.ON successfully expanded its collaboration with startups in Europe as well. One example is Dabbel, a startup that makes an important contribution toward climate neutrality by optimizing energy consumption in buildings while significantly reducing their operators' energy costs. Dabbel's solution enables average energy savings of 26 percent by optimizing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technology without installing additional hardware. E.ON City Energy Solutions ('CES') and Avacon in Germany and E.ON Control Solutions in the United Kingdom worked together closely in 2022 to test the solution and initiate partnership models.\n\nIn addition, the open innovation format of the E.ON Grid Startup Challenge, in which all 18 E.ON network companies participated, yielded seven new pilot projects with startups. Alongside digitalization, t he topics included ecological powerline pathway management and the resilience of network infrastructure. Hamburg -based startup Repath, for example, is conducting a project with Schleswig -Holstein Netz AG to help identify loc al climate risks and design adaptation measures.\n\n## New Business Models Secure Future Business and Pave the Way for Additional Growth\n\nA permanently changing world, opportunities created by the use of new technologies, and our customers' continually evolving wishes require an extended approach to innovation. In addition to successfully managing its existing business, E.ON needs new business models to provide the basis for its future business. Sustainability, digitalization, and growth are also the principles that guide every aspect of E.ON's development of innovations. The central Innovation team's collaboration with E.ON business units focuses on identifying customer needs or the customer problem to be solved and developing a viable and promising business model . This enables innovation experts with years of experience to develop products faster and more efficiently and jointly bring them to market maturity. In 2022, 17 projects with anticipated sales totaling \u20ac224 million over the next five years were handed ove r to E.ON operating units. Examples of these innovations include the BiclEVer eMobility project, the Elna energy home solution, and a solution that uses smart heating control technology to enable commercial customers to conserve energy.\n\n## BiclEVer: an Electricity Storage System on Four Wheels\n\nElectromobility is considered an important building block for the successful implementation of the energy transition. For this core area of E.ON's business, its innovation teams developed a new process that enables bi -directional charging. In 2022 E.ON joined with BMW to launch a pilot project called Bi -clEVer in the Munich",

The project primarily addresses the question of how an electric vehicle ('EV') battery, in conjunction with a photovoltaic system, can be sensibly used as an electricity storage device in households. Unlike with conventional EV charging, with bi -directional charging electricity does not flow solely toward the battery, but can, as needed, also be fed back into the home's energy network.\n\n## Elna Makes Energy Consumption Transparent and Invites People to Conserve Energy\n\nAnother example is the Elna project launched in Sweden in 2022. Sweden -a European leader in the introduction of smart energy meters -is considered an ideal market for the launch of such a product. Elna is an additional feature of the My E.ON app for residential consumers. The new functionality displays a home's energy consumption in real time. This free smart service provides detailed insights and itemized data on household consumption i n up to 14 categories, including standby appliances, heat pumps, washing machines, and EV chargers. In addition, Elna offers many other options for making energy -consumption decisions that conserve energy and thus reduce energy costs. After a successful te st phase, E.ON plans to gradually increase the number of customers in Sweden. Rolling out the service in other European countries also remains an ambitious goal.\n\n## Using Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Gas Consumption in Existing Buildings\n\nIntelligent Heating Control ('ICH') is an ad hoc solution for outdoortemperature -based heating systems that E.ON developed and tested in 2022 in collaboration with its partner Lemonbeat. The solution can reduce the gas consumption and thus the carbon emissions of a heating unit in an apartment building by up to 30 percent. The ICH system's effectiveness was demonstrated after its simply plug -andplay installation in two identical multifamily dwellings. The system enables property owners to retrofit heating systems that have not been modernized. The solution's artificial intelligence learns the heating system's characteristics and uses a\n\nsimulated outdoor temperature to provide fully automated control of the heating system in response to demand in real time. In addition to delivering cost savings, this innovation builds a bridge toward climate -neutral heating.\n\n## Scale Hubs Propel Innovations that Can Set New Market Standards\n\nThe development of disruptive innovations is much discussed at E.ON. The work of the experts from the central Innovation team includes developing new business models whose concepts are based on new technological applications whose degree of maturity does not yet permit immediate market launch. Some of these innovations demonstrate above -average potential, both in terms of their commercial promise and their ability to develop new market standards.\n\nE.ON combines the development of such disruptive business models in scale hubs. The Group focuses in particular on propelling disruptive innovations as part of its innovation portfolio, without at the same time developing new approaches that call its existing business into question .\n\n## Innovative Energy Community Pilot Project in Tenerife\n\nThe Adeje Verde pilot project that E.ON launched in 20 22 represents the first energy community of its kind in Europe. It uses an innovative approach to citizen participation to create a community that enables its residents and local institutions to generate, share, and collectively use renewable energy. The pi lot project's objective is to provide all citizens of Adeje with access to solar energy in their immediate neighborhood, becoming role models for a fast -growing energy community. The Canary Islands has set the target of meeting all its energy needs with renewables by 2040. Spain is a pioneer in new energy regulation and thus the ideal place for a pilot project to serve as a blueprint for Europe -wide approaches.\n\nIn October 2022 the Clean Energy for EU Islands Secretariate recognized Adeje Verde's groundbreaking work by selecting it as one of three finalists of the #CE4EUIslands Game Changer Award.\n\nThe central Innovation team's 360 -degree approach has created an E.ONwide innovation platform. It makes its expertise and experience available to all E.ON units and thus serves as a perpetual innovation engine for the E.ON Group, transforming ideas from the drawing board into tangible value for the Company. The central Innovation team supports both the future of E.ON on its growth and sustainability course, and, in particular, makes the lives of E.ON customers better, more sustainable, and simpler.\n\n## Management Control System\n\nE.ON aims to further drive the sustainable path of the Company and the European energy transition in the digital age. Following our guiding princ iple 'Connecting Everyone To Good Energy,' we are writing the next chapter of our company history. In doing so, the long -term and sustainable increase in shareholder value remains the focus of our strategy, which is geared toward sustainability, digitalization, and growth.\n\nA uniform Group -wide planning and controlling system is used for the value -based management of the Group as a whole and its individual businesses. This system forms the basis for a uniform mindset Group -wide, while at the same time allow ing targeted steering impulses for individual business units.\n\n## E.ON's Management System\n\nEffective the 2022 financial year, adjusted EBITDA, investments, and earnings per share based on adjusted net income ('EPS') have been the most significant indicators for managing our aspired growth. The use of additional key financial and non -financial performance indicators is intended to ensure that our growth is in line with the various interests of our stakeholders and enable a holistic view of our performance. In particular, we focus on our customers, employees, shareholders, and bondholders, always in",

Including key non -financial indicators explicitly anchors sustainability indicators in particular in the ongoing management of our businesses.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the key performance indicators used for management purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the management system, the compensation system for the Management Board is also designed to support the implementation of our strategy and thus the long -term success of\n\nE.ON through the sustainable, long -term, and value -oriented management of the Group. For this reason, the compensation of the members of the Management Board has also been linked to the development of selected key performance indicators. The new Management Board compensation system has been in place since January 2022.\n\n## Most Significant Key Performance Indicators\n\nWith our focus on long -term, sustainable, and value -oriented growth, the most significant key performance indicators are the main metrics for internal management and the assessment of our business development and thus also the cornerstones of our forecast.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is an earnings figure before interest income and income taxes that has been adjusted to exclude non -operating effects. The adjustments include net book gains, certain restructuring expenses, the mark -tomarket valuation of derivatives, and other non -operating earnings. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA is the indicator of sustainable earnings capacity and the appropriate key figure for determining the performance of our business.\n\nInvestments are equal to investments in property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and share investments shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Investments are the engine for the future growth and digitalization of E.ON's business as well as decarbonization. As a reflection of our strategy, they therefore continue to be a key indicator for managing our activities.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share ('EPS') is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the financial year. In addition to operating earnings, depreciation and amortization, interest income, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests are included and likewise adjusted to exclude non -operating effects. This allows a holistic assessment of\n\nthe earnings situation from the perspective of the shareholders of E.ON SE.\n\n## Significant Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn order to suitably take into account the interests of our stakeholders in addition to our focus on growth, our manageme nt system also includes other significant key performance indicators. As a customer -oriented company, the ability to acquire new customers and retain existing ones is crucial to our success. Net Promoter Score ('NPS') measures customers' willingness to rec ommend E.ON to a friend or colleague. The attractiveness of our company for investors is reflected in total shareholder return ('TSR') and dividend per share ('DPS'), which is part of TSR.\n\nWe have made sustainability the core of our corporate strategy. In everything we do, we keep in mind the consequences of our actions. The progression of our carbon footprint, the frequency of serious incidents and fatalities ('SIF'), and the proportion of female managers are thus significant key performance indicators an d part of our management system. In addition, our ESG ratings are incorporated into our management system. This provides a comprehensive assessment of our actions with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters .\n\nSolid financing of our business activities is of great importance to realize our aspired long -term and sustainable growth in line with the fulfillment of our financial ambitions. For this reason, cash -conversion rate, which is an indicator of E.ON' ability to transform operating earni ngs into cash inflows, and debt factor, which is a proxy for our capital structure and ratings, are significant key figures in our management system. In addition, ROCE is included in the management system as a key performance indicator to assess the efficiency of capital employed.\n\n## Other Key Performance Indicators\n\nAlongside the performance indicators described above, other financial and non -financial indicators play a role in the success of",

The use of conventional energy results in the emission of greenhouse gases ('GHG'). Renewable and low -carbon energy generation along with efficient energy use play a key role in reducing emissions and thus limiting global warming. The current geopolitical challenges to securing Europe's energy supply are not making this demanding task any easier. The transition to a low -carbon economy thus requires more joint efforts by all energy producers and consumers. This transition period poses a challenge to energy suppliers' competitiveness. But it also offers an opportunity to expand their business. Many countries, communities, and companies are already focusing on climate -friendly energy generation and energy -efficiency measures to achieve their carbon -reduction targets. E.ON's strategic focus on customer solutions for the efficient use of energy and smart energy networks fully aligns its business model with these global trends.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nDistribution networks like E.ON's are the backbone of the energy transition: they integrate renewables, connect producers and consumers, and manage complex energy flows in line with needs . Our solutions help customers of all kinds use energy more efficiently, produce their own renewable or low -carbon energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. In short, climate protection is an integral part of E.ON's business model and corporate governance. We want our business activities to help combat climate change, improve people's lives, and create a future worth living. For example, we support companies and communities in reducing their carbon emissions and expanding their eMobility charging infrastructure.\n\nE.ON wants to shrink its own environmental footprint as well. Since 2004, the Company has disclos ed the annual carbon emissions from its power and heat generation and from other business activities not directly related to generation. These include upstream and downstream emissions associated with E.ON's business activities. E.ON calculates emissions using the globally recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard ('GHG Protocol') issued by the World Resources Institute ('WRI') and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ('WBCSD'). The E.ON Management Board updated the Company's climate targets in 2020 . To achieve them, we have defined specific actions to reduce our emissions in all three scopes of the GHG Protocol (see 'Goals and Performance Re view' below). We use the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard to compile our Scope 3 emissions. In addition, E.ON's 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting approved a new compensation system for the Management Board. Under the system, one quarter of Management Board members' longterm incentive will reflect the degree to which the Company achieves its sustainability targets. The purpose is to further embed ESG aspects like reducing carbon emissions i nto how E.ON runs its business.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nIn October 2021 E.ON revised its Health, Safety, Environment and Climate Protection Policy Statement. It clarifies that environmental and climate protection just as occupational health and safety are integral to E.ON's business operations. E.ON considers environmental and climate protection important and integral management tasks. The policy statement obligates E.ON to consider environmental and climate protection in all business decisions. E.ON's promise to use the best -possible technologies and procedures in its business processes will reduce its environmental impact and enhance its energy efficiency. In addition, it commits E.ON to comply with all health, safety, and environment ('HSE') laws and regulations and defines the appropri ate management systems for this (ISO 45001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001).\n\nIn addition, in late 2021 E.ON adopted an Environmental Protection Guideline. Information about it can be found in the Environmental Managemen t chapter .\n\nTwo other HSE policies that are more specific in nature -the HSE Function Policy and the HSE People Guideline -took effect back at the beginning of 2018. The Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management approaches and tools, and minimum requirements for the entire organization. It empowers the HSE division to monitor our units' compliance with the obligation to have an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or the Eco -Management Audit Scheme (' EMAS ') . In addition, the Function Policy defines HSE standards for incident management. It thus replaces and updates the standards stipulated in previous company policies. The HSE People Guideline goes into greater detail, underlining the importance of environmental and climate protection and defining specific tasks. Our Code of Conduct contains general HSE rules with which all employees must comply.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Group's Sustainability department took the lead in developing the Group -wide climate -prote ction targets. It also monitors progress toward them (see 'Goals and Performance Review' below). The units are supported in their decarbonization efforts by their HSE team and our wider HSE organization, which helps design energy -efficiency measures and shares ideas and best practices. This setup has enabled E.ON to make progress toward its company -wide reduction targets for direct and indirect emissions since the targets were adopted .\n\nE.ON has systematized the management of climate -related risks as well. In 2020 we further embedded climate -risk reporting into Groupwide risk management. More information can be found in the Risks and Chances Report. In addition, our reporting is guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Disclosures ('TCFD'). This can be seen in the 'Other Information' section .",

On the one hand, E.ON intends, by reducing its own GHG emissions, to become climate -neutral b y 2040; our reduction path for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions therefore foresees reducing these emissions by 75 percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2040. On the other, we aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2050. Both reduction paths are relative to a 2019 baseline. Scope 3 emissions occur primarily during the generation of the power E.ON purchases and resells and during the use of the gas E.ON sells. They account for most of E.ON's Group -wide carbon footprint.\n\nThe adoption of our climate strategy set in motion actions to help us achieve the aforementioned climate targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 and thus to support Europe's energy transition. E.ON systematically monitors its progress toward these targets. It is important to remember that year -onyear comparisons of energy consumption can be affected by temporary fluctuations caused by weather patterns and other factors. A period of several years is necessary to determine whether E.ON's actions are effective and where we stand with regard to our targets. Since 2016 we therefore assess the trend in more detail every three years. The trend indicated that so far the reduction rate is in line with the forecasts. Along with the adoption of the aforementioned carbon management plan in 2022 we refined this process by setting reduction rates for our individual business units as well. The units have to conduct controls on an annual basis so that we can see more exactly whether we are making progress along the prescribed path. In addition, each unit has the authority to pursue its own reduction targets that go beyond the target for E.ON as a whole.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n## Carbon Reporting According to the GHG Protocol\n\nE.ON calculates its emissions using the globally recognized WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol for the seven GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocolcarbon dioxide ('CO 2 '), methane ('CH 4 '), nitrous oxide ('N 2 O'), hydrofluorocarbons ('HFCs'), perfluorocarbons ('PFCs'), sulfur hexafluoride ('SF 6 ') and also nitrogen trifluo ride ('NF 3 '). CO 2 is by far our biggest GHG. Other GHGs like SF 6 and CH 4 contribute to E.ON's climate impact. But they account for a much smaller share of our GHG emissions than CO 2 . The Global Warming Potential ('GWP') indicates how much GHGs affect globa l warming over a period of time compared with CO 2 . All GHG emissions can be expressed as CO 2 equivalents ('CO 2 e') and therefore be accounted together.\n\nThe GHG Protocol defines three scopes (Scopes 1 to 3) for GHG accounting and reporting. This improves transparency and provides guidance for different types of climate policies and business objectives.",

They also include fugitive methane emissions from our gas distribution networks.\n\nScope 2 are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of electricity that the Company purchases to power its buildings, operations, and electric vehicles or that are classified as line losses in its power distribution networks. These emissions do not physically occur at E.ON's facilities but rather at the facility where the electricity is generated. This is why power distribution losses are classified as Scope 2 emissions but gas distribution losses as Scope 1 emissions. Emissions attributable to line losses are lower in grid segments with lots of renewables feed -in. In line with the GHG Protocol, we calculate Scope 2 emissions using a location -based method and a market -based method. Fo r its own management decision -making, E.ON uses the figure determined by the locationbased method, which is based on the respective\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnational generation mix . The market -based method yields a different figure because it is based on the contractually attribu table generation mix of the C ompany's electricity suppliers . However, the effort required to identify every single provider that feeds electricity into each of E.ON's networks would be considerable. We therefore use the emission factor of each country's re sidual generation mix. In most cases, this factor is significantly higher than the factor of the national generation mix. Line losses accounted for approximately 3 percent of the power E.ON distributed in 2022.\n\nScope 3 are indirect emissions that occur upstream and downstream along E.ON's value chain. They result primarily from the generation of the electricity the Company purchases and resells to its customers and the use of the gas sold to them.\n\nScope 3 also includes the emissions attributable to the production and provision of the goods and services E.ON purchases. In line\n\nwith the GHG Protocol, since 2020 we have divided our emissions from power and heat generation into emissions from 'plants owned and operated' (Scope 1) and 'plants owned but leased to and operated by lessee' (Scope 3). The purpose is to enhance transparency.\n\nSince E.ON removed large -scale fossil -fueled power generation from its generation portfolio, it has procured power mainly from wholesale markets where the source of generation is often not traceable or information about the source is not reliable. When primary data are unavailable or of insufficient quality, the GHG Protocol recommends calculating emissions by using secondary data, such as industry -average data or government statistics. We therefore calculate the Scope 3 emissions from the generation of this power by using the official national emission factors of the countries in which we purchase power resold to end -customers. Furthermore, w e also use the market -based meth od to calculate the emissions of power resold to end -customers. The Company can actively influence this figure by selling green power. This figure is therefore relevant for management control purpose.\n\nOur direct and indirect CO2 e emissions totaled 88.84 mi llion metric tons in 2022; of these, 3 percent were direct Scope 1 emissions, and 97 percent were indirect Scope 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions decreased by 22 percent compared with the previous year, indirect emissions by around 20 percent. The emissions figures relevant for management control purposes were used for these calculations: location -based Scope 2 emissions and market -based Scope 3 emissions.",

They were thus significantly lower than the prior -year figure of 3.71 million metric tons of CO 2 e. The decrease is mainly due to more accurate technical accounting for the calculation of CH 4 emissions in conjunction with our gas distribution networks. In addition, there was a reduction in owned generation of power and heat.\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in  million metric tons 1   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Power and heat  generation 2, 3                   | 1.90 4 | 2.17 5 | 2.19 6 |\n| Fugitive emissions                                | 0.89 8 | 1.44 7 | 1.65   |\n| Company - owned vehicles                          | 0.05   | 0.04   | 0.04   |\n| Fuels combustion 9                                | 0.05   | 0.05   | 0.04   |\n| Total                                             | 2.88   | 3.71   | 3.92   |\n\n1 The external GWP sources used are the BEIS, formerly DEFRA, the Naturv\u00e5rdsverkets, the GHG Protocol, the \u00d6verenskommelse V\u00e4rmemarknadskommitt\u00e9n 2021, and the IPCC AR5 report. 2 In accordance with the GHG Protocol, from 2019 onward, emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from plants leased to, and operated by, customers (Scope 3). This improves our ability to manage our emissions and make progress toward our targets more transparent. 3 The GHG Protocol and DEFRA attribute no direct CO\u2082 emissions to energy generated at\n\nEmissions from power and heat generation were primarily due to our combined heat and power ('CHP') plants. In 2020 we made our disclosure of Scope 1 emissions from power and heat generation at leased plants more transparent. We now report emissions from downstream plants leased by us as Scope 3 emissions. These are plants that we installed at customers' premises and that they operate as lessees for their own needs. This distinction shows that emissions from our own plants are higher than emissions from leased plants. For heat, 62 percent of emissions come from owned generation plants and 38 percent from leased plants. For power, 40 percent of emissions come from owned power plants and 60 percent from leased plants.\n\nFugitive emissions at E.ON consist predominantly of methane from leaks in gas infrastructu re as well as leaks of sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and coolants used in energy distribution equipment. Their GWP is very high, which is reflected in their high figures .\n\n\u203a However, E.ON's fugitive emissions are quite small in proportion to the quantity distributed and used by customers: in 2022 just 0.3 percent of methane and 0.18 percent of SF 6 were lost. \u2039\n\nGoing forward, we want to reduce fugitive emissions by monitoring leaks and continually improving and modernizing our gas and power networks.\n\n## Scope 2 GRI 305-2\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric  tons 1   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Power distribution losses (location - based) 2    |   3.14 |   3.67 |   4.19 |\n| Power distribution losses (market - based) 3, 4   |   5.52 |   5.56 |   5.83 |\n| Purchased power (location - based)                |   0.25 |   0.23 |   0.3  |\n| Purchased power (market - based)                  |   0.31 |   0.17 |   0.25 |\n| Total (location-based)                            |   3.38 |   3.9  |   4.49 |\n| Total (market-based)                              |   5.83 |   5.73 |   6.09 |\n\nWe recorded location -based Scope 2 emissions of 3.38 million metric tons of CO 2 e in 2022.

E.ON's approach depends on the type of loss. Technical losses can be reduced through network optimization. For this purpose, we are upgrading our networks using smart -grid technology (more information can be found in the Security of Supply chapter). This enables the lines and transformers to adapt -in many cases automatically -to the actual production and consumption in a given grid segment. However, technical losses can only be reduced to a certain extent owing to the physical attributes of power grids. Commercial losses result primarily from theft.\n\n## Scope 3 GRI 305-3\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tons 1               | 2022       | 2021        | 2020        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Purchased power sold to end - customers (location - based) 2 | 40.48 3, 4 | 51.55 3, 4  | 61.27       |\n| Purchased power sold to end - customers (market - based) 2   | 42.51 3, 4 | 54.75 3, 4  | -           |\n| Combustion of natural gas sold to end - customers 2          | 35.63 3    | 44.15 3     | 41.78       |\n| Purchased goods and services 5                               | 2.80 6     | 3.32        | 3.33 7      |\n| Power and heat generation (leased assets) 8                  | 1.56 9     | 1.29 10     | 1.50 11     |\n| Employee commuting 12                                        | 0.05       | 0.05        | 0.05        |\n| Upstream processes of leased assets (leased vehicles)        | 0.02       | 0.02 13     | 0.03 13     |\n| Business travel                                              | 0.00 14    | 0.00 15, 16 | 0.00 16, 17 |\n| Total (location-based)                                       | 80.55      | 100.38      | 107.96      |\n| Total (market-based) 18                                      | 82.58      | 103.58      | -           |",

We recorded a significant reduction of almost 20 percent year on year, mainly because of the electricity and gas we sell to end -customers. The factors again were portfolio streamlining among our B2B customers, mild weather in nearly all of E.ON's regional markets, and crisis -driven energy conservation. The market -based figure for power resold to endcustomers declined even more -by more than 12 million tons of CO2erelative to the prior year. One of the reasons is that we sold more green power (the Sustainable Products and Services chapter contains more information about our green power products).\n\n## Environmental Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3, GRI 302\n\nE.ON assumes responsibility for preserving the natural environment and strives to minimize its business activities' environmental impact. The focus of environmental management, however, has shifted significantly over the past seven years. The transformation into the new E.ON -a specialist for infrastructure and customer solutions to decarbonize the energy world -substantially changed E.ON's asset portfolio and environmental footprint. E.ON operates distribution networks in seven European countries. E nvironmental management therefore places a particular emphasis on protecting and promoting natural habitats and the diversity of ecosystems and species in the vicinity of this network equipment. In addition, we aim to conserve energy and other resources at our facilities and offices and to comply with all international and na tional environmental laws and regulations at all times.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nWe use our energy management system to continually look for opportunities to optimize the Group's energy consumption and the energy efficiency of our processes. It enables us to reduce\n\ngreenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and thus also plays an important role in environmental management, which is a key component of E.ON's operational health, safety, and environmental ('HSE') management. Combining these topics underscores that E.ON is equally committed to protecting people and the environment. In addition, bringing together environmental and energy management as well as occupational health and safety in a joint HSE organization enables us to leverage synergies because the approaches and systems for achieving their objectives are fundamentally similar.\n\nE.ON's environmental management is guided by the precautionary principle endorsed by the United Nations, and E.ON has explicitly supported the UN Global Compact's ten principles since 2005. In addition, E.ON is working to define its own environmental standards, such as ecological corridor management (see 'Specific Actions' below for more information), in order to set a strategic course for the entire Group and to guide the units' environmenta l protection activities. We developed an Environmental Protection Guideline in late 2021 that describes E.ON's holistic approach to environmental protection. It was published in the first quarter of 2022 and contains the following five commitments: we care for ecosystems, we steer our organization towards ecosystem protection, we maximize our impact, we set clear targets, we engage for environmental protection.\n\nE.ON only wants to do business with companies that share its commitment to environmental protect ion . Consequently, our suppliers and contractors must commit to complying with our environmental standards, and our HSE Policy stipulates that they must have a certified environmental management system in place (the next section, 'Guidelines and Policies,' contains more information).\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nDepending on existing risks as well as their scale and complexity, E.ON's HSE Policy requires contractors to provide evidence of the use of HSE management systems that meet international\n\nstandards . All E .ON units -except for very small units and those with nonmaterial environmental risks -must have an environmental management system that is certified to ISO 14001 or validated by means of the Eco -Management and Audit Scheme ('EMAS').\n\n\u203a At yearend 2022, 75 percent of E.ON employees worked in business units that met this requirement. \u2039\n\nIn accordance with the German Energy Services Act (German abbreviation, 'EDL -G'), E.ON has also i ntroduced ISO 50001 certification in units that already have an HSE management system.\n\n\u203a At yearend 2022, 67 percent of E.ON employees worked in business units with ISO 50001 certification. \u2039\n\nE .ON measures and analyzes the energy consumption of facilities, vehicle fleets, and office buildings at all of these units. The data help us identify savings opportunities and take cost -effective measures to improve energy efficiency. All u nits without ISO 50001 certification conduct energy audits in accordance with DIN EN 16247 under the EDL -G in Germany and analogous legislation in other European countries (more information on measures and guidelines can be found in the chapters entitled Climate Protection and Occupational Health and Safety).\n\nIn 2021 E.ON began compiling a manual on ecological corridor management. It consists of minimum standards for ecological vegetation management solutions under 110 kV high -voltage overhead power lines. We intend to extend this approach to all Groupowned distribution system operators in Europe by 2029 ('Specific Actions' below contains more information).\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Group's Sustainability department played a leading role in developing company -wide climate protection targets and has since then been monitoring progress toward them. E.ON's units are",

They are supported in these efforts by their Sustainability and HSE teams and our wider HSE organization, which help design energy -efficiency measures and share ideas and best practices. The Climate Protection chapter contains information on E.ON's new carbon management p lan, which took effect in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nprocurement of company cars and leased vehicles unambiguously supports the use of all -electric and hybrid vehicles. More information on our eMobility efforts can be found in the Sustainable Products and Services chapter .\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON employees and managers are required to report environmental incidents. They use an IT application called PRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits) for this purpose (the Occupational Health and Safety c hapter contains more information on PRISMA and E.ON's incident management).\n\nE.ON has taken several steps to improve the energy efficiency of its facilities in Germany. These include installing sensor -controlled LED lighting in buildings and parking garages and reducing the energy consumption of ventilation and air -conditioning systems. We also adjust the heat in our buildings to demand (the Energy Affordability chapter contains more information about energy conservation). Many E.ON facilities in Germany organize these measures by means of an energy management system ('EnMS') certified to ISO 50001. ISO 50001 is an international standard designed to enable organizations to continually improve their energy efficiency. As part of the EnMS, the energy team sets annual targets and conducts systematic audits to monitor the effectiveness of the measures taken to achieve them. It also conducts an annual management review, which is audited by an accredited certification organization. These mechanisms confirmed t he EnMS's effectiveness.\n\nIn 2017 E.ON began offering its employees in Germany incentives to embrace eMobility. They include attractively priced leasing contracts for electric vehicles ('EVs'), at -home charging points, and certified renewable power tariffs, which enable employees to charge their EVs with clean energy. E.ON's Car Policy for the\n\nFor projects to build new power lines, gas pipelines, and other large industrial facilities with a foreseeable environmental impact, E.ON conducts an environmental impact assessment during the development phase to obtain construction and operating permits. We also frequently monitor a facility's operation to verify that the initial assessment was correct. In addition, E.ON maintains an ongoing dialog with local stakeholders and interested parties on numerous environmental issues.\n\nIn 2022 E.ON analyzed the extent to which its business model impact biodiversity. The analysis encompasses E.ON's own operations and its suppliers'. Our aim was to understand the positive and negative impact of our business on biodiversity and to use the findings to design targeted measures. The analysis took into account the draft frameworks currently being developed by the Science Based Targets Network ('SBTN') and the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures ('TNFD'). On the one hand, we reviewed how the energy sector affects ecosystem services and how dependent various production processes are on such services. This included assessing the risk for E.ON if an ecosystem service was lost somewhere along the value chain. In detail, the impact analysis on ecosystem services assesses the production processes of E.ON's operations, regardless of their share of E.ON's total business. The results are as follows: the production processes with the highest impact are energy from biomass, hydropower, thermal power plants (percentage of taxonomy -eligible capex), and nuclear power plants ('NPPs'; percentage of total asset book value). E.ON is currently in the process of dismantling its NPPs . Only Isar 2 NPP will remain in operation until mid -April 2023 as a result of a decision by the German government.\n\n## Impact Analysis on Ecosystem Services\n\n| Impact on Natural Capital   | Impact on Natural Capital      | Impact on Natural Capital   |                           |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Production  processes       | Use of terrestrial  ecosystems | Water use                   | Greenhouse gas  emissions |\n| Hydro power                 | Very high                      | Very high                   | High                      |\n| Biomass energy              | - 1                            | High                        | High                      |\n| Heat and power  plants      | - 1                            | Very high                   | High                      |\n\n1 No information due to insufficient data on the ENCORE database.\n\nOn the other hand, we located selected E.ON facilities to better understand the importance of spatially specific geodata for the assessment of biodiversity risks. The analysis of geographic data from a total of 133 selected facilities (our own and key suppliers) revealed that 20 percent of them are located in the immediate vicinity of one to two key biodiversity areas. In addition, various E.ON facilities are located in German nature conservation areas. The study also ranks the ten facilities with the greatest biodiversity impact. E.ON wants to use the findings to develop additional measures to further promote biodiversity in its business.\n\nE.ON also takes steps to protect wildlife and landscapes and to promote biodiversity. Bird safety, for example, is an im portant issue for many of E.ON distribution system operators ('DSOs'). Their activities in this area include installing nest platforms for storks, eagles, falcons, and other bird species. Many business units have also launched tree -planting projects. In addition, E.ON has set up a Groupwide digital platform for biodiversity and environmental -protection projects to improve the visibility of the issue and the exchange of information about it.\n\nE.ON has developed a concept for ecological corridor management t o ecologically manage the vegetation under and near 110 kV high -voltage overhead powerlines in forests.

We plan to design specific vegetation management plans for every hectare of forest by 2029 and to invest a figure in the double -digit million range to implement them. Our aim is to ensure intact ecosystems and greater biodiversity along the 13,000 kilometers of our high -voltage lines, which is roughly the area of around 100,000 soccer fields.\n\nIn late 2020 E.ON founded the E.ON Environmental Network ('EEN') in Germany. The EEN is a forum for sharing information on operational environmental issues, environmental management, sustainability as well as related legislation, standards, and benchmarks. It brings together experts from our network and customer solutions business, works closely with the HSE and Sustainability teams, and meets on a quarterly basis, in most cases virtually. Since its inception, the EEN's reach across the Group has expanded continually. In addition to the issues addressed in 2021 -commercial waste, ISO 14001 environmental assessment, and networking of biodiversity and environmental -protection projects -one of the steps the EEN took in 2022 was to create a working group for the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance and the new Substitute Building Materials Ordinance. It addresses the requirements that our business units must meet as a result of the ordinance's amendment. E.ON also has a European EEN, which brings together E.ON colleagues outside Germany. Both forums met several times in 2022. We intend to expand these networks in the years ahead and transform them into Gr oupwide information -sharing platforms.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about serious environmental incidents (category 3 in our Standard on Incident Management) by means of monthly reports from HSE and periodic consultations with the Senior Vice President for HSE. In the case of\n\na major incident (category 4), the unit at which it occurred reports it directly to the E.ON Management Board member responsible for the respective unit and to Group HSE within 24 hours.\n\nE.ON has been a member of EV100 since 2018. EV100 is a global initiative that has been led by the Climate Group, a non -profit organization. It brings together companies committed to accelerating the transition to EVs and to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. In 2022 the initiative made more progress toward this goal. The number of members increased to more than 120.\n\n\u203a Collectively, they have committed to operating more than 5.5 million EVs by 2030 and have so far put more than 200,000 EVs on the streets. They are also expanding the charging infrastructure at their facilities. Over 20,000 charging points had been install ed by year-end 2022. \u2039\n\nE.ON has supported EV100 by installing more than 3,400 charging points for employees, guests, and customers at its facilities, including around 1,200 in Germany alone. In addition, all E.ON vehicles under 3.5 metric tons and at least half of those between 3.5 and 7.5 metric tons are to be electric by 2030, provided this is technically feasible and cost -efficient. In 2022 we therefore revis ed the E.ON Car Policy to make our vehicle fleets even more climate and environmentally friendly. We also increased the number of our electric vehicles by 963 to a total of more than 3,841 at year-end. 2 In addition, E.ON will continue to install charging infrastructure at its facilities. The aim is a lso to encourage our customers to switch to eMobility.\n\n2 Includes hybrid vehicles.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\nEnergy Consumption within the Organization GRI 302-1\n\nE.ON consumed 109 million GJ of energy in 2022, 145 million GJ less than in 2021. The main reason was that the nuclear power plants operated by PreussenElektra ('PEL') produced less electricity.\n\n## Savings Delivered by Emission -reduction Projects\n\nE.ON regularly carries out projects to reduce its own GHG emissions. In 2022 these projects delivered over  61,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e savings. The measures to achieve them included upgrading the boilers in the plants of our district heating business, converting from natural to green gas, and reducing pipeline pressure in our gas networks prior to construction or maintenance in order to prevent fugitive methane emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If neither avoidance nor recovery is possible, we ensure, in accordance with legal requirements, that waste is disposed of correctly and responsibly. E.ON's operating business generates hazardous and non -hazardous waste, as does the retirement of some assets, such as the dismantling of the Company's NPPs in Germany.\n\n## Non-hazardous Waste (Metric Kilotons)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON's total amount of non -hazardous waste decreased from 428 .0 metric kilotons in 2021 to 381.3 metric kilotons in 2022. There was an increase in the previous year, which was largely due to our Westnetz GmbH subsidiary and activities in Sweden. In contrast, the amount in 2022 declined because of a few individual changes at several companies. E.ON recycled 67 percent of its nonhazardous waste.\n\n## Hazardous Waste (Metric Kilotons)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON produced 162.2 metric kilotons of hazardous waste in 2022, about 21 metric kilotons more than in 2021, of which 66 percent was recycled.\n\n## Other Atmospheric Emissions 1\n\n| Metric tons    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| NOx emissions  | 2,690  | 1,716  | 1,420  |\n| SO\u2082 emissions  | 652    | 581    | 732    |\n| Dust emissions | 51     | 61     | 133    |\n\nFossil -fueled power plants emit nitric oxide ('NOx'), sulfur dioxide (' SO2 '), and dust. This type of power generation is no longer a core E.ON business. It is therefore no longer considered a core KPI. E.ON now focuses on small -scale, embedded generation units. NOx, SO 2 , a nd dust emissions result mainly from small gas -fired CHP plants and larger plants for district heating networks. The high figures for NOx emissions in 2022 are attributable to the first reported figures from a company that operates renewable generation plants .\n\n## Responsible Water Management\n\nWater is a vital resource that is becoming increasingly scarce in some parts of the world. Many companies are therefore placing greater emphasis on identifying and managing water risks at their operations and along their supply chains. The same is true for\n\ninvestors and their portfolios. E.ON's water -related activities relate to the following areas: the withdrawal of cooling water for the NPP operated by PEL (for more information, see ' Non-Core Business: Water Management at PreussenElektra' below) and the withdrawal of fresh water by E.ON's water utility subsidiaries RWW and Avacon Wasser as well as a small amou nt in conjunction with our decentralized energy business. In addition , LEW operates a number of small and medium -sized run -of -river power plants in Germany with an installed capacity of 0.5 to 12 MW per plant. These plants accounted for about 0 . 02 percent of E.ON's total power generation in 2022 .\n\n## E.ON's Water Consumption from Decentralized Energy Generation\n\n| Million cubic meters    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fresh water consumption | < 1    | < 1    | < 1    |\n\nWater utilities RWW and Avacon Wasser have belonged to E.ON's portfolio since 2019. They supply about 1.4 million people, industrial enterprises, and businesses in Lower Saxony, North Rhine -Westphalia, and Saxony -Anhalt with roughly 78 million cubic meters of water annually.\n\nAccordingly, this business involves the extraction of water as a resource and its treatment as well as final distribution to end -users; it also includes the reuse of wastewater and thus the closing of the water cycle. Although water operations account for only a small proportion of the Group's total sales, we pay particular attention to the associated consequences from the perspective of resource conservation and supply security. We use two KPIs to assess the water utility business's risks: total withdrawal and distribution losses. Withdrawal is the amount of water supplied to endusers; that is, not water used in our own operations. The basis for a permanent supply of water is a climate with sufficient precipitation to allow surface and groundwater to reform. This can generally be anticipated in RWW's and Avacon Wasser's service",

The regions' available surface water and groundwater reserves will secure drinking and process water requirements.\n\nBased on available data, E.ON assesses the current and the possibility of future water scarcity in the relevant regions in which E.ON uses fresh water for its activities to be generally low. Additional disclosures on E.ON's water withdrawal and risks areas can be found in the Sustainability KPIs. The operation of our facilities does not consume large quantities of water. A temporary exception is our PEL unit, which operated one NPP in Germany in 2022; because of political decisions made in the year under review, Isar 2 NPP will continue to operate until April 15, 2023, after which it will cease producing electricity.\n\nFor E.ON's water utilities, water and climate protection go hand in hand: we conduct a variety of projects to address both issues and are always looking for new, more environmentally compatible solutions for wastewater disposal, sewage sludge recycling, as well as service water and rainwater utilization. For example, we are designing plans for smart water use in new residential areas and working on flood -protection systems in municipalities. Conducting research and development projects enables us to investigate innovative solutions for qualitative and quantitative water protection, such as additional potential resources for irrigation.\n\nIn addition, RWW and Avacon Wasser provide information on the careful use of water as a resource. Important channels are the company websites and press releases. For example, during the summer months RWW gives its customers advice on the careful, appropriate use of fresh water. In addition, RWW has operated educational facilities -Aquarius and Haus Ruhrnatur -since 1992, in which visitors can learn about topics related to water supply and preventive water protection. Museum educators at the two educational facilities offer various lessons on water and environmental protection to schools in RWW's service territory.\n\n| E.ON's Water Consumption from Water Supply Operations   | E.ON's Water Consumption from Water Supply Operations   | E.ON's Water Consumption from Water Supply Operations   | E.ON's Water Consumption from Water Supply Operations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Infrastructure Leakage  Index (\"ILI\")                   | 2022                                                    | 2021                                                    | 2020                                                    |\n| Factor                                                  | \u2264 1.5 1                                                 | \u2264 1.5                                                   | \u2264 1.5                                                   |\n\n1 Figures for 2022 are based on a preliminary estimate based on prior -year figures.\n\nI nfrastructure leakage index ('ILI') enables water utilities to measure and compare water losses. ILI is a KPI for assessing water losses that is widely used and recognized internationally. ILI factors in not only the amount of water loss, but also the relevant parameters (such as pipeline system length and pressure). Unlike the KPI commonly used in Germany (specific actual water loss, or QVR ), ILI offers better comparability with structurally similar companies and better guidance for a company's own water management . By international standards, E.ON's ILI of less than 1.5 puts it in the best leakage performance category of A (ILI \u22642) .\n\n## NonCore Business: Water Management at PreussenElektra\n\nThe NPP in Germany operated by our subsidiary PEL accounts for a significant share of E.ON's water consumption and use. Its NPPs use water for cooling and processes. PEL is committed to using water efficiently and sustainably and to maintaining high quality in the river from which its plants withdraw water. It also strives continually to use less. PEL observes all laws and regulations regarding water withdrawal and discharge. The most important law for PEL in this context is the Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, or 'WHG'). PEL protects aquatic flora and fauna by using mechanical purification processes instead of biocides and by constantly monitoring the temperature of discharge water. PEL also expects its contractors to use water sparingly and has binding water -management provisions in its agreements with them. Below is a three -year overview of how much water PEL has withdrawn, discharged, and consumed.\n\n## PELs Water Balance\n\n| Million cubic meters    |   2022 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fresh water withdrawal  |    245 | 2,383  | 2,186  |\n| Fresh water discharge   |    216 | 2,331  | 2,140  |\n| Fresh water consumption |     29 | 53     | 46     |\n\nIn 2022 PEL withdrew 245.3 million cubic meters of freshwater, 2,138 million cubic meters less than in 2021. PEL uses freshwater, which comes almost exclusively from rivers, primarily as cooling water. Water consumption dropped sharply compared with the previous year because the discharge of water not used for cooling decreased equally to the withdrawal of water not used for cooling. This is related to the shutdown of the Grohnde NPP as well as a reduction in the amount of withdrawal due to the progress of dismantling at Unterweser and Brokdorf NPPs. PEL returned 88.2 percent of withdrawn water to its source.\n\n## NonCore Business: Safe Handling of Radioactive Waste\n\nPEL is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of its NPPs. Both activities result in radioactive waste. E.ON is well aware of the high responsibility that is associated with both.\n\nThe Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal (Entsorgungs\u00fcbergangsgesetz, or 'Ents\u00dcG') and the contract to finance the costs of the nuclear -energy phaseout between the German federal government and German NPP operators stipulate the division of responsibility for nuclear waste interim storage and final disposal and its financing.\n\nE.ON aims to minimize the amount as well as the volume of radioactive waste. We do this in part by separating it from uncontaminated waste and by subjecting it to certain treatments that reduce its volume. The nuclear industry distinguishes between radioactive waste that generates negligible heat -",

Examples of LLW include protective clothing, cleaning equipment, tools, and building rubble from plant control areas. ILW includes, in particular, the reactor pressure vessel's near -core mounting parts. Together, both waste categories contain less than 1 percent of an NPP's total radioactivity .\n- \u00b7 HLW contains more than 99 percent of an NPP's total radioactivity and consists primarily of the fission products of uranium in the irradiated fuel assemblies.\n\nNPP operators are responsible for packaging LLW and ILW safely and according to approved standards. After regulatory certification, packaged LLW and ILW becomes the responsibility of the German federal government. The Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal transferred the responsibility for operating defined storage facilities for LLW and ILW. Pursuant to this law, the federal government is responsible for the storage of PEL's LLW and ILW effective January 1, 202 0. This applies to the following PEL facilities: Stade NPP, W\u00fcrgassen transport staging hall, Grafenrheinfeld staging hall, Unterweser radioactive waste storage facility, and Unterweser storage facility. The Konrad repository for LLW and ILW is currently b eing built by BGE, the German Federal Company for Radioactive Waste Disposal. BGE expects Konrad to be commissioned in 2027.\n\nAs with LLW and ILW, irradiated fuel assemblies are placed in approved transport and storage containers and stored in interim storage facilities at the NPPs. Under the Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal, the interim storage facilities and containers of irradiated fuel assemblies became the property and responsibility of the federal government effective January 1, 2019. Fuel assemblies will remain in the interim storage facilities until Germany has a state -\n\nowned receiving facility or repository for HLW. When this will happen is unclear. The responsibility for final disposal lies with the federal government.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor 2022 PEL submitted notification for 314.5 metric tons less LLW and ILW than for 2021. The amount of waste is subject to fluctuations, depending on the NPPs' dismantling activities. HLW decreased to 0 metric tons due to the decommissioning of NPPs. New fuel rods were installed in Isar 2 NPP -which will continue to operate temporarily until April 15, 2023 -for the last time in October 2021.",

This encompasses ensuring our employees' safety in the workplace, promoting their health, and also supporting their mental well -being. Some employees perform high -risk work, such as on energy networks, gas pipelines, and other industrial facilities. St ringent safety standards are therefore of particular importance to E.ON. This is because accidents not only endanger employees' health, but may also result in damage to assets, work interruptions, and a loss of reputation. E.ON adopts a zero -harm principle and therefore strives to cause and allow as little harm as possible. The Covid -19 pandemic has made safety, health, and well -being even more important in recent years than before. E.ON meets the pandemic's challenges by means of its caring culture.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nHealth and safety ('H&S') have long been firmly embedded in E.ON's corporate culture and its organizational setup, policies, and procedures. E.ON's approach is proactive and preventive.\n\nWe are unambiguously committed to the principle of zero tolerance of accidents. E.ON's main objective is to prevent occupational accidents from the outset. This applies to E.ON employees as well as contractor employees who work on its behalf.\n\nE.ON's ambition is to actively promote employees' well -being and enable them to maintain their performance and employability in the future as well. In particular, we try to prevent the main health conditions that most frequently result in unfitness for work. E.ON's health management includes designing and providing health services (such as flu vaccinations) as well as target -groupspecific individual measures to maintain health. It typically encompasses issues that are relevant for all employees or for\n\ncertain target groups. Issues include general health maintenance, nutrition , exercise, mental health, stress management, addiction prevention, and healthy leadership. E.ON promotes them by means of training sessions, information leaflets, presentations, and digital formats. Its use of the latter was again high in 2022 due to the Covid -19 pandemic.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON is committed to a culture of prevention. We reaffirmed this in 2009 by signing the D\u00fcsseldorf Statement on the Seoul Declaration on Safety and Health at Work as well as the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion.\n\nE.ON has had a Group Company Agreement on Health for all employees in Germany since 2015; it was last revised in 2018. Its purpose is to foster a healthy work environment and promote the health of all employees. It defines four action areas: occupational health management, addiction prevention and intervention, occupational integration management, and employee counseling.\n\nThe E.ON Health, Safety, Environment & Climate Protection Policy Statement, which was originally published in 2018, was updated in 2021 to reflect E.ON's Vision Zero for safety targets as well as its climate and environmental targets in the context of the EU taxonomy. In addition, we simplified the document's language and eliminated redundancies.\n\nA Groupwide standard for assessing risks to health, safety, and the environment ('HSE') has applied in the Company since the start of 2021. It defines the minimum requirements for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, managing, and monitoring HSE and other sustainability -related dangers and opportunities. The standards' requirements are also supported by IT solutions, which are mainly used to create risk assessments and/or indices as well as activity -related danger evaluations. Our employees have the opportunity to view danger evaluations relevant to them and the resulting protection measures.\n\nThe Group HSE Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management expectations, and reporting channels. It sets minimum requirements and defines management tools needed to prevent physical and mental harm in the workplace. It also requires all our operating units (except for very small ones and those with insignificant risks and potential impact) to have in place an occupational H&S management system certified to international standards -such as ISO 45001 (which replaced OHSAS 18001) -and to improve the system on an ongoing basis.\n\n\u203a At year -end 2022, 85 percent of our employees worked at business units certified to ISO 45001. \u2039\n\nE.ON refined the Group HSE Function Policy in 2022. For example, we added or sharpened the definition of tasks and task areas and formulations, in part to better integrate sustainability aspects Groupwide, including task areas such as the environment and biodiversity, sustainability reporting, and supply chain.\n\nIn addition, the People Guideline on HSE communicates E.ON's HSE aspirations and states the expectation that all employees embrace HSE on the job. It also describes E.ON's Safety F1RST principles for the safety mindset and behaviors necessary to prevent accidents. The guideline contains extra tasks for managers, because their responsibilities include leading by example with regard to HSE.\n\nIn addition, E.ON updated the Group standard for incident management during the year under review in order to sharpen definitions and processes; the standard applies to E.ON contract ors as well. It establish rd consistent rules for classifying, investigating, analyzing, and reporting HSE incidents and for sharing information. It complements PRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits), E.ON's IT solution for incident management, which is described below under 'Specific Actions.'",

It defines expectations for 15 core elements. It addresses occupational safety and acci dent prevention as well as the safety of E.ON's facilities and products over their entire life cycle. The chapter entitled Data Protection, Cybersecurity, and Product Safety contains more information about product safety. This standard provides the foundation for all cascading HSE rules and processes at E.ON, thereby supplementing the requirements of the relevant ISO standards. E.ON developed an assessment tool to simplify implementation and assess the status of management systems.\n\nIn addition, the HSE department worked more closely with the Supply Chain team to define procurement policies and standards that require E.ON's suppliers to commit to meet minimum standards for HSE. They also firmly embedded HSE issues in all procurement processes. Harmonized minimum HSE requirements for contractors now apply at all E.ON companies in Germany. In addition, E.ON implemented a Group -wide standard for contractor management at year -end 2022. It defines minimum requirements and roles and responsibilities to ensure the consistent evaluation and management of HSE issues and risks in the collaboration with contractors. E.ON companies must integrate the requirements into their processes within 18 months (by May 2024). They are supported by a catalogue of contractor management measures, which also serves as an assessment tool for the implementation of the standard.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON is committed to protecting people and the environment. Because the approaches and systems for both are similar, E.ON combines environmental management and occupational H&S management in a single HSE organization. The E.ON Management Board and the management of our units are responsible for E.ON's HSE performance, which includes compliance as well as improvement. They set targets and update policies to foster continuous improvement. They are supported and advised by the HSE department at Corporate Functions and the E.ON HSE\n\nCouncil. The council is composed of senior executives and employee representatives from different business areas and countries in which E.ON is active. It meets at least three times a year and is chaired by the member of the E.ON Management Board responsible for HSE. E.ON units have their own HSE councils and expert teams as well. They define the HSE requirements for their unit and plans to implement them. Every unit must ensure that it meets E.ON's corporate and HSE standards, design and implement HSE plans according local needs, and follow E.ON's HSE Strategy Roadmap fo r 2021-23.\n\nE.ON reactivated the International Health Experts team to foster health -related improvements and innovations and thus its health strategy. Since 2022 the team has again been sharing knowledge and experience between countries to identify opportunities for collaboration.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nThe HSE department oversees strategic H&S training sessions. This includes the training provided to the E.ON Group's top 100 executives, programs for senior managers in the operating business, and training for staff who conduct incident investigations (such as root -cause analysis). With regard to the Group HSE Strategy Roadmap, E.ON's units conduct their own operational H&S training, programs to enhance HSE culture, and training required by law.\n\nA trainthe -trainer module further advanced and supplemented the program to establish E.ON's caring culture. The aim is to reach lower management levels as well and to enable trainers in the units to communicate HSE to their teams.\n\nE.ON managers in Germany can enroll in Healthy Leadership, a training module on how to address health issues and thereby promote health in their team. This training continued to be conducted digitally in 2022 and covered aspects such as stress reduction, mental health, and tips for an ergonomic workplace.\n\nE.ON employees in Germany had free access to online ergonomics advisors, including for their home office.\n\nIn addition, workshops for a common understanding of E.ON's caring culture were held for the top 100 executives and senior managers from operations and administration.\n\nE.ON considers itself a learning company whose ambition is continuous improvement. This includes a constructive culture of failure as well. We thoroughly investigate incidents by conducting rootcause analyses ('RCA'). For this purpose, E.ON has introduced a specific Group standard and, in 2022, further expanded the related training and continuing skills development offerings. The training courses, which were offered in person again for the first time since the pandemic, cover topics such as investigation methods and communication. Lessons learned from incident investigations are shared throughout the Group and are incorporated into the units' activities and into working groups. E.ON also uses the lessons learned to institute preventive measures.\n\nPRISMA, an integrated IT solution, is the main component of E.ON's online incident management system and is used by all E.ON units. It enables us to reach many users, report and manage data, and ensure a high degree of transparency. Incident investigations are entered and stored directly in PRISMA, ensuring that all companies and Corporate Functions always work with the same database. Incident reporting is prompt, and the situation should be clear for everyone involved. All this is intended to help prevent incidents. E.ON has five categories of incidents. They range from 0 (low) to 4 (major). E.ON's HSE Standard on Incident Management requires the units to use PRISMA to report category 4 incidents to the HSE department at Corporate Functions within 24 hours; in addition, the units immediately forward the information to the Management Board. Employees must report all incidents, regardless of their severity, using PRISMA. No employee needs to fear any retribution. In addition, their personal data are always pro tected and can only be accessed by limited user groups. E.ON",

If employees or contractors who find themselves in a situation that they believe is potentially dangerous, they have clear instructions to suspend work immediately and, if necessary, leave the work area. They are also instructed to alert their colleagues to potentially dangerous situations. We conducted a Group -wide training module in 2022 to make it clear to all employees how to use PRISMA.\n\nE.ON's managers fulfil their responsibility as health and safety leaders in part by going on safety walks and engaging in dialog ue with employees. During management visits, known as gemba walks, they can take a close look at workplaces, talk directly with employees, and deepen their understanding of HSE issues, including risks. The Group -wide HSE app (formerly \"Go, See & Talk\") facilitates the process. Among other things, it contains questions for each type of work environment, including safety culture and workplace health issues. E.ON managers also use the app to submit answers they received, their own observations, and photos and documents. The information is automatically entered into PRISMA for additional analysis. Since 2022, near misses and unsafe conditions or behaviors can also be recorded in the app. More functions will follow as part of a program called Digitali zation@HSE that was launched in the year under review. For example, the app's functions for reporting near misses and for conducting audits and inspections will be simplifi ed to better involve all employees. The overarching objective is to improve E.ON's entire HSE performance. The HSE division has conducted quick checks since August 2021. They involve an outside partner evaluating E.ON's safety culture and identifying possible risks. So far, 21 quick checks have been conducted at our operating units.\n\nE.ON runs an HSE Community that extends across all regions and segments. It helps us be a learning company and serves in particular to share knowledge and experience. The commun ity meets regularly and, as needed, in special expert groups. Experts work together to achieve improvements in key areas like incident prevention. The range of topics in 2022 included pylon safety,\n\nelectrical safety, HSE in the installation business, and safety in underground engineering.\n\nThe units and Corporate Functions also work together on Connect, E.ON's Group -wide social media platform. The form and content of HSE topics on the platform are continually expanded and updated. The additions in 2022 included a central marketplace for good HSE practices to promote mutual learning.\n\nManagers and employees who have questions or concerns about their physical or mental health can contact the Employee Assistance Program ('EAP'). The EAP is a free health -advisory and life -coaching service available in multiple languages to E.ON staff in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Hungary. We have similar programs in other countries where we operate. Alongside the EAP, E.ON offers employees and managers one -on-one psycho -social counseling.\n\nThere are also supplementary functions and roles at E.ON, including social, addiction, and health counseling. Across the Company, these functions and roles are performed by employees alongside their regular duties. These employees ar e obliged to maintain confidentiality.\n\nNonemployees working at an E.ON office, such as service providers, can participate in general prevention measures like health days. E.ON employees can also take advantage of specific preventive measures (for example, nutrition counseling, and colon and skin cancer screening), consult company physicians, and take advantage of EAP benefits as well as use company fitness facilities.\n\nE.ON continued to provide information material on Covid -19 in the year under review; it included comprehensive recommendations, guidelines, and frequently asked questions, such as on the safety and health plans of individual facilities and offices. This information was disseminated by email, the intranet, and online Board Chats in which the Management Board outlined E.ON's\n\nposition on the Covid -19 pandemic situation. The aim of the measures was to ensure safety in the workplace and prevent infections.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about category 3 and 4 inc idents, developments relating to accidents, and related measures and programs by means of monthly reports from HSE and regular consultations with the Senior Vice President Group HSE. The units report fatal and life -threatening incidents directly to the Management Board within 24 hours.\n\nThe purpose of E.ON's incident analyses is to understand causes, take measures to prevent them, and identify risks. If accident data indicate that a unit does not meet E.ON standards, the HSE department supports it in optimization. In addition, Group Audit may conduct an HSE audit at the unit.\n\nThe findings of the incident investigations and HSE audits completed in 2022 show that HSE management systems are largely effective. The units have adopted the auditors' resulting recommendations and have generally used them to design corrective and preventive actions. It also became clear, however, that employees' safety awareness was not fully adequate in all teams. It therefore remains extremely important to continu ally point ou t to E.ON employees and contractor employees all the requirements of HSE management and their own responsibility: they must look after themselves and their colleagues and speak up immediately if they detect a potential safety risk. Overall, E.ON has observed for several years that occupational safety in its units is improving continually. We can clearly see that our measures to prevent serious occupational accidents are having an effect. One example is a discernable shift from serious incidents to less serious incidents. Furthermore, E.ON views audits -and the findings and recommendations they yield -as opportunities to foster continuous improvement.",

In 2020 E.ON adopted a new HSE strategy ('Roadmap 2021 -23'), endorsed by the HSE Council, whose aim is to position E.ON as a leading HSE company. The strategy contains underlying targets for the operating units, including H&S, and their respective board members. In addition, the Management Board set personal H&S targets for top executives. The targets for top executives and units are individual. Their purpose is to further reduce the frequency of serious incidents and fatalities ('SIF') and thus to reach E.ON's ultimate object ive of zero major harm as soon as possible. The changes took effect on January 1, 2021. As part of the half -year discussions known as performance dialogues, the units provided feedback on their progress in implementing the strategy and on recommended adjustments. In 2023 E.ON intends to use their feedback to revis e its HSE roadmap and targets. In particular, health management (for which there is a new strategy), environmental issues as well as digitalization and contract management will be pursued more inte nsively.\n\nThe extent to which E.ON's health strategy is successful depends in part on whether employees receive information about health and prevention and whether this motivates them to participate in related programs. To increase willingness to participate, health programs are often tailored to the needs of specific target groups. E.ON's network operators in Germany, for example, target their employees aged 50 and over in particular as well as employees in their field offices. Actions include workshops on healthy living in older age and preparing for retirement. There are also special offers, for example, for operational employees such as fitters and administrative staff. The return on investment ('ROI') of many health programs is calculated by comparing costs with avoided absenteeism based on research and statistics. So that all employees feel comfortable, valued, and supported in their work environment, E.ON places particular emphasis on mental health. We provide information on the importance of stress management and show how to recognize signs of mental health issues . In addition, E.ON has assistance and training on stress reduction,\n\nself -assessment tests, and a direct support offering, including through the EAP.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accident Statistics\n\nSerious incidents and fatalities ('SIF') measures accidents and incidents that have caused serious or fatal injuries and that surpass a predefined severity threshold.\n\n|   Employee SIF 1 | Employee SIF 1   |   Employee SIF 1 |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|          2022    | 2021 2           |          2020    |\n|             0.04 | 0.10             |             0.09 |\n\nAt 0.04, employee SIF was significantly below the prior -year level (2021: 0.10).\n\n\u203a Contractor SIF declined to 0.05 (2021: 0.21). Combined SIF was 0.05 in 2022 (2021: 0.15), a reduction of around 64 percent. \u2039\n\n|   Employee LTIF 1 | Employee LTIF 1   | Employee LTIF 1   |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|            2022   | 2021 2            | 2020 2            |\n|               2.1 | 2.1               | 1.6               |\n\n1 Lost -time injury frequency measures work -related accidents resulting in lost time per million hours of work.\n\nLost -time injury frequency ('LTIF') measures work -related accidents resulting in lost time per million hours of work. Employee LTIF was 2.1 (2021: 2.1).\n\n\u203a Contractor LTIF was 2.0 (2021: 2.0), thus at the prior -year level. Combined LTIF was 2.0 in 2022 (2021: 2.0), also in line with the previous year. \u2039\n\nTotal recordable injury frequency ('TRIF') is one of E.ON's KPI for safety. It measures the number of recorded work -related injuries and illnesses per million hours of work. E.ON has calculated it since 2010 (employee TRIF) and included contractor employees' in its safety performance since 2011 (combined TRIF).\n\n## Employee TRIF and Combined TRIF 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                 |   2022 |   2021 2 |   2020 |\n|-----------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Employee TRIF 1 |    2.9 |      2.6 |    2.4 |\n| Combined TRIF   |    2.6 |      2.5 |    2.3 |\n\n\u203a TRIF of 2.9 in 2022 was higher than in the prior year (2.6).

Employee TRIF and combined TRIF increased in part because of a reduction in the number of working hours due to the disposal of c ompanies in Hungary and the United Kingdom. Other reasons include fewer pandemic -related restrictions and investments at some units, which resulted in an increase in the number of construction sites. \u2039\n\n| Employee NMFR 1   |   Employee NMFR 1 | Employee NMFR 1   |   Employee NMFR 1 |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                   |              2022 | 2021 2            |              2020 |\n| Employee NMFR     |                36 | 34                |                19 |\n\n\u203a Near -miss frequency rate ('NMFR') measures unplanned incidents that had the potential to result in an accident (but did not) per million hours of work. E.ON analyzes how and why near misses happened and then puts in place controls to minimize or eliminate similar risks in the future. We actively encourage employees to report near misses so that we can continually improve our safety performance. E.ON's NMFR was 36 in 2022. \u2039\n\n## Fatal Accidents at Work\n\nRegrettably, three people working for E.ON died in 2022 due to occupational accidents. One contractor employee suffered a fatal electric shock, and another contractor employee was fatally injured by a piece of heavy equipment. After a lengthy hospital stay, an E.ON employee died at the end of the year as a result of poisoning. Each fatal accident is thoroughly investigated so that we understand the exact course of events that led to it. Identifying root causes enables us to take the measures necessary to prevent similar accidents in future. Nevertheless, serious and even fatal accidents still occur. E.ON cannot and will not accept this. It has therefore further intensified its efforts to prevent accidents. Examples are the Company's decision to extend the evaluation of\n\nHSE maturity to all E.ON DSOs and to make adjustments to the HSE Strategy Roadmap, which place a greater emphasis on risk and contractor management (see 'Goals and Performance Review' above).\n\n## NonCore Business: Occupational Health and Safety at PreussenElektra\n\nE.ON's subsidiary PreussenElektra ('PEL') is responsible for the operation, decommissioning, and dismantling of the Company's nuclear power plants ('NPPs'). Its top priorities in all these activities are the health and safety of employees -its own as well a s contractors' -and environmental protection. PEL is fully integrated into E.ON's safety organization and is subject to its high standards. PEL's extensive experience in plant operations and decommissioning helps it further optimize its H SE processes and pr ocedures. As there were no serious accidents in 2022, we remain convinced of PEL's high safety standards.",

E.ON's human resources ('HR') creates the conditions for all employees to make their contribution. The HR function's cornerstones are: attracting great people, developing people, creating a winning cul ture, and driving digital. They are part of E.ON's HR management vision. First, by being an attractive employer E.ON wants to attract creative talent for a good and innovative energy world. Second, our employees should be able to learn anytime and anywher ein their daily work, interaction with others, and formal training courses. In addition, E.ON's objective is to establish a culture of inclusion in which all employees can realize their potential and feel valued. Finally, we aim to make HR processes and to ols as digital as possible and to foster a digital mindset.\n\nThe medium -term HR objectives specify this overarching vision as it is reflected in our Group People Strategy, or GPS@E.ON. This strategy defines the four Group -wide People Priorities: the future of work, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, and leadership. HR activities across the Group are aligned with GPS@E.ON and must fundamentally contribute to the People Priorities and their respective key ambitions. The strategy is implemented through Groupwide and local activities, in particular by means of existing strategic initiatives. The entire implementation process is flexible and modular in order to reflect differences between business units. \u25c4\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 2-30\n\nA common culture, toward which the Company continually works, is crucial for E.ON's success. Five fundamental corporate values guide employees' actions and interactions with each other, customers, and business partners: Putting our customer first,\n\nBetter together, Delivering on our promises, Exploring new paths, and Behaving mindfully.\n\nIn addition, Grow@E.ON, E.ON's Group -wide competency model, is an integral part of GPS@E.ON  and defines the specific behaviors to which the Company is committed. It is integrated into all HR -related processes and describes how employees and managers should behave toward each other and customers. It also provides guidance to staff in their daily work and sets out a clear path for their personal development and professional growth . Grow@E.ON's purpose is to enable us to recruit the right employees for the right positions, retain them, and foster their ongoing development. In addition, our competency model is designed to enable us to provide targeted and appreciative feedback on their performance, thereby helping to ensure E.ON's future success as well. Grow@E.ON enables the Company to offer a variety of career paths and opportunities. The purpose is to make E.ON an attractive employer -for people who want a specialist career as well as for those who want to broaden their horizons. Grow@E.ON is designed to prepare the Company for the continually evolving world of work, in which agility, future -oriented skills, and greater individualization and diversity are at the forefront. The model, which was revised in 2020, is updated on a regular basis. All new managers and employees are informed about Grow@E.ON and trained accordingly.\n\nWe are currently designing a new process for competence and skills management that will help us automatically recognize skills that are critical for the future; the process will also continuously indicate missing skills and learning needs to departments, managers, and employees.\n\nE.ON aims to provide fair pay that enables our employees to live a decent life. Whenever possible, it offers permanent employment.\n\n\u203a 83 percent of employees are covered by a collective -bargaining agreement, and 94 percent have a permanent employee contract. \u2039\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe Group Policy FP -09 (Functional Policy Group HR/Executive HR) specifies the responsibilities of Group HR and Executive HR and their respective tasks. Executive HR, for example, is responsible for the complete life -cycle management of the top 100 executives. The policy details the company -wide instruments for which Group HR is responsible. These include executive compensation including the grading framework, the Grow@E.ON competency model, the employer value proposition ('EVP'), Groupwide diversity targets, global learning technologies and content, the expat policy, the pension framework, and global HR IT governance.\n\nE.ON has a variety of policies and directives in place, including agreements for home offices and rules on flexible work arrangements such as sabbaticals, part -time work, and special leave. The principles are supported by our codetermination committees and are binding for the entire E.ON Group. The units implement them according to their respective legal, cultural, a nd business circumstances.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON's HR work has been largely decentralized since 2018 so that it is closer to the business. In September 2022 E.ON decided to adapt its predominantly decentralized HR governance model: additi onal topics with a Group -wide value proposition in talent management/diversity and inclusion, learning and development, EVP, and HR tech are to be managed and implemented more centrally. In this context, the Senior Vice President Group HR/Executive HR will set Group -wide annual targets for the HR leaders of the individual units. E.ON will start to implement the process in 2023.\n\nAn important task of the central HR function is HR management for the Company's senior leadership positions. This includes leadership development, staffing, succession planning, and long -term talent management. There is also a central framework to",

The framework encompasses overarching criteria for talent potential and common tools such as talent boards. Units in each country can adapt and expand the framework to ensure it meets their specific needs and challenges.\n\nThe Management Board discusses the current status of talent development on a regular basis and gets a picture of the entire talent pool, including lower management levels, once or twice a year. The global approach to talent management includes regular talent board meetings at the unit and Group level. HR and the departments use the meetings to share information about talented employees and their development needs.\n\nE.ON takes its employees' interests very seriously and cooperates closely employee representatives. Almost all E.ON units and Corporate Functions itself have works councils or other forms of employee representation. We can build on the long -standing, constructive, and trusting partnership with employee representatives, especially in times of change; moreover, we actively involve the workforce in all upcoming changes.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\n## GRI 404-2\n\nFlexible work arrangements have been part of E.ON's corporate culture for many years. In view of the Covid -19 pandemic, E.ON established hybrid work as a Group -wide standard. We did this to make working at E.ON even more attractive and to position our company as a modern employer in the future as well .\n\nIn addition to the benefits of the company pension scheme or employer -financed accident insurance, E.ON supports its employees in non -work -related situations or in special life situations, such as when a family member falls ill. Employees in Germany, for example, can take advantage of various services provided or arranged by the Company. These services range from\n\nstress and addiction counselling to support in caring for elderly or sick relatives. Employees who fall ill for more than six weeks within a 12month period receive help with reintegration. In granting these benefits no distinction is made between full -time and parttime employment.\n\nTraining and development are likewise important for E.ON's attractiveness as an employer. All employees receive train ing at their onboarding, HSE training, and functional training relevant to their role as well as soft -skills training and access to talent and leadership development programs. These include many digital, self -directed learning opportunities that employees can access from anywhere at any time. In addition to Group -wide training opportunities, the units have standardized digital learning o fferings. E.ON uses them for onboarding new employees and in part for training strategically important topics like digitalization or health and safety. To simplify their learning, employees can take learner journeys on specific specialist topics. The journeys are offered by the central HR function's People Development Team and the Digital Empowerment Team. Currently, each department is conducting projects to develop strategically important learning content. This involves identifying critical skills and learning needs in line with E.ON's strategy and external market requirements. During the year under review, for example, we identified the core competencies our employees need to manage our digital transformation. We conduct upskilling journeys to establish the necessary digital skills in -house. These journeys are training modules with personalized learning offerings that are tai lored to the roles and training needs in question.\n\nE.ON believes that the most effective way for employees to learn is through experience and practice. The Company adopts a 70 -2010 learning approach: 70 percent of learning happens on the job, 20 percent through social interaction and knowledge sharing with others, and 10 percent by means of programs such as eLearning, seminars, and formal training. E.ON keeps up with the faster pace of the digital age by increasingly replacing long formats with short digi tal learning formats and self -directed learning. It is part of\n\nemployees' workflow, is tailored to their individual needs as much as possible, and is accessible anytime and anywhere. E.ON is currently working to make employees' learning opportunities even more attractive and easier in the future by planning to establish a onestop shop, a uniform platform that hosts all E.ON -wide learning opportunities. In addition, in late 2022 E.ON drew up a catalogue of measures for learning and development. Its purpose is to ensure a new, Group -wide framework for learning and employee development that will be introduced in all units in 2023. It will be accompanied by an internal communications campaign in the years ahead; initial measures are already under way.\n\nE.ON's mechanism for recruiting executives applies across all units. It aims to optimize the filling of executive positions, make the recruitment process more transparent, and ensure equal opportunity. In addition, a biweekly placement conference is held at which HR representatives from the entire Company gather to share vacancies directly below the top executive level and discuss potential candidates.\n\nE.ON helps people launch their careers by offering apprenticeships for various vocations as well as internships, work -study arrangements, and other programs. Our offerings in Germany include local initiatives to help interested people start their careers with the help of school projects, internships, courses, and expert guidance. We also employ work -study students who can gain work experience at E.ON and simultaneously finance their education. In 2022 we also launched a new, Group -wide E.ON International Graduate Program ('EIGP') to develop next -generation talent personally and professionally and to retain them at E.ON. Cross -functional, national, and international assignments enable participants to get to know our business and network Groupwide. We support them with mentoring, coaching, and training. The first class consists of 15 university graduates from a total of six countries. Another will follow in 2023.\n\nOpportunities and offerings for training and development are important to enable employees to perform at a high level, to",

So too is a feedback culture, which is firmly embedded in GPS@E.ON, E.ON's Group -wide HR strategy. E.ON offers its employees periodic performance and development reviews. The Company also takes a number of steps to foster a feedback culture, including offering training, guidelines for feedback, and support on Connect, its in -house social network.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nIn 2022 E.ON's central HR functions began to support its predominantly decentralized HR organization more strongly on issues of Group -wide significance or Group -wide value propositions. In 2023 binding central targets will be set for the first time for topics with a Group -wide value proposition. The HR Board defines, prioritizes, and decides on the specific annual HR targets for the implementation of Group -wide value propositions and their measurement criteria. It consists of the Senior Vice President ('SVP') Group HR and representatives of the local HR organizations. The SVP Group HR is responsible for the final prioritization of the targets, taking into account E.ON's strategy. The targets will be reviewed periodically based on the previously defined measurement criteria.\n\nE.ON wants to retain its people (and their expertise) and enable them to grow professionally. One of E.ON's objectives i s therefore also to fill management positions internally. At talent boards, E.ON's HR representatives use a special tool to assess how many candidates have participated in an application process and who ultimately filled a vacant position. It also enables E.ON to monitor whether selected candidates come from its own development pool and whether they meet its diversity target s. E.ON's talent boards not only focus on identifying talent and planning succession, but, since 2021, also on diversity aspects. The objective is in part to increase the proportion of women and employees from underrepresented groups among managers. That is why, since 2020, E.ON has been strengthening its commitment and has made diversity a People Priority in GPS@E.ON, its HR strategy. In 2022\n\nwe continued gathering data to enable us to assess our talent management's effectiveness.\n\nE.ON has conducted an annual employee survey, known as a Pulse Check, since 2014 to find out how its people feel about their job, their supervisor, the work atmosphere in their unit, and other topics. The survey includes questions about E.ON's corporate values and current topics, such as, in 2022, the energy crisis. E.ON conducted two surveys in 2022 (in January and November), because the 2021 Pulse Check was pos tponed until early 2022.\n\n\u203a An important component of these surveys is Employee Net Promoter Score ('eNPS'): it measures employees' willingness to recommend E.ON as an employer. In the January 2022 survey, eNPS improved by two points (+28). The November 2022 survey again resulted in an eNPS of + 28 . E.ON analyzes survey feedback carefully to identify areas where the Company may need to improve. Employees are also informed about the findings for their particular business unit as well as any measures that may be implemented in response. Alongside the survey, employees have other opportunities to submit feedback, including during live online chats with a member of the E.ON Management Board that are held multiple times each year. \u2039\n\nThe measures launched in 2020 and 2021 to assess even more advanced surveys and technologies led to an implementation plan in mid -2022, which, following a resolution by the Management Board in August 2022, will be rolled out Groupwide by the end of 2024. At the core of the plan is an employee engagement strategy that aims to record and evaluate employee feedback even more frequently. This will enable organizational units such as departments and individual teams to identify and address engagement issues swiftly and independently.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\nGRI 2-7\n\n## Employees: Core Workforce 1\n\n| FTE                       | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Energy Networks           | 38,542 | 38,032 | 39,066 |\n| Customer Solutions        | 25,046 | 26,067 | 29,858 |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | 4,143  | 3,885  | 4,124  |\n| Core Business             | 67,731 | 67,984 | 73,048 |\n| Non- Core Business        | 1,647  | 1,749  | 1,818  |\n| E.ON Group                | 69,378 | 69,733 | 74,866 |\n\n1 Core workforce includes board members and managing directors but excludes apprentices, interns, and work ing students.\n\nAt yearend 2022, the E.ON Group's core workforce had 69,378 employees. This figure includes part -time positions on a pro rata basis. The number of employees decreased slightly -by 355 FTEs, or 1 percentin 2022. The proportion of employees working outside Germany (34,184 FTEs) also decreased slightly to 49 percent compared with year -end 2021 (50 percent).\n\nBy contrast, the number of employees at Energy Networks increased slightly. This was mainly due to growth activities in Germany and Sweden, but also to the filling of vacancies, particularly in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Efficiency measures and restructuring programs in Germany constituted the principal countervailing effect.\n\nCustomer Solutions' core workforce decreased. Restruc turing projects, especially in the United Kingdom and Germany, and the sale of innogy e -Mobility Solutions GmbH were main factors.\n\nThe increase in the number of employees at Corporate Functions/Other was mainly due to the US business of providing charging systems for electric vehicles. The insourcing of human resources for digital functions was another factor.",

This is comparable with the average age at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nother DAX 4 0 companies. The age distribution of E.ON's workforce reflects the demographic trend of working -age people. In 2022 around 21 percent of our employees were under the age of 31, 49 percent between 31 and 50, and around 30 percent older than 50.\n\n## New E mployee Hires and Turnover Rate\n\nGRI 401-1\n\nE.ON hired 9,128 new employees in the year under review . The voluntary turnover rate in 2022 was 6.1 percent, including board members, managing directors, and apprentices ( prior year : 4.5).\n\n## Customer Satisfaction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3\n\nCustomers of all types -households and businesses, cities and government entities -understand that a digital an d decarbonized future means that they will not only consume, but also increasingly make and store their own clean energy. These customers are extremely knowledgeable and discerning. They expect E.ON not only to listen to and anticipate their needs, but also to design innovative and sustainable energy solutions, deliver best -inclass services, and provide a consistently good customer experience. Earning and retaining their trust and loyalty is very significant for us to sustainably grow our business. Loyal customers tend to stay with us longer, to purchase additional products and services, and to recommend us to their family and friends. We have made their expectations our own. Our guiding principle for this commitment is 'Connecting Everyone to Good Energy.'\n\n2022 was a difficult year for our customers: energy prices skyrocketed, making it much harder for people to access affordable and renewable energy. The events also impaired our ability to support economically disadvantaged customers in line with our guiding principle. A team at Corporate Functions analyzed\n\nthe impact of price increases on our customers and the E.ON brand and worked to mitigate this impact by helping our regional businesses successfully adapt their communications and customer service to the situation.\n\nAll E.ON network companies regularly review and optimize their services in response to their customers' concerns. For example, t his enabled us to effectively mitigate potential power disruptions in the winter of 2022 -2023 and maintain a largely stable supply situation for our customers. More information can be found in the Energy Affordability chapter .\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON continually measures and improves the experience we offer to our customers, in order to retain -and, ideally, deepen -their loyalty. It is essential for us to be systematically customer -centric. Because the E.ON brand promises to give our customers what they want in the future energy world: consistently positive experiences within our services and smart, sustainable solutions. E.ON transports energy from where it is produced to where it is needed. We also work to empower people, companies, and cities across Europe to create the sustainable world that they want to live in. The purpose is to build energy communities in which everyone can do their part and meet these needs -from a household opting for green electricity to an entire city committing to sustainability. Delivering on this promise will make the E.ON brand distinctive, and enable us to successfully expand our business. E.ON's objective is to become the number one energy -solutions company in all of its markets.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nIn 2022 E.ON developed new principles for customer experience. These overarching principles provide broad guidance for our regional unit s to design customer journeys and general interactions. They are formulated from the perspective of satisfied customers and reflect the needs E.ON wants to meet in its interactions with them. E.ON:",

We empower them to contribute to a better energy future by showing them how to manage generation and consumption. Choosing E.ON makes them feel part of something bigger, e n route to a sustainable community.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Chief Operating Office -Commercial (' COO-C ') at Corporate Functions coordinates our brand and marketing strategy with the aim of further developing and strengthening the E.ON brand. The COOC supports the sales and energy solutions business for all customer segments and in all E.ON markets. The regional units' Customer Experience Teams are responsible for customer satisfaction. They carry out projects and measures in their respective sales territories and exchange information on successful approaches and progress on a monthly basis. There are Customer Experience Teams in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\nE.ON's Global Customer Leadership team, which consists of senior C ustomer E xperience leaders from the entire Group and re presentatives from the Customer and Market Insights team, successfully continued its work in 2022. Its purpose is to listen to customers more and foster customer centricity in all E.ON markets. The team met four times in the year under review to assess Customer Experience activities, identify areas of focus for cross -regional collaboration, and give customers a stronger voice.\n\nThe Customer and Market Insights team studies which trends shape our customers' attitudes and behaviors. It conducts consumer studies, broad -based market research, and advanced data analyses and models possible scenarios. The aim is to obtain practical knowledge and incorporate it into business processes.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON measures customer loyalty by means of Net Promoter Score ('NPS'), which was introduced in 2009 and became a Group -wide program in 2013. NPS indicates customers' willingness to recommend E.ON and its services. It also helps us identify which issues are currently of particular importance to customers and thus to adapt our activities to current customer needs. E.ON measures two types of NPS:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic NPS compares E.ON's performance with that of its competitors and is based on the feedback of customers r egardless of whether they have had an y interaction with E.ON.\n- \u00b7 Journey NPS measures the loyalty of customers who have completed an experience with us, such as transferring their energy service to their new residence when they move.\n\nNPS is used by our regional units in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\nA methodology introduced in 2017 enables us to measure strategic NPS consistently across all markets and thus to identify\n\nand resolve customer issues experienced in multiple markets. It also makes it easier for us to recognizes the areas in which useful innovations can be offered to customers. The methodology is based on an automated reporting process. It therefore avoids the errors of manual data entry and improves data quality and auditability.\n\nE.ON's Early Warning System ('EWS') examines customer comments and current events in the media and serves as a platform for us to listen and discuss at the Group level as well as in our regio nal teams.\n\nE.ON addressed the price and supply crisis in the winter of 2022 -2023 by establishing a cross -regional program called JOE ('Journey and Operational Excellence'). The aim was to keep our customers' payment experience consistently positive. All r egional units participated in the program to develop solutions for new challenges in payment processing. They shared best practices and worked to digit al ize processes and customer interactions and to improve cost efficiency. We used JOE to tackle two main issues in 2022. The first focus was on price perception and payment. Specifically, this involved the mitigation of price shock, more transparent invoices, more reliable invoice forecasts, and enhanced payment and cost control capabilities for our customers. The second focus was on improving users' experience with our digital channels. The primary effort was to reduce the effort required for customers to interact with E.ON. More information can be found in the Energy Affordability chapter.\n\nWe also refined our brand positioning in 2022 and made it clearer what E.ON stands for: our core message is the brand promise 'Connecting Everyone to Good Energy.' E.ON's distribution networks form the backbone and foundation of the future energy world. They enable us to deliver on our brand promise by seizing the opportunities of an increasingly self -managing, growing ecosystem consisting of distributed generators, storage operators, and consumers that depend on strong and stable networks. We thus not only ensure the most efficient use of green power, but",

This enables us to meet the challenges of climate change and bring about the energy transition in Europe together with our customers and business partners.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nEvery year, E.ON sets company -wide targets for strategic and journey NPS. E.ON uses both indicators at the segment and unit level for purposes of management control. Strategic NPS is highly relevant for management control because of the information it provides about competitors. The E.ON Management Board has received a monthly NPS report since September 2020. In addition, perio dic market reports enable the Chief Operating Office -Commercial and the CEOs of the regional units to exchange views on NPS issues and customer topics. NPS also plays a role in executives' variable compensation. This consists of two components: one factor reflects an executive's individual performance, the other the c ompany performance. Progress in strategic and journey NPS has accounted for 20 percent of the calculation of the c ompany performance since 2020. The achievement of NPS targets is also factored into determining the E.ON Management Board's compensation. In 2022 this was the case for the first time.\n\nSince 2017, each unit has also established its own measures to systematically improve customer perception. These activities are initiated and overseen by the units' CEO and board members because they are personally responsible for their unit's NPS performance. They review the measures annually and readjust them. They increasingly include sustainability criteria. The measures' duration can cover a period of several years, depending on the scope of the planned adjustments.\n\n## Community Involvement\n\nGRI 3-3\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is part of the countries and communities where it does business. We therefore feel obliged to make a contribution to their prosperity, economic development, sustainability, and quality of life. We do this primarily by creating jobs and by offering ene rgy solutions that enhance our customers' sustainability and comfort. In addition, E.ON engages in community involvement and supports employee volunteering in all regions where it operates.\n\nOur unit representatives know their country's needs and challenges best. So E.ON lets them decide which projects and organizations to support. We believe that local decision -making is more suitable than central directives for giving our community involvement activities a societal impact.\n\nIn order to better coordinate Groupwide and regional activities as well as the commitment of the E.ON Foundation and to increase its social impact, we have bundled E.ON SE's and the E.ON Foundation's activities and linked them more closely. In this way, we want to ensure that responsibility for content coordination, decisions on projects, and process design lies in one hand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Community Investments\n\nE.ON reports its corporate giving by the categories below .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside corporate giving, E.ON makes strategic investments in community involvement, which are typically more long -term in nature. In 2022 the financial resources for sponsorships went toward three focus areas: climate protection, access to energy, and educational support for the next generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON's corporate giving and strategic community involvement totaled around \u20ac18 million in 2022 ( prior year : \u20ac12 million).",

Guided by the conviction that a purely government -mandated, over -regulated energy transition will not succeed, it supports projects, events, and practical formats relating to energy and society. In 2022 the foundation made about \u20ac42,000 in donations and provided more tha n \u20ac2 million in funding to the projects it supports. Because the foundation is independent, this funding is not included in E.ON's community investments.\n\n## Corporate Volunteering\n\nE.ON's employees were again actively involved in non -profit projects across Europe in 2022 . In total, 2 , 273 E.ON employees performed 13,340 hours of volunteer work in 2022. This figure may include d oublecounting of employees who volunteer more than once .\n\n## Data Protection, Cybersecurity, and Product Safety\n\nGRI 3-3, GRI 418\n\nE.ON processes personal data of a variety of stakeholders, primarily customers, employees, enterprise partners, and suppliers. We have a Groupwide data protection organization, which we continually improve. E.ON evaluates its processing activities on an ongoing basis in order to comply with the law and to protect data subjects' rights and personal data. In addition, E.ON has comprehensive measures to ensure cybersecurity, in particular at Energy Networks and Customer Solutions. The aim is to efficiently protect systems and data regardless of where they are accessed from, which devices are used, and where the data are processed. Safeguarding all company information -in oral, written, and digital form -is crucial in order to prevent damage to E.ON competitive position, brand, and reputation.\n\nE.ON offers its customers digital solutions (like the E.ON Home app and the E.ON Drive app) as well as a steadily expanding range of products installed at their premises. This includes solar and battery storage systems, heating systems (including heat pumps and boilers), and electric -vehicle charging points. Ensuring that these products are safe is essential for E.ON to protect its customers' health, retain their trust, and continue to serve them successfully.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is committed to protecting the rights of the individual (customer, employee, supplier, or other third party) in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and national laws: in principle, individuals themselves may determine the disclosure and use of their personal data. E.ON Group's Data Protection Management System ('DPMS') is an orientation and implementation aid on issues related to data protection. It is based on IDW PS 980, an audit standard for compliance management systems. The DPMS ensures a structured, coordinated, and consistent approach to data protection across the entire Company; it was audited by a law firm. In 2022 internal audits of several E.ON units regarding the status of their data protection management were conducted. These audits confirmed the DPMS's effectiveness and E.ON's compliance with the GDPR. In addition, E.ON studied major data breach cases at other companies that became public and used these insights to further improve its own data protection and IT security measures and to harden its IT infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022 E.ON revised its data protection contracts, in particular EU model clauses, and other documents relevant to data protection . Among other things, E.ON focused on implementing and updating contra cts for third -country transfers and assessments of the level of protection in the third country (transfer impact assessment). Data protection is an ongoing task amid rapidly evolving technologies and practices. Using the plan -docheck -act ('PDCA') method e nables E.ON to continually improve these processes (for\n\nmore information, see 'Goals and Performance Review' below). These activities will continue in 2023.\n\nTo protect all company information, E.ON has in place an Information Security Management System ('ISMS') based on the standards of the ISO 2700x series, widely recognized international standards for information security. The ISMS is certified for those parts of the organization where this is required by law. E.ON works to ensure and maintain the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its information resources. This includes monitoring infrastructure, vulnerabilities, and threats as well as detecting and responding to security events like cyberattacks. In 2022 E.ON updated its cybersecurity strategy and designed a roadmap for implementing it. Items on the roadmap include improving security awareness, identity and access management, cloud security, and new detection and prevention capabilities.\n\nE.ON extend its high standards for occupational health and safety to the products it offers customers. The Company sets uniform standards to ensure that its products are safe throughout their life cycle, from development to recycling. Our ambition is to comply fully with all existing laws and regulations. This applies likewise to applicable safety laws and regulations. If, in the case of innovative products, current laws and regulations lag behind the state of the art, E.ON meets more stringent safety standards. Due to confidentiality constraints and the sensitivity of such data, E.ON cannot provide information about complaints concerning data breaches, regardless of whether these complaints were substantiated or not.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's Data Protection Policy defines roles and responsibilities in a uniform manner across the whole Group. The information security standards introduced in 2018, which are based on the ISO 2700x series of standards, apply to the entire Group as well. The y enable E.ON employees to design and operate new solutions with the required level of cybersecurity and to protect technology, data as well as customers, critical infrastructure, and society from",

E.ON's People Guideline summarizes the most important cybersecurity rules relevant for all employees.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nEach unit in the Group is responsible for compl ying with the GDPR and integra ting the DPMS. E.ON has established processes across the Group to comply with data protection requirements, for example to respond to data subject inquiries and report data protection breaches. This set of processes also provides guidance when individual units introduce or update their processes in their organization .\n\nThe units are responsible for responding to all requests from data subjects, such as access to information on data processing, rectification, deletion, and data portability. The units' systems and policies must also comply with their national data protection laws and reg ulations and those of any other countries where they operate. Where required by law, the units have appointed Data Protection Officers ('DPOs'). The units' DPOs work closely together and report regularly to the Chief DPO, in particular on information relating to legal and regulatory developments and fines, the protection of data subjects' rights, relations to third parties, fulfilment of documentation duties, and correspondence with supervisory authorities.\n\nE.ON's Chief DPO is responsible for data protection issues at the Group level; for example, he coordinates E.ON's data protection activities. He also reports periodically to the Cyber Security and Data Protection Council, which also includes Management Board members, and to the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, the DPOs and employees are informed on a regular basis about relevant developments related to data protection . These include legislation, technology, and decisions issued by data protection authorities. This information is d isseminated by email and through internal communications channels, such as the corporate intranet.\n\nThe Cybersecurity function prevents technology and information from having an adverse impact on E.ON's business and customers. Its tasks include designing a Groupwide cybersecurity strategy, monitoring its implementation, and coordinating the cybersecurity organization across E.ON. E.ON's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') oversees the Group -wide cybersecurity organization and assigned to the Management Board's digital remit. His responsibilities include formulating E.ON's cybersecurity strategy and monitoring its implementation. The Group -wide cybersecurity organization includes Information Security Officers ('ISOs') appointed by the business units. They report to the CISO as well as to their unit's board on all relevant matters arising in their organizations. The CISO reports on regular basis -as well as ad hoc in the event of serious security incidents -to the E.ON SE Management Board and the Supervisory Board. These vertical and horizontal reporting pathways ensure transparent and consistent reporting.\n\nE.ON's regional units know their customers, their products, and the local market conditions and requirements. Consequently, their Product Development teams take the lead in product safety, supported by their unit's Health, Safety, and Environment ('HSE') department. They also work closely with several divisions and departments at Corporate Functions, primarily B2C/B2SME Solution Management, Innovation, HSE, and Sustainability. In addition, B2C has its own product safety and compliance team.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON provides data protection training to its employees every two to three years. New employees in all countries receive data protection training in their first year as part of their onboarding process. In addition, E.ON conducts specific training for entities and departments -such as call centers and sales organizations -that process more personal data. Employees use an eLearning module to familiarize themselves with the GDPR's rules annually. As of year -end 2022, more than 81 percent of employees had completed the module.\n\nE.ON uses eLearning, phishing simulations, and inhouse workshops such as live hacking demonstrations to familiarize its employees with cybersecurity risks and their obligation to keep confidential company information secure. To enable its employees to handle information properly, E.ON uses a classification tool, including electronic document labelling, which was introduced in 2022. E.ON conducted a phishing awareness campaign that involved simulated phishing emails sent to employees on several days in 2022. In addition, E.ON periodically performs p enetrationtesting for crucial services in order to further harden key services against cyberattacks.\n\nE.ON takes a variety of steps to address health and safety issues across the entire life cycle of its products. During product development, E.ON closely observes current standards and guidelines and monitors emerging issues. The regional units test all market -ready products, including eMobility solutions, for CE/UKCA conformity in their own test labs or have them tested in E.ON's test lab in Essen or by outside testing firms. Products that are CEcompliant meet EU -wide requirements for safety, health, and environmental protection, while UKCA -compliant products meet the British market's compliance requirements. This provides E.ON with a comprehensive assessment of risks, their likelihood, and other potential implications. Contractors who install and maintain products on E.ON's behalf must undergo prequalification prior to hiring to ensure that they meet specific standards and values. In addition, E.ON engages in ongoing dialogue with its contractors and trains them to ensure that they adhere to all requirements and the latest technical standards. Safety training, for example, is mandatory for all installers of solar and battery solutions in Germany. If a product has a safety -related issue, E.ON needs to be able to recall it immediately. E.ON therefore checks and tracks all hardware product changes so that it can contact customers immediately in the event of safety -related issue. We work to continually improve these processes.\n\nWhenever E.ON is the product manufacturer or deemed to be such, the Company is legally obliged to comply with a number of",

These include establishing a systems to ensure product traceability and putting in place a plan for corrective measures. Other requirements include product certification, CE/UKCA labeling, the issuance of E.ON's own EU/UKCA Declaration of Conformity, and the creation and maintenance of a product's full technical documentation. In the event of safety -related i ssues, E.ON immediately informs the appropriate market surveillance agency about the issue and the intended corrective measures, such as withdrawal, warning, and recall. E.ON is also obligated to take necessary corrective actions.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe recurring PDCA cycle results in the DPMS's processes being continually planned, implemented, managed, and improved. This enables E.ON to permanently monitor the DPMS's effectiveness, proactively and repeatedly look for potential blind spots, and take action if need for improvement arises. E.ON units report on the status quo of their compliance with the GDPR on a quarterly basis. The review also includes regular assessments by Group Audit. The units implement Group Audit's recommendations in a timely manner. Where it was possible to conclude ongoing proceedings with data protection agencies, this was done without sanctions. The existing DPMS is therefore effective and robust.\n\nE.ON assesses the maturity of its ISMS domains regularly and reports the findings to the Cyber Security and Data Protection Council on a quarterly basis. E.ON defined a minimum maturity level for all areas and units. If deficiencies or improvement potential are identified, E.ON adjusts its cybersecurity roadmaps accordingly.\n\nProd uct safety incidents are documented at the unit whose product was involved and at the Group level. The investigation and analysis of such incidents help us identify their causes and determine how to prevent them in future. E.ON shares the insights gained i n this process with all relevant departments.\n\n## Business Resilience Management GRI 3-3\n\nThe health, safety, and security of employees and customers, environmental protection, and the reliability of the energy supply are particularly important to E.ON. We work continually to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of our infrastructure and customer solutions and to become even more resilient to operational interruptions and disruptions. If a crisis occurs despite comprehensive precautions, E.ON responds swiftly and handles the situation professionally.\n\nThe impact of the Russia -Ukraine war in particular prese nted a new challenge in 2022. Among other things, we faced a potential energy shortage and an overall increased threat to energy infrastructure. By contrast, the implications of the Covid -19 pandemic were less drasti c than in prior years. E.ON was able to manage them by means of its regular organizational processes and continued to implement its established infection -control measures systematically and on a risk -adjusted basis.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON has in place a comprehensive framework consisting of various minimum requirements for the purpose of conducting business resilience management. It addresses standard security issues and includes specifications for implementing crisis and business continuity management. Nevertheless, the Company cannot rule out the possibility of crises caused by, for example, a natural disaster, human or technical failure, a cyberattack, a security -related incident, or some other event. That is why integrated business continuity management encompasses, for example, elaborate contingency plans. They specify both organizational and operational measures to enable a fast, efficient, and predefined response. In the event of a crisis, E.ON has a Groupwide crisis organization with several highly specialized crisis management teams; they conduct exercises on a regular basis in order to be able to respond quickly to critical events. E.ON\n\nprepares thoroughly to respond to such exceptional situations in the best possible way and prevent escalation and acts quickly and purposefully at the first signs. The main objective of crisis prevention and management measures is to protect human life, the environment, the business, and property. This approach has demonstrated its worth in past crises.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's Business Resilience corporate function policy defines responsibilities and roles as well as organizational requirements and provides recommendations on how the units can establish, operate, and continually refine an effective business resilience management system. The E.ON SE Management Board is responsible for approv ing the function policy. The policy's theme encompasses the following overarching areas of operational resilience: physical security, business continuity management, emergency and crisis management, and travel security. In addition, the policy requires the units to report critical incidents, serious security incidents, and incidents with crisis potential to the Security Response Center, which is operational at all times. These requirements make it possible to manage unp redictable and complex situations that could have a significant impact on E.ON's business, assets, stakeholders, and/or reputation. To the degree necessary, the Group supports the units in establishing the mechanisms and implementing the issues. The Group -wide Business Resilience Community provides additional support and information sharing. More information on the Business Resilience Community can be found below under 'Specific Actions.'\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nUltimate responsibility for preventing and managing crises lies with the E.ON Management Board. The strategic implementation of physical security issues is carried out by the Business Resilience function, which is part of the Legal, Compliance, and Security department. With the exceptional of travel security, operational implementation at the business units is conducted by their business resilience managers. Alongside this regular organization,",

It is divided into the respective operational business/regional level and at the Group level. The Security Response Center is the central reporting point for crises and emergencies.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nTo be able to respond to crisis even more swiftly, E.ON designs and conducts several realistic crisis simulations and training courses each year. In 2022 E.ON conducted four Group -wide crisis simulations in national and international environments, several local crisis exercises at business units, and ongoing training and continuing education for designated crisis management teams. All members of these teams are required to participate in regular training and continuing education. In addition, all members of the crisis management team receive a one -time onboarding training sessions for their respective functions as well as additional training if required. Among other things, crisis team leaders are trained to lead a team in complex, stressful, time -critical, and uncertain situations.\n\nIn addition to crisis management activities, the Business Resilience function conducts other measures to enable E.ON to achieve lasting operational resilience. For example, the Business Resilience Community provides a forum in which representatives of the function, all security managers, and business resilience managers engage in dialog on a regular basis. If needed, other stakeholders (HSE, Cyber Security, Risk Management, outside experts) are involved. At meetings, participants share information and curre nt insights from threat situations and security incidents, including at short notice, in order to learn from each other and develop joint solutions in the medium and long term. The Business Resilience Community began meeting monthly in 2022, instead of onc e a quarter as in the two previous years, in order to increase the maturity of the individual security topics more evenly at all units.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON relies on valuable security expertise and has effective services and networks to ensure that its operating business can be continuously maintained. This enables the Company to continually increase its own operational resilience. E.ON has set the following objectives for this purpose:\n\nCrisis management enables E.ON to identify crises at an e arly stage and respond to them swiftly and effectively and to ensure it has the necessary capabilities in place Groupwide. The aim is also to conduct regular checks to make sure that the necessary infrastructure is in place and up to date. The Company als o assesses, documents, and uses findings from all crisis management training, simulations, and actual incidents to design and implement improvement measures.\n\nBusiness continuity management is designed to ensure that E.ON can deal with emergencies and continue operating in the event of an emergency. For this purpose, a business impact analysis must examine all critical processes at least once a year. Its findings are used to design, update, and test business continuity plans and solutions.\n\nE.ON uses its Grou pwide services and business resilience processes to minimize employees' travel risks. The aim is to ensure safety and security regardless of the travel destination.\n\nOur objective for physical security is to protect our employees, property, and assets. E.ON conducts security risk analyses for this purpose; depending on their findings, the Company designs and implements physical security plans and solutions.\n\nIn the year under review, the change in the global security situation and an adjusted strategy (the digital strategy, for example) were among the factors that made it clear that E.ON needs to raise its awareness of business resilience issues and enhance collaboration and information sharing. If necessary at any point, we will create additional tools and frameworks that will\n\nmake the Company as a whole more resilient. These initiatives will be coordinated with relevant stakeholders and senior management . As part of this, the Business Resilience function at E.ON SE is to become more active as a second line of defense.\n\n## Crisis Prevention at NonCore Business\n\nPreussenElektra ('PEL') is only allowed to operate a nuclear power plant ('NPP') if it can demonstrate that it has taken all practicable steps to prevent a severe accident. PEL demonstrates its compliance on an ongoing basis to the relevant authorities, such as the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the Reactor Safety Commission, and state -level agencies.\n\nIn 2022 there were no known safety -related incidents that significantly affected the safety level at PEL's NPPs. They remained at the normal long -term safety level. On average, ten to 15 reportable events per year occur at PEL's NPPs. PEL headquarters conducts periodic reviews in which it discusses incidents and the findings derived from them with the NPPs that are in operation and those being dismantled. In line with Germany's nuclear ordinances and regulations, the incidents, findings, and any measures taken in response are communicated to state and federal authorities.\n\nPEL regularly conducts statutory nuclear emergency and crisis exercises, notifies Business Resilience Management at E.ON SE , and reports on its results.",

We are committed to ensuring that laws are strictly obeyed and that integrity and compliance are systematically promoted as core components of our corporate culture. This is the only way for us to retain and deepen ou r stakeholders' trust for the long term.\n\nNegligence or deliberate violations could lead to fines and criminal prosecution for the employees in question and could harm E.ON's reputation. Corruption is unacceptable for another reason as well: it leads to decisions being made for the wrong reasons. It can thus impede progress and innovation, distort competition and do lasting damage to E.ON and its stakeholders .\n\nWe therefore take potential compliance violations very seriously. If they are substantiated, we systematically pursue and punish them. E.ON's approach to compliance and anti -corruption is applicable for all business units and Corporate Functions and extends to suppliers as well. Information on compliance notices can be found in the 'Progress and Measures' section below.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is committed to combating corruption in all its manifestations and supports national and international efforts directed against it. The Company's participation in the United Nations Global Compact underscores its rejection of any form of corruption. The E.ON Management Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that E.ON conducts its business legally and at all times refrains from criminal practices in achieving its business objectives. To ensure this for all business units, we have established a central compliance function. Its task is to support\n\nthe E.ON Management Board in its responsibility to prevent, detect, and eliminate corporate crime.\n\nE.ON has in place a compliance management system ('CMS') to mitigate the risk of compliance violations. The CMS is based on a number of widely recognized practices, including measures to foster a compliance culture and a commitment to compliance targets (see 'Goals and Performance Review'). It also enables us to identify and analyze compliance risks, design a risk -adequate compliance program, and expand our compliance organization.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nBoth our Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of Conduct (both of which are available in the languages of all countries in which we operate) focus on our guiding principle, 'Doing the right thing.' They provide easy -tounderstand guidance for all areas that are relevant to E.ON. These include human rights, anti -corruption, fair competition, and compliant relationships with business partners. The E.ON Code of Conduct also contains an integrity test that employees can use to check whether they are doing the right thing. All employees are obligated under their employment contract to act in accordance with the Code of Conduct's rules. In addition, ten People Guidelines, which apply to all business units, explain in detail how employees can be sure that they are doing things right. Our Code of Conduct is widely recognized by experts. In 202 1 , for example, it was awarded the highest mark among all DAX companies by the quarterly magazine of BCM, a professional association for compliance managers in Germany.\n\nAn important People Guideline that supports the Code of Conduct addresses anti -corruption. It contains a decision -making scheme that uses the familiar green, amber, and red of traffic lights to indicate when accepting or granting offers or gifts is permissible, potentially problematic, or forbidden. Gratuities (such as donations and sponsorships) above a certain threshold, which varies by national law, must be approved by the local Compliance Officer. Particularly strict requirements apply to invitations and gifts from public, elected, or government officials and their representatives. The Code of Conduct clearly states E.ON's prohibition against company donations to political\n\nparties, political candidates, political officeholders, or representatives of public agencies.\n\nE.ON's Compliance Function Policy defines basic compliance structures, roles, and responsibilities.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON refines and optimizes its CMS on an ongoing basis. Pursuant to the Compliance Function Policy, we have established a Group -wide organizational setup for this purpose. It consists of the Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO'), the Global Head of Compliance & Data Protection along with his Group Compliance team, and the business units' compliance officers. The CCO reports on a quarterly basis to the E.ON Management Board and to the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee on the CMS's effectiveness and current developments and incidents. In the event of serious incidents, the Management Board and the Audit and Risk Committee are informed without delay. Suspected fraudulent activities directed against the Company are investigated by the internal audit department (Group Audit). The central Group Compliance function is responsible for investigating fraud within the Company .\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nIn 2022 we continued to make eLearning courses available to all employees and managers Group -wide. They are offered by a variety of departments. The curriculum's topics include compliance and anticorruption as well as other legal areas such as data protection, cybersecurity, and human rights. Since 2010 all employees have had to complete a Code of Conduct eLearning module on a regular basis. Employees in units without internet access receive this training in written form and also at a face -toface event.\n\nSince 2021, new employees must complete a new joiner eLearning module along with the module on the E.ON Code of Conduct. It familiarizes them with company rules and whom to contact if they have questions or feel uncertain about a decision. In addition, new",

Such compliance risk assessments ('CRAs') are conducted on an ongoing basis. CRAs employ various methods, ranging from spreadsheet -style questionnaires to personal (and confidential, if applicable) discussions with executives and employees. Based on the findings, Group Compliance determines whether specific measures need to be taken to amend and refine the CRAs in order to appropriately address any (new) potential risks identified.\n\nIn addition, Group Compliance continually engages in dialogue with the compliance officers appointed by local units' management and monitors their work. If employees suspect misconduct or a violation of laws or company policies, they are instructed to report it. For this purpose, they may use -if they prefer, anonymously -internal reporting channels or an IT -based whistle -blower hotline. The system is available Group -wide and can be accessed via the E.ON homepage or by telephone. Not only E.ON employees, but also business partners, their employees, and other third parties can contact the hotline confidentially. Group Compliance forwards the information to the relevant department or unit.\n\nE.ON wants to ensure that its compliance standards are adhered to in its supply chain as well. We therefore subject potential suppliers to a compliance check to assess whether they act in accordance with our values and principles. To ensure that they meet our compliance standards, we also conduct a prequalification process to verify potential suppliers' identity and integrity. This includes, for example, determining whether a supplier appears in the media in connection with compliance issues such as corruption or on an official sanction and terrorism lists. In some cases, potential suppliers must also complete a questionnaire, which E.ON evaluates carefully. Prequalification is mandatory for all new suppliers. The Human Rights and Suppl y\n\nOur Know Your Counterparty ('KYC') principle also defines minimum requirements for certain business partners and scenarios, other than suppliers. The KYC check is an IT -supported workflow that helps us verify counterparties' integrity and avoid legal, regulatory, and reputational risks related to compliance issues such as corruption, money -laundering, tax evasion, violation of economic sanctions, and terrorism financing. It is covered in our Know Your Counterparty People Guideline.\n\nE.ON is a member of a variety of compliance organizations. One example is the German Institute for Compliance (whose German acronym is DICO), where E.ON also serves as Vice Chairman of DICO's Criminal Law Working Group. DICO's mission is to promote the role of compliance and the establishment of recognized compliance standards in cor porate governance in Germany. The institute also serves as a networking platform for compliance experts in and outside Germany. In keeping with strong belief that an effective CMS requires an interdisciplinary approach and an understanding of decision maki ng within organizations, in 2021 E.ON started a new DICO working group devoted to behavioral compliance and ethics.\n\nWe conducted surveys and intervention studies in the Group in 2022. They were part of an interdisciplinary project with the Max Weber Institute for Sociology at Heidelberg University, the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, and its spinoff, Simply Rational GmbH. One of the topics investigated is how altered situation assessments (interventions) can influence the acceptance an d efficiency of preventive compliance measures. The findings will be presented and implemented in 2023.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nWe continuously evaluate the CMS's effectiveness to ensure that E.ON is able to prevent, detect, and take appropriate remedial action against illegal or criminal conduct or other rules violations. The CMS's effectiveness is monitored by the E.ON Management Board, the\n\nSupervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee, and also Group Audit. The latter, an independent entity, is the third line of defense of E.ON's CMS.\n\nThe CMS's effectiveness depends on how serious and credible our compliance efforts within the Company are. This is reflected by, for example, the resources we devote to compliance as well as the quality, control, and monitoring of our measures. Evaluating E.ON's compliance culture and the perception of its compliance is also relevant for the CMS's effectiveness. Special consideration is given to violations that lead to an internal audit. The audit determines whether a violation resulted from negligence or misconduct by an individual or individuals or from shortcomings in the CMS. We use the findings to implement measures to avoid similar incidents in future. The Management Board and the Audit and Risk Committee are convinced that the CMS was again effective in 2022. Their assessment was based in part on audits as well as surveys of employees and stakeholders.\n\nThe CMS at E.ON is structured and follows a uniform roadmap with defined steps for refining our business units' compliance measures. All Compliance Officers must present the status of their unit's compliance roadmap regularly to their board and to Group Compliance. The implementation of the compliance roadmap in 2022 proceeded as planned .\n\nIn 2022 our annual employee survey asked employees who had contacted Group Compliance regarding Code of Conduct violations for feedback about their experiences. We used it to assess Group Compliance's readiness to address such violations or behaviors and to determine whether the information in our Group -wide People Guidelines is appropriate. The findings indicated that most respondents trust E.ON's compliance professionals and feel protected when reporting unethical behavior.",

E.ON adjusted the categories in 2021, which limits the data's comparability with 2020 . Sin ce then, E.ON divides compliance notices into four categories: business integrity concerns, fraud against the C ompany concerns, HR -related concerns, and other concerns related to the Code of Conduct. The resulting investigations found that none of the incidents reported was serious.\n\n## Fines for non -compliance\n\nE.ON paid a total of about \u20ac365,000 in fines for non -compliance with laws in Romania and for PreussenElektra in 2022. Of this figure, 97 percent was for anti -competitive practices in Romania's gas market (prior year: 98 percent) .\n\n## Energy Affordability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3\n\nSince the Russia -Ukraine war began, energy has increasingly played a role in power politics. This presents E.ON with more challenges alongside those posed by the energy transition. One thing is certain: the energy supply must remain reliable, secure, and affordable for industry and consumers. E.ON's long -standing approach is for its business to meet societal expectations regarding energy by pursuing three objectives simultaneously: climate protection, security of supply, and affordability. The public's interest, however, is shifting noticeably toward affordability. E.ON therefore advocates swift and decisive action by policymakers and the energy industry to ensure that energy remains available and affordable for all.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nTo ensure fair prices for our customers and avoid short -term price spikes, we generally procure energy in advance. However, we cannot permanently insulate ourselves from market developments and must factor all cost components into our pricing -both when these components fall and rise. Procurement prices for the C ompany increased significantly in 2022. This is now affecting our customers as well, who need to expect additional expenditures.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the related supply cuts and uncertainties have temporarily disrupted electricity and gas prices in Europe to an extent that far exceeds typical market reactions. The markets have become part of the political conflict. E.ON therefore believes that it would be sensible to find a (social) policy solution or at least to initiate measures to support the businesses and consumers that have been impacted. During the legislative process, E.ON called for the mechanisms to\n\ncompensate gas and power suppliers to be as consistent, pragmatic, and legally secure as possible. In particular, liquidity risks and a high administrative workload should be avoided.\n\nThe dramatic developments necessitated rapid action by policymakers, above all to ensure secure and affordable supplies for industry and consumers. Taxes, levies, and surcharges still account for a large portion of energy costs. A reduction in energy taxes and levies was therefore the obvious choice. That is why we welcomed t he elimination of Germany's renewables surcharge effective July 2022 and the reduction of the VAT on natural gas to 7 percent effective October 2022. We also believe that the amendment of the Fuel Emissions Trading Act was necessary. The amendment enabled lawmakers to postpone for one year the next level of increase in Germany's carbon price for heating oil, natural gas, and fossil fuels, which had been scheduled for the beginning of 2023. Consumers in Germany could receive further relief if legislators red uce the electricity tax to the EU minimum rate and the VAT on electricity to 7 percent. E.ON has long advocated both.\n\nIdeally, these options should be exhausted before market interventions to regulate prices are considered. It is important, however, to address the causes of market uncertainties. In the case of natural gas, a reduction in supply is primarily responsible. Policymakers in Germany are responding to this situation by creating additional gas supply capacity, in particular by importing liquefied natural gas ('LNG'), and by offering commercial and residential consumers (and gas -fired power plants) incentives to conserve energy. On the electricity side, supply is constrained by limited output from nuclear power plants in France and efforts to use as little gas as possible to generate electricity. In the medium term, this can be remedied by more rapid renewables growth; in the short term, energy conservation is imperative.\n\nIn view of price developments, especially for natural gas, E.ON believes it is indispensable to swiftly provide support to particularly vulnerable customer groups. We consider direct government payments, such as the heating cost subsidy already adopted in",

E.ON therefore supports the measures enacted by German policymakers to reduce energy costs and has implemented them accordingly. For example, we endeavor that the government support payments foreseen in relief packages reach customers quickly. This include d the German federal government's payment of heating bills for December 2022 as well as to the gas and electricity price caps, which took effect on March 1, 2023, retroactively for the period beginning January 1, 2023. Governments are enacting consumer assistance programs in other countries where E.ON operates. The Netherlands, for example, introduced a price cap for electricity and gas in January 2023, while variable standard tariffs were capped in the United Kingdom by the so -called Energy Price Guarantee . In these and other E.ON regions, we focus on designing customer -specific solutions and communicating openly so that our customers can identify what makes the most sense for them. In addition, we have taken steps for E.ON itself to conserve energy. 'Specific A ctions' below contains more information.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON responded quickly to the altered situation and established a variety of task forces at Corporate Functions and at some of its regional units to deal with the energy crisis. The task forces coordinate with each other on a regular basis regarding current developments and initiatives at the units. In addition, affordability is the key topic of discussion in periodic video conferences on the energy crisis, in which the CEOs of all the regional units participate.\n\nMoreover, members of E.ON's in -house consulting team joined customer -service and communications experts from several regional units in an affordability project. It developed a set of initiatives to share best practices and thus help the E.ON Group address the high prices faced by end -customers. The regional units can implement the initiatives in a way that is tailored to their needs. The focus is on energy conservation, support for vulnerable customer groups, communications (with customers, employees, and the media), and the lobbying of policymakers.\n\nE.ON has already introduced several of the project's initiatives to support customers. For example, we have expanded the range of installment payment plans and cash payment vouchers. The latter option enables customers to pay in cash by means of QR code at places like supermarkets and gas stations. This makes it particularly easy for them to settle outstanding amounts.\n\nPeriodic reporting keeps the Management Board fully informed of current developments in the task forces; the results of the affordability project were presented in 2022.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nWe want to provide our customers with effective and reliable assistance in dealing with their challenges. Our German sales units offer individual advice through a variety of channels (telephone, online, mail) and stay in touch with our customers. The energy -saving tips we offer on our website and other channels are important as well.\n\nOur customers in Germany can turn to the payment assistance team. It supports customers facing financial difficulties by working with them to find a suitable installment payment plan. One solution, for example, foresees installment payments without interest or fees.\n\nThis team also helps customers in financial emergencies. Its services include arranging contact with job centers, telephone debt counseling, and third -party debtor portals. We also explain to them how they can conserve energy effectively, what options are available for adjusting their payments, and how they can avoid high additional payments in the next annual bill. When customers encounter payment difficulties, we have always tried to work with them to find a mutually acceptable solution. Disco nnecting should always be the last resort. There is usually a lengthy process before a disconnection is announced or actually takes place. We dialogue extensively with customers who could potentially face a disconnection to prevent it from happening.\n\nSupp ort for vulnerable customers is based on their individual needs, the market situation, and the government programs available in different countries. This support is therefore the responsibility of the\n\nregional units. For example, their advisors help customers with payment difficulties find out whether they qualify for government support programs. They also check what opportunities are available from other organizations, such as obtaining prefinancing for insulation for a customer ' s home.\n\nWe think individually tailored advice is important: individual solutions are often more effective than a blanket incentive, such as a lump sum payment for everyone. Some people may be less interested in a cash benefit than others; instead they are more likely interested in switching to renewables in the near future. For them and us, there are always good reasons to consider climate protection when making energy decisions: the transition to a climate -neutral energy supply independent of fossil fuels is essential. That is why our own short -term conservation measures are accompanied by efforts to use energy and heat at our facilities as efficient ly as possible and to deploy smart technologies to progressively optimize energy consumption. We are also gradually converting our buildings to green electricity and heat and, wherever possible, installing solar panels to power them. In addition, we are optimizing building controls, exterior lighting, and heat systems and using the flexible options of our hybrid working arrangements to red uce energy consumption. In general, we factor the characteristics of our various facilities into our conservation measures and work to ensure that we systematically comply with all applicable occupational health and safety rules.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE very kilowatt -hour counts this winter in order to reduce electricity and gas consumption. E.ON's goal is therefore to reduce the energy consumption of its own buildings by at least 20 percent on average compared with a similar period in the previous year (the heating period from October to mid -April). Across all its facilities in Germany, E.ON wants to limit the illumination of all non -essential light sources, such as logos and outdoor lighting, or to switch them off entirely. The guideline was t o reduce the room temperature to around 19 degrees Centigrade and to switch off hot water where possible. A particularly effective measure is to shut down entire",

Employees in different departments began sharing offices back in October 2022 to better utilize heated areas and leave other areas unheated. These measures apply for the entire heating period until mid -April 2022. For example, Corporate Functions in Essen aims to reduce its energy consumption by 25 percent.\n\nEven before the current developments, E.ON had set a target of making the operation of its own buildings climate -neutral by 2030. The E.ON SE Management Board reaffirmed this tar get by reiterating its support for the CEO Alliance's Sustainable Corporate Building Climate Pledge. The CEO Alliance is an international, cross -sector coalition of the CEOs of 13 major European companies; its targeted projects are intended to help shape a more sustainable and resilient Europe. The aim of the ir Building Pledge is to make the operation of their corporate buildings climate -neutral by 2030 and to encourage other companies to join in.\n\n## Diversity a nd Inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3, GRI 405\n\nSociety is diverse. So is our workforce. At E.ON, people work together who differ from each other in many ways, including nationality, generation, gender, culture, religion, physical and mental abilities, sexual orientation and identity as well as ethnic and social background. E.ON encourages and benefits from this diversity and creates an inclusive environment, because the interaction of people with different backgrounds, abilities, and personalities results in good ideas. We want to become a diversity pacesetter. We are aware that changing an organizational culture takes time, and are therefore tackling the issue step by step, committed to implement ing the necessary measures with conviction.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nDiversity is one of the dimensions of E.ON's sustainability strategy and an essential aspect of our vision and values. We want to ensure equal opportunity for all our employees. Diversity is a prerequisite for creativity and innovation, and we therefore aim to take a targeted approach to promoting it. E.ON signed the German Diversity Charter in 2008, publicly affirming its long -standing commitment to a tolerant and inclusive corporate culture. The C ompany has been an active member since 2020. In 2022 we again participated in initiatives organized by the charter, such as those in conjunction with German Diversity Day. In mid -May 2022 E.ON held its own Digital Diversity Week and made 'Allyship' the main theme. This was to draw attention to the fact that everyone can use their privileges to stand up for underr epresented groups in particular and thus become an ally. The week -long campaign included brief training sessions on allyship in German and English. We also published a video on the intranet in which our employees share their personal stories. E.ON's divers ity website went online that week as well.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe E.ON Management Board and E.ON SE Works Council signed the Diversity and Inclusion Declaration in 2016. It pledges their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment that empowers all employees to realize their individual potential. In April 2018 the E.ON Management Board, the E.ON SE Works Council, and the Group representation for severely disabled persons signed the Shared Understanding of Implementing Inclusion at E.ON, creating a n important foundation for integrating people with disabilities into the C ompany.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON believes that diversity is crucial for a successful work environment. The challenges of achieving this in practice vary by country. E.ON's approach to HR is mostly decentralized; each of our units therefore addresses diversity in its particular cultural context. This gives them the opportunity to meet challenges purposefully and to develop programs that reflect the country or region s in which they\n\noperate. Diversity is managed by Group HR/Executive HR together with a network of HR professionals that meets face -toface or virtually on a regular basis. Supported by Group HR/Executive HR, the E.ON Management Board is responsible for setting diversity targets for E.ON as a whole and its units. Some targets may reflect the laws of a particular country.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON promotes diversity and equal opportunity through a variety of programs and networks, such as a mentoring program in Germany to prepare female employees for management positions. The Women@E.ON network aims to increase the visibility and influence of women at E.ON. In addition, the LGBT+ & Friends network promotes equality, diversity, and an inclusive work environment. Also, E.ON is a member in various initiatives, such as the Initiative Women into Leadership ('IWiL') and the European Round Table ('ERT').\n\nIn March 2021 the E.ON Management Board adopted measures to achieve more diversity and inclusion in the near term at E.ON in Germany. It also recommended that the measures be implemented, to the degree feasible, at E.ON units in other countries as well. One example is the promotion of co -leadership, in which two part -time executives share a leadership position, giving them greater flexibility in balancing their professional and private lives. Another flexible option is a part -time leadership position, in which an executive works at least 80 percent, with full time as an option. In addition, recruitment policies for management positions were adjusted so that at least one candidate on the shortlist is from the underrepresented gender. Other measures include diversity training for all executives. Workshops on using inclusive language in job advertisements will also be conducted.\n\nAnother measured adopted is for E.ON Management Board members to begi n to personally sponsor a diversity network in",

' The awards pay tribute to individuals (category: Diversity Champion) and activities (category: Diversity Initiative) at E.ON that strive to make a difference in diversity and inclusion. In 2022 the CEO A ward winners were, for the first time, chosen in a Groupwide vote. Jeannyfar Gelpcke was honored in the Champion category: she supports and serves as a senior advisor to E.ON CEO Leo Birnbaum and is valued by many employees as a point of contact on various diversity issues. The 2022 CEO Award for Diversit y and Inclusion in the Initiative category went to 'Ich pack' das!' ('I can do it!'), an introductory training program run by Westnetz\n\nGmbH since 2004. The program gives young people with different backgrounds and qualifications the opportunity to enter professional life or vocational training. Individual support and assistance as well as low barriers to entry give participants new prospects. Most move on to an apprenticeship at Westnetz GmbH or are placed in an apprenticeship elsewhere.\n\nIn the first half -year of 2022, E.ON joined other companies to co -create a diversity audit for companies as part of a project initiated by the Stifterverband and the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The aim is to offer a holistic tool that helps companies permanently embed diversity and inclusion, design or refine their diversity strategy, and initiate suitable measures to implement it. Participating in the co -creation process gave E.ON the opportunity to help shape the audit's content and to share ideas with other companies on this important topic.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\n\u203a E.ON SE and E.ON companies in Germany must comply with the German Law for the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private Sector and the Public Sector, which took effect on May 1, 2015. In May 2017 the Management Board set a target quota for the proportion of women for E.ON SE regarding the composition of the first level of management below the Management Board of 30 percent and a quota of 35 percent for the second level of management below the Management Board, with an implementation deadline of June 30, 2022. Although a large number of measures were taken during the implementation period to increase the proportion of women in management positions, E.ON unfortunately has not met the targets at either level yet. As of June 30, 2022, the proportion of women in the first management level below the E.ON Management Board was 26.9 percent; in the second, 29.3 percent. In February 2022 the E.ON Management Board set new target quotas of 36 percent for the proportion of women occupying both the first and the second\n\nlevels of management below the Management Board. The targets are to be met by June 30, 2027. \u2039\n\nIn 2022 the Management Board consisted of four men and one woman. As a result, t he statutory minimum composition requirement of at least one woman and at least one man, which applied from August 1, 2022, was already met before the requirement took effect .\n\nIn 2021 E.ON set a voluntary company -wide target that goes bey ond statutory requirements. The target is to increase the proportion of women in management positions in all business units in all countries to at least 32 percent by year -end 2031. This figure corresponds to the proportion of women in E.ON's workforce at yearend 2021. Group HR monitors progress toward the target once a year and reports the findings to the E.ON Management Board. E.ON discloses the respective figures at year-end for the E.ON Group as a whole.\n\n| Share of Female Executives 1   |      |      |      |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentages                    | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n| E.ON Group                     |   23 |   21 |   21 |\n\n1 Relative to the total number of executives.\n\nE.ON aims to provide equal pay to women and men for comparable jobs at all Group companies.

The aim is to provide a fair and mutually trustful working environment to all\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees. E.ON therefore does not ask for or collect information about employees' ethnicity, marital status, and so forth. In fact, the laws of some countries prohibit doing so. Germany, however, obliges companies to collect and publish data about the number of employees with severe disabilities at their operations .\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\n| Percent                                         |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Share of women on the Supervisory  Board 1      |     30 |     30 |\n| Share of independent Supervisory Board  members |    100 |    100 |\n\n1 Refers to shareholder representatives.\n\nThe proportion of women among the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board is 30 percent, as in the previous year.

This obliges us to ensure respect for human rights in all aspects of our business, including our supply chain. E.ON therefore expects its suppliers\n\nworldwide to meet minimum standards in their environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') performance, including in relation to human rights. E.ON procures goods and services almost entirely from countries in the Organization for Economic C ooperation and Development ('OECD'). OECD members have shared guiding principles for human rights, fair work practices, environmental protection, and anti -corruption. The lack of such shared principles at companies outside the OECD may increase the risk of practices or incidents that harm people and the environment. Business with such companies accounts for less than 6.5 percent of E.ON's purchase volume. E.ON assesses its suppliers' ESG performance prior to doing business with them and subject suppliers in higher -risk countries or categories to greater scrutiny. In addition, E.ON strives to compl y with the legal requirements for transparency along its supply chain, which in many countries are becoming increasingly more demanding.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON takes its responsibilities seriously and is therefore committed to doing business in a compliant way, respecting human rights, protecting the environment, and ensuring proper work conditions. E.ON expects that its suppliers are likewise to high ESG standards and have processes in place to ensure that they do. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders and participating in industry initiatives help E.ON to pay particular attention to human rights issues. For example, E.ON is a member of econsense, a network of Germany -based multinational companies dedicated to promoting sustainable business development and respect for human rights. E.ON also participates in a working group at the German Compliance Institute DICO focusing on the same objectives.\n\nE.ON launched a Group -wide human rights due diligence project in the summer of 2022 to prepare the Company for the requirements of Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. The project was led by the Group's Sustainability department. All other affected departments -such as Supply Chain, Human Resources ('HR'), Compliance, and Health, Safety, and Environment ('HSE') -are closely involved. As part of the project, E.ON developed a Group-",

More information can be found below under 'Organization and Responsibilities.'\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nTo prevent human rights violations, E.ON aims to always adhere to external standards and for this purpose has its own policies and guidelines. E.ON's Code of Conduct (more information can be found in the Compliance and Anti -corruption chapter) obliges all employees to contribute to a non -discriminatory and safe work environment and to respect human rights. E.ON's Human Rights Policy Statement was signed by all Management Board members and published on the E.ON website. The statement acknowledges the International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation ('ILO') of the United Nations ('UN') and its fundamental conventions. It also refers to E.ON's own guidelines, such as the Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, a People Guideline provides guidance to employees so that they procure goods and services in line with E.ON's ESG standards. The rules and regulations E.ON follows also include the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact ('UNGC'). E.ON has been a participant in the UNGC since 2005.\n\nThe E.ON Supply Chain Function Policy describes the mandate and organizational setup of the Supply Chain function. The function encompasses the management of procurement processes, activities, policies, tools, and supplier relationships for all units to which the policy applies. In addition, the Function Policy (in conjunction with the Supply Chain Handbook) defines Groupwide principles, processes, and responsibilities for non -fuel pro curement by the above -mentioned units. Excluded from this are the special cases on a specific list (for example energy and fuel procurement, financial and real estate transactions, insurance, and taxes).\n\nThe standards for human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and compliant business practices that E.ON require its suppliers to meet are defined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, which was updated in 2020. It applies to all suppliers. The updated version contains a more detailed description of requirements for corporate social responsibility ('CSR'), including information about how to contact E.ON's whistle -blower hotline. E.ON's supplier on -boarding process includes self -registration, a formal agreement to adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct, and a compliance check. Non -fuel suppliers that are not subject to supplier onboarding must agree to E.ON's General Terms and Conditions for Purchase Contracts, which are legally binding. These oblige non -fuel suppliers, among other things, to comply with the minimum standards of our Supplier Code of Conduct .\n\n\u203a In addition, E.ON has issued a Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement annually since 2017. It describes the steps E.ON takes to prevent and combat human rights violations along its supply chai n. E.ON publishes it annually on the Sustainability Channel of E.ON's corporate website and on its UK website. \u2039\n\nE.ON is committed to procuring the fuel for its biomass -fired assets responsibly and sustainably. Suppliers of solid biomass must, like non -fuel suppliers, contractually agree to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Until March 2023, the E.ON Biomass Purchasing Amendment from 2010 defined our policies and procedures, which include risk assessments, supplier audits, and provisions for joint ventures. Effective March 2023, we redefined the terms for the purchase of solid biomass for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business and thus replaced the former Biomass Purchasing Amendment. The purpose of the new rules is to ensure that all units act in accordance with applicable EU regulations and meet E.ON's sustainability standards when procuring and using solid biomass for their business activities. All biomass suppliers must pledge to respect human rights, safeguard the general living conditions of persons affected by biomass production, and protect biodiversity and the environment.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe role of Chief Human Rights Officer was previously held by the Chairman of the E.ON Management Board, Leonhard Birnbaum, who continues to serve as Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairman of the Sustainability Council. As part of the Group -wide human rights due diligence project, the task areas of the future Chief Human Rights Officer were expanded in line with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, with greater focus being placed on legal aspects. In order to meet the associated new requirements, in January 2023 E.ON transferred the role to the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer . The new Chief Human Rights Officer is also a permanent member of the Sustainability Council. The Group -wide human rights due diligence project, which is led by the Group Sustainability department, will continue. Staff in the Sustainability and Legal Affairs & Compliance divisions deal with human rights issues, such as changes in legislation.\n\nAll employees of Group units are responsible for ensuring that requirements are met at our own company. The Supply Chain division, on the other hand, deals with the full range of ESG aspects along the supply chain. It carries out the related tasks in observance of legal requirements as well as company policies, including HSE and sustainability standards.\n\n## Spe cific Actions\n\nE.ON's Covid -19 Supply Chain Task Force, which was established in 2020, has developed a variety of processes for addressing supply risks. Due to the Russia -Ukraine war, additional measures, such as a sanctions list check by external service providers, were introduced to ensure a reliable supply chain.\n\nE.ON has used a digital solution since year -end 2018 to check whether new suppliers meet its minimum requirements. This helps mitigate potential HSE and CSR risks. Every non -fuel supplier whose individual transaction volume exceeds \u20ac25,000 or whose HSE risk is medium or high must complete an online onboarding process. As of year -end 2022, the suppliers involved in 98.3",

New suppliers are asked by the manager responsible for their product or service category to register using the supplier onboarding solution. Depending on the transaction volume and HSE risk, suppliers must complete one or more questionnaires. In certain cases, E.ON may take additional steps. These include a supplier audit to check whether the supplier complies with E.ON's standards for human rights, working conditions, and environmental protection. E.ON may also require a supplier to have in place an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or Ec oManagement and Audit Scheme ('EMAS') III or ISO 45001. Suppliers that participate in tenders as part of a public procurement act do not use the above -described process but instead follow the qualification procedures required under their country's laws.\n\nBuilding on the assessment procedures introduced in 2018, in the year under review E.ON continued to evaluate its suppliers' performance and, based on the findings, make decisions about its relationship with them. In addition, E.ON determines annually which of its non -fuel suppliers it deems important; for this purpose, E.ON evaluates them on the basis of five KPIs: quality, commercial aspects, delivery, innovation, and corporate sustainability, including human rights. E.ON discusses the results with its suppliers in feedback meetings. During this meeting, E.ON also decides whether E.ON will require a supplier to take specific improvement measures if the business relationship is to be maintained. Due to the crisis situation, E.ON held many additional discussions with suppliers that were not considered discussions of their performance.\n\nThe human rights due diligence check 4 introduced in 2021 is based on a human rights risk matrix that E.ON developed together with outside experts. The risks of the different categories of goods and services E.ON procures are plotted on one axis; the risks of the countries in which suppliers operate are plotted on the\n\nother. The risks of individual countries are based on the results of several human rights studies, such as the Global Rights Index of the International Trade Union Confederation ('ITUC') and the Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme ('UNDP'). Potentially risky suppliers first had to pass additional checks, such as a more detailed questionnaire or audit, and agree to make improvements and provide evidence of their implementation. In 2022 more than 2,500 new and existing suppliers answered the questionnaire. Many high -risk suppliers successfully completed the human rights due diligence check. Nevertheless, E.ON is aware that the complexity of international supply chains poses a challenge to transparency. E.ON is therefore also active in industry initiatives to develop industry -specific standards for improved transparency in supply chains. Examples can be found in the chapter entitled ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement .\n\nA sustainability roadmap developed by the Supply Chain department in 2021 with short -, medium - and longterm goals is aligned with E.ON's ESG targets. It consists of four elements: environment, diversity, occupational health and safety, and governance. In 2022 E.ON also developed two key content items whose implementation has already been initiated; they are described below.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022 E.ON began introducing a digital solution for ongoing risk assessment of suppliers with medium and high human rights risk. They are assessed in a variety of categories, including sustainability, finance, cybersecurity, supply chain disruption, and compliance. The program specifically gathers and evaluates information on risks relevant to Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. It looks at several elements called points of interest ('PoIs'): the holding company of suppliers, branches, plant locations, and logistics routes. Since the program's introduction, over 2,500 PoIs have been monitored on an ongoing basis, thereby covering 60 percent of E.ON's annual spend.\n\nA first step toward decarbonizing supply chains is to make the current CO2 emissions of purchased goods and services more transparent. E.ON therefore conducted a heatmap analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chains. E.ON used third -party emissions factors and cost -based data to create a CO 2 heatmap that gives it a more accurate overview of the climate footprint of its product and service categories. The Company intends to build on this in 2023 and derive additional measures for more transparency. More information on our reduction efforts can be found in the Climate Protection chapter.\n\nVarious regulatory requirements currently oblige companies to integrate their human rights due diligence into their business and supply chain. Examples include Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which came into force on January 1, 2023, as well as the EU taxonomy and the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'). The latter will apply for the first time to reporting for the 202 4 financial year. E.ON prepared for these requirements by launching a Group -wide human r ights due d iligence project in the summer of 2022. The Sustainability Department is responsible for the project; it works closely with Legal, Supply Chain, Group Accounting, HSE, and HR, and is supported by outside experts. In addition, the Sustainability Council serves as a steering committee. Since the summer of 2022, E.ON has examined the status quo of existing processes and measures, identified gaps, and developed optimization measures. A concept for conducting a risk analysis was adopted and will be implemented at E.ON's operations in 2023. E.ON identified the potential for minor improvements in matters relating to its supply chain, such as in the Supplier Code of Conduct and its approach to supplier risk management, which will likewise be updated in 2023.\n\nE.ON continually improves its eLearning tools for employees, such as the annual web training module on human rights, compliance, and cyber and data security, which was updated in September",

Around 81 percent of employees had completed the module by the end of 2022.\n\nIn addition, E.ON trained about 560 Supply Chain employees on respecting human rights along the supply chain and on E.ON's risk matrix for human rights. After this training, E.ON answered questions about the use of the matrix in meetings held at regular intervals.\n\nE.ON also made intranet -based training videos available to employees. The videos highlight the tangible positive impacts of a more sustainable supply chain and corresponding individual purchasing decisions. In addition, E.ON held three information events called Lunch & Learn, which focused on the environment, diversity, and occupational health and safety. Furthermore, six HSE events were held with suppliers in 2022, in part online due to the pandemic.\n\nA large proportion of our biomass capacity is installed in Sweden. E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB operates district heating businesses in \u00d6rebro, N\u00f6rrk\u00f6ping, and parts of Stockholm and Malm\u00f6. Since 2014, E.ON has assessed the CSR performance of its suppliers there using a method developed by E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB. In addition, key requirements for biomass suppliers -such as the Supplier Code of Conduct and compliance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (\"RED II\") -have been integral to contracts with suppliers since 2021. In 2022 E.ON introduced an expanded in -house assessment of sustainability -related risks.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON's objective is to avoid violations of human rights, environmental standards, and its corporate principles. For this purpose, E.ON endeavors to identify the relevant risks along its value chain. Periodic risk assessments can help E.O N detect actual or suspected violations. If violations occur, the Supply Chain Compliance Officer and the respective Supply Chain Director are notified immediately and corrective measures are demanded from the supplier. Implementation is precisely\n\nmonitored by E.ON. If the situation does not improve, E.ON terminates its business dealings with the supplier. No business dealings were terminated in 2022.\n\nEmployees can report possible violations of human rights through internal reporting channels and a Group -wide, IT -supported external whistle -blower hotline. The hotline service, which is published on the internet, can take calls in the official languages of all countries in which E.ON operates. Not only E.ON employees, but also business partners, their employees, and other third parties can contact the hotline, anonymously if they wish. The information is forwarded to the responsible department at Corporate Functions. Depending on the type and severity of the potential violation, Compliance immediately reports i t to the E.ON Management Board, files criminal charges, initiates its own investigation, or takes other measures. In 2022 the whistle -blower hotline was used to report four potential human rights violations . The investigation found that the allegations wer e not a violation of human rights or E.ON's Code of Conduct.\n\n## NonCore Business: Uranium Procurement\n\nE.ON subsidiary PreussenElektra will continue to operate Isar 2 nuclear power plant until April 15, 2023, owing to political decisions made in the year under review, after which the plant will stop producing electricity. No additional fuel had to be procured for this. PreussenElektra stopped procuring uranium in 2020.",

This also includes having a transparent tax strategy. E.ON's tax strategy and corporate strategy are closely aligned. The aim is to manage the Company's taxes sustainably in order to help ensure that it continue to invest, to operate flexibly and efficiently, and to provide attractive dividends to shareholders. E.ON's tax strategy is therefore designed to be fully compliant with tax law. It ensures that management of E.ON's taxation is efficient, responsible, transparent, and accurate, both for the Group as a whole and in individual tax jurisdictions.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is aware that taxes, which fund public services, are important for governments and authorities. E.ON thus optimizes its overall tax position prudently. It aims for full tax compliance and supports all national and international tax legislation and standards. E.ON also has in place policies and procedures to prevent tax evasion. This includes the obligation of all employees to report any suspicions or concerns to their supervisor, Group Tax, their unit's Tax function, Group Compliance, or the whistle-blower hotline; if they wish, they may do so anonymously (for more information about the hotline, see the Compliance and Anti-corruption chapter).\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's tax function encompasses Group Tax as well as the units' Tax departments. It actively and continually identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages tax risks to make sure that the Company's tax practices are in line with its strategic objectives. To achieve this and to ensure appropriate responses to risks, E.ON has in place a governance framework, which includes a Tax Function Policy. The framework and policy were approved by the E.ON Management Board and are mandatory for all Group companies. They are\n\nembedded into E.ON's overall compliance management system and supplemented by substantial risk control management procedures, continual self-assessment as well as regular internal and external audits. The tax function has also published the aforementioned tax strategy.\n\nE.ON has issued a binding Group-wide Transfer Pricing Policy to ensure that intra-Group transactions are conducted in accordance with the arm's-length principle. This principle of international tax law states that the transfer prices of cross-border transactions between Group units, including all ownership interests above 25 percent, must be set as they would be in a comparable transaction between independent third parties in an external market. Group Tax is responsible for monitoring adherence to the arm's-length principle and is involved in all major intra-Group transactions. It does this through various means, including regular meetings with relevant E.ON business units and functions as well as fixed Groupwide transfer pricing processes. In addition, participants from relevant business units and functions (in Germany and elsewhere) meet at least once a year to align cross-border intra-Group transactions to meet operational as well as tax requirements. Transfer pricing processes are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe E.ON Management Board has overall responsibility for the Group's corporate strategy, which includes managing and monitoring the tax function. It has delegated the responsibility for this function to the Senior Vice President ('SVP') Group Tax, who reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The heads of the Tax departments in Germany and other countries report directly to Group Tax as well as to their unit's management board. Furthermore, E.ON SE has appointed a Tax Compliance Officer ('TCO'), whose role is to ensure that the existing tax compliance management system is effective and efficient. The TCO reports directly to the SVP Group Tax. Additionally, local tax compliance management systems were put in place at the subsidiary level.\n\nThe SVP Group Tax defines E.ON's tax principles and is responsible for ensuring that these principles and concomitant procedures are in place, maintained, and complied with Group-wide. He reports to the E.ON Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee on taxrelated issues and risks. In addition, financial tax risks are reported to Group Controlling and Risk, which examines these risks from a Group perspective and prepares reports for the consolidated risk assessment of the E.ON Group. The tax function disseminates guidelines and policies to ensure tax compliance, including related tasks, processes, and responsibilities. E.ON has in place tax compliance management systems according to IDW audit standard PS 980 at its major operations in Germany. The systems' purpose is to identify and classify all material tax risks and to map the findings in a detailed risk control matrix ('RCM'). The RCMs are continually updated and maintained.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON's tax function takes a variety of steps to stay on top of new developments. Teams and managers hold meetings at various intervals (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to discuss emerging tax issues. E.ON's tax experts also meet at slightly longer intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to discuss country-specific and international tax issues. These meetings, which take place both physically and virtually, promote continuous collaboration and coordination between Group Tax and the units' Tax departments. In addition, Tax teams and managers also receive in-house training. E.ON strives to continually improve processes, particularly by deploying and using digital solutions that ensure tax compliance while enhancing efficiency. Our digital solutions include an integrated toolset that calculates income tax for quarterly and annual financial statements and tax returns. Tax tools are updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in tax laws. This enables us to ensure that our calculations always comply with the law and that we can make them more simply, efficiently, and reliably. Where reasonable, we implement software interfaces to ensure data integrity and to minimize the risk of manual errors.",

This enables them contribute to the discussion on new tax legislation as well (for more information on E.ON's work in associations, see the ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement chapter).\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON and its tax function place great emphasis on maintaining transparent and mutual communications with the tax authorities in the countries where the Company does business. As a good corporate citizen we prepare and file all required tax returns and pay the correct amount of tax on time. When necessary, we seek advice from independent experts to clarify uncertainties.\n\nTo achieve a higher level of certainty, E.ON regularly discusses binding tax rulings or advance pricing agreements ('APA') with tax authorities if this is possible, convenient, and of general or economic importance to E.ON. This enables us to prevent subsequent disagreements between the tax authorities of different states and our business units.\n\nE.ON partners with external tax experts that help it supervise company audits and prepare tax returns and declarations as well as tax payments. The collaboration with external partners is based on open, mutually trustful communications. Each partner performs its own independent quality assurance, which, in the aggregate, leads to adequate quality checks. E.ON constantly aims for certainty in its tax positions and, where appropriate, obtains internal or external advice to verify and validate its positions. In case our assessment does not match that of the tax authorities, we communicate the divergent opinion openly in order to prevent misunderstandings.",

Sustainable energy is not essential for propelling economic and social development, but a key factor in tackling climate change. Meeting the global challenges of climate change will require that the financial system changes so that it promotes sustainable businesses and climate -friendly solutions. E.ON's ambitious climate targets set it on an emissions -reduction path that is systematically aligned with the new energy world. Sustainability is at the core of our corporate strategy and is also the guiding principle for our actions. Our strategy accords with the European Union's decarbonization agenda and the EU Green Deal. Energy networks -one of E.ON's core businesses -are the backbone of Europe's energy transition. Our investment program therefore aims to be largely aligned with the EU taxonomy. More than half of these investments will be financed by the issuance of green bonds. Our strategy thus also reflects capital markets' increasing interest in sustainable investments. \u2039\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Principles\n\nThe European Commission's action plan on financing sustainable growth defined a series of measures to channel capital toward environmentally sustainable activities and thus to help enable the European Union to become climate -neutral by 2050 as foreseen by the European Green Deal. The Commission laid the foundation for this in Regulation 2020/852, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which describes what is considered an 'environmentally sustainable activity' and which criteria are used to classify an economic activity as environmentally sustainable. The aim is to classify economic activities EU -wide on the basis of defined requirements with regard to their contribution to the six defined environmental objectives (Article 9 of the EU taxonomy) and thus to support the European Union's transformation to a climate and environmentally friendly economy. The six objectives are:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nArticle 3 of the EU taxonomy defines economic activities as environmentally sustainable if they:\n\n- \u00b7 contribute substantially to at least one of six environmental objectives (Articles 10 to 16)\n- \u00b7 do no significant harm to any of the other five environmental objectives (Article 17)\n- \u00b7 comply with minimum standards for occupational safety, human rights, anti -corruption, fair competition, and taxation (Article 18)\n- \u00b7 comply with technical screening criteria defined by the European Commission.\n\nFor the 2022 financial year, as for 2021, only the first two environmental objectives are to be considered for the question of a substantial contribution. Sets of criteria are available for defining the substantial contribution toward achieving the objectives.\n\nKnown as technical screening criteria ('TSC'), they specify which economic activities are considered taxonomy -aligned. The other environmental objectives (three to six) will probably have to be reported from the 2023 financial year onward.\n\nAn economic activity makes a substantial contribution to environmental objective 1, 'climate change mitigation,' if it contributes substantially to the stabilization of greenhouse -gas ('GHG') concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents\n\ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, consistent with the Paris Agreement's long -term temperature target through the avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions.\n\nEconomic activities that contribute to environmental objective 2, 'climate change adaptation,' include or provide solutions that either avoid or substantially reduce the risk of the adverse impacts of the current and the future climate on the economic activity itself or on people, nature, or assets.\n\nE.ON has been required beginning with the 2021 financial year to disclose the proportion of investments, revenues, and operating expenses that were attributable to taxonomy -eligible and taxonomy -noneligible economic activities. Activities are taxonomy -eli gible if they are described in principle in Annexes I and II to the Delegated Act on environmental objectives and can be assigned, regardless of whether or not the corresponding TSC for environmentally sustainable activities are met.\n\nIn addition to the information required by law, E.ON voluntarily disclosed its taxonomy -aligned investments, revenues, and operating expenditures for the 2021 financial year. Activities are taxonomy -aligned if the corresponding taxonomy -eligible activities also meet all the criteria in Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy. This information is mandatory effective 2022.\n\nThe European Commission has defined taxonomy criteria for various economic activities under which conditions these activities make a substantial contribution to climate protection and, at the same time, do not significantly harm the achievement of the EU's five other environmental objectives. However, the criteria's provisions, formulations, and terms are still subject to uncertainties of interpretation. The following presents our interpretation of the sets of criteria.\n\nThe figures for taxonomy -relevant economic activities were determined with reference to the FAQ documents published by the",

If the criteria provide for simplifications that allow compliance with the criteria to be assessed at the level of the entire economic activity, an operating segment, or for the entire Group, E.ON makes use of them .\n\n## Assessment of Doing No Significant Harm ('DNSH')\n\nThe DNSH criteria mainly refer to compliance with legal requirements or, in the case of the 'circular economy' objective, to fundamental aspects of the economic activity. DNSH conformity is therefore to be assessed at the level of an economic activity on a regular basis. DNSH conformity regarding EU environmental objective 2, 'climate change adaptation,' is identified and assessed in E.ON's established risk management process. For this purpose, E.ON makes use of existing systems and processes for financial and nonfinancial risk management, which it has expanded to include EU taxonomy matters. Details can be found in the Risks and Chances Report .\n\n## Assessments of Minimum Safeguards\n\nE.ON uses established processes and documentation at the Group level to assess and comply with the minimum safeguards. The Group ensures that the EU taxonomy's requirements are fully met in this regard by means of appropriate guidelines and related training and monitoring measures. E.ON companies are required to implement such policies and guidelines in a binding manner.\n\nResponsibility for compliance lies with the respective companies.\n\n## Taxonomy -Aligned Economic Activities\n\nThe assessment included a review of all activities relevant for E.ON to determine whether they make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and meet the criteria contained in Article 3 of the EU taxonomy.

No other criteria for the assessment of their substantial contribution to climate protection need to be assessed. The same applies to the installation of devices such as solar panels, smart energy meters, and electric -vehicle charging stations in buildings.\n\nE.ON's activities to establish infrastructure for personal eMobility meet the required criteria for creating low -carbon road transpor t.\n\nE.ON's electricity networks make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation within the meaning of the taxonomy, since they are downstream distribution networks and thus part of the European interconnected system.\n\nE.ON operates a large number of heating networks. This activity is in principle taxonomy -eligible. Some of these heating networks are 'efficient' within the meaning of the taxonomy's criteria. This means that they transmit at least 50 percent renewable heat, at least 50 percent waste heat, at least 75 percent CHP heat, or at least 50 percent of a combination of these energy sources. Such heating networks thus make a substantial contribution to climate protection.\n\nIn addition, E.ON operates water supply systems, the majority of which make a substantial contribution to climate change",

For water supply systems that do not meet these criteria, investments made in the financial year to improve their energy efficiency and/or leakage rate by at least 20 percent are classified as taxonomy -aligned investments. These water supply systems revenues are classified as taxonomy -aligned if the investments enabled them to meet the aforementioned criteria for taxonomy -aligned water supply systems.\n\nIn the case of gas networks, in particular investments in existing infrastructure that increase the possibility of blending hydrogen and other low -carbon gases were classified as taxonomy -aligned. Pilot projects to establish dedicated hydrogen infrastructure were as well. So too were investments and operating expenses related to the detection and/or prevention of methane leaks.\n\nE.ON operates a large number of CHP and heat generation plants. Depending on the energy source used, there are various sets of criteria, some of which are met by E.ON plants. Plants fueled solely by natural gas will be classified as taxonomy -eligible under the new sets of criteria but are not classified as taxonomy -aligned at present.\n\nInvestments in the development of broadband data infrastructure are classified as taxonomy -aligned because the data and analyses provided by them lead directly to the reduction of GHG emissions at E.ON or its customers .\n\n## Do No Significant Harm\n\nProtecting assets against the physical impacts of climate change ('climate change adaptation') is economically relevant for E.ON and is therefore factored into investment decisions. Climate -related risks and opportunities are also recorded in E.ON's risk management system. The Risks and Chances Report contains more information.\n\nThe criteria for the EU's environmental objective 3, 'the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,' mainly refer to legal and regulatory requirements in the energy sector. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite for obtain ing construction and operating permits. The same applies in principle to the criteria for the EU's environmental objective 5, 'pollution prevention and control.' Details can be found in the Environmental Manageme nt chapter.\n\nThere are general criteria for the environmental objective 4, 'the transition to a circular economy,' such as long durability, easy disassembly, or reparability. Most components are designed for a very long lifespan, are recyclable, and still have economic value at the end of their useful life (such as steel, aluminum, and copper). Such components of assets can be recycled within the E.ON Group or sold to third parties for further use.\n\nWith regard to the EU's environmental objective 6, 'the pro tection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems,' E.ON, where required, conducts environmental impact assessments and comparable assessments, which are a key prerequisite for obtaining permits to build and operate asset. Furthermore, one of E.ON's important ambitions is to conduct ecological corridor management or to convert to this approach.\n\n## Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards\n\nE.ON is committed to respecting human rights in all business processes. To prevent human rights violations, E.ON adheres to external standards and defines its own principles and policies. E.ON's Human Rights Policy Statement explicitly acknowledges the United Nations' International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organi zation's Declaration on Fundamental P rinciples and Rights at Work and the latter's fundamental conventions. The statement also makes reference to E.ON's own policies, such as the Supplier Code of Conduct and the Code of Conduct for employees. The standards for human rights, work conditions, environmental protection, and compliant business practices that E.ON requires its suppliers to meet are defined in the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nConducting a periodic risk assessment serves to indicate potential threats. E.ON promotes compliance with its standards and minimize potential threats by means of numerous measures and processes. The principle focus of these activities at E.ON's own business is on occupational safety and fair work conditions. Additional information about the assurance of a responsible supply chain, compliance and anti -corruption, and tax is contained in the chapters on these topics.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Key Figures\n\nE.ON's reporting applies the indicators defined in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation : taxonomy -eligible and taxonomy -aligned investments, revenues, and operating expenses. All business operations identified at E.ON are assigned to precisely one of the EU taxonomy's economic activities in order to prevent double counting.",

Taxonomy -eligible activities as a ratio of the total amount shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements prepared according to IFRS\n- 2. Taxonomy -aligned activities as a ratio of the total amount shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements prepared according to IFRS\n- 3. Taxonomy -aligned activities as a ratio of taxonomy -eligible activities\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments were calculated on a gross basis; that is, without taking into account revaluations or depreciation and amortization or impairment charges. They consist of investments in non -current tangible and intangib le assets (fixed assets), including assets acquired in asset deals (recorded directly) and share deals (investment amount determined by the purchase -price allocation). More specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 Property, plant, and equipment pursuant to IAS 16.73 (e) (i) and (iii)\n- \u00b7 Intangible assets pursuant to IAS 38.118 (e) (i)\n- \u00b7 Investment property pursuant to IAS 40.76 (a) and (b), IAS 40.79 (d) (i) and (ii)\n- \u00b7 Agriculture pursuant to IAS 41.50 (b) and (e)\n- \u00b7 Leasing pursuant to IFRS 16.53 (h).\n\nGroup investments consist of additions to fixed assets plus additions to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets from business combinations, which are shown in Note 15.\n\nOf E.ON's taxonomy -eligible investments, property, plant, and equipment accounted for \u20ac3,910 million, intangible assets for \u20ac292 million, and right -of -use assets for \u20ac262 million . \u20ac3,850 million of property, plant, and equipment, \u20ac273 million of intangible assets, and \u20ac262 million of right -of -use assets are taxonomy -aligned.\n\nIn accordance with the taxonomy's specifications, E.ON also includes non -cash -effective investments, but not additions to financial assets. The taxonomy's definition of investments differs from E.ON's performance indicator for investments, namely cash -effective investments. E.ON therefore reconciles total investments pursuant to the taxonomy to the investments disclosed in the 'Financial Situation' section of the Business Report:\n\n## Reconciliation to Cash-effective Investments\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                 | Q1-Q4 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| EU taxonomy: total investments (excluding Non-Core  Business) | 5,477        |\n| ./.

An investment plan according to category b) or investments according to category c) do not exist at E.ON.\n\n## Revenues\n\nRevenues correspond to net sales excluding electricity and energy taxes as shown in the Consolidated Income Statements of the Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe denominator for operating expenses is to be specified in accordance with the taxonomy requirements. Ecol ogically sustainable operating expenses are to include individually attributable, non -capitalized expenses for research and development, building renovations, short -term leasing, maintenance and repairs, other direct expenses in connection with the maintenance of assets, and other expenses necessary for the maintenance of ecologically sustainable economic activities. At E.ON, this mainly includes expenditures for repair and maintenance performed by third parties, which are reported under cost of materials and other operating expenses.",

Due to the discontinuation of power operations at PreussenElektra's Isar 2 nuclear power plant, it had hardly any investments in 2022. Taxonomy -aligned activities accounted for 98 percent of taxonomy -eligible investments.\n\nThe Energy Networks segment made a significant contribution. About 91 percent of its investments were taxonomy -eligible; nearly all of them were taxonomy -aligned. At roughly \u20ac3.4 billion , the largest contribution came from E.ON's electricity distribution networks, which are part of the European interconnected system. They continually integrate renewable generating facilities, thereby propelling the energy transition in Europe and connecting customers to sustainable energy. E.ON invested significantly more in taxonomy -aligned electricity networks compared with the previous year. This trend is supported by the digitalization of E.ON's networks through the expansion of fiber -optics and broad -band technology. E.ON invested \u20ac294 million in this area in the year under review.\n\nIn addi tion, \u20ac312 million of investments in gas networks were taxonomy -aligned. This figure is slightly lower than in the prior year. In Germany in particular, these investments serve to establish and expand hydrogen infrastructure or enable hydrogen to be admixed to E.ON's existing gas networks. \u20ac69 million of the investments in our water networks were taxonomy -aligned.\n\nThe Customer Solutions segment's energy infrastructure business ( \u20ac0.3 billion of taxonomy -aligned investments) was its main contributor to the EU taxonomy. The expansion of its assets for district heating distribution and for biofuel -fired electricity and heat cogeneration as well as investments in plants for heat production with combined feedstocks are covered by the taxonomy. The eMobility charging infrastructure business, the installation, maintenance, and repair of renewables technologies and of devices for controlling buildings' overall energy efficiency\n\nare likewise taxonomy -aligned. The procurement and sale of power and gas are not covered by the taxonomy. E.ON's distributed solar generating facilities contributed additional amounts. We invested in solar projects in 2022 , for example in Germany and Croatia.\n\nInvestments reported at Corporate Functions/Other did not fall within the EU taxonomy's scope.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Investments 1\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | Taxonomy - eligible Investments   | Taxonomy - eligible Investments   | Taxonomy - eligible Investments   |                           |       | EU taxonomy ratios -  -         | EU taxonomy ratios -  -        | EU taxonomy ratios -  -              |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Q1-Q4 2022                | Taxo -  nomy -  aligned           | Not  taxonomy -  aligned          | Total                             | Not  taxonomy -  eligible | Total | % Taxonomy eligible  (of total) | % Taxonomy aligned  (of total) | % Taxonomy -  aligned  (of eligible) |\n| Energy Networks           | 4,074                             | 46                                | 4,120                             | 398                       | 4,518 | 91                              | 90                             | 99                                   |\n| Customer Solutions        | 310                               | 35                                | 345                               | 542                       | 887   | 39                              | 35                             | 90                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 | 65                        | 65    | -                               | -                              | -                                    |\n| Core Business             | 4,384                             | 81                                | 4,465                             | 1,005                     | 5,470 | 82                              | 80                             | 98                                   |\n| Non- Core Business        | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 | 7                         | 7     | -                               | -                              | -                                    |\n| E.ON Group                | 4,384                             | 81                                | 4,465                             | 1,012                     | 5,477 | 82                              | 80                             | 98                                   |\n| Q1-Q4 2021                |                                   |                                   |                                   |                           |       |                                 |                                |                                      |\n| Energy Networks           | 3,467                             | 33                                | 3,500                             | 447                       | 3,947 | 89                              | 88                             | 99                                   |\n| Customer Solutions        | 251                               | 80                                | 331                               | 426                       | 757   | 44                              | 33                             | 76                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | 9                                 | -                                 | 9                                 | 98                        | 107   | 9                               | 9                              | 100                                  |\n| Core Business             | 3,727                             | 113                               | 3,840                             | 971                       | 4,811 | 80                              | 77                             | 97                                   |\n| Non- Core Business        | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 | 432                       | 432   | -                               | -                              | -                                    |\n| E.ON Group                | 3,727                             | 113                               | 3,840                             | 1,403                     | 5,243 | 73                              | 71                             | 97                                   |\n\n1 Based on EU taxonomy regulations (includes non -cash items, excludes financial investments).",

This corresponds to around 97 percent of taxonomy -eligible expenses.\n\nAs with investments, the majority of aligned expenses resulted from maintenance activities for E.ON ' s electricity network ( \u20ac797 million). Smaller amounts related to gas distribution networks, particularly to prevent or reduce methane leaks ( \u20ac19 million).\n\nThe business with decentralized electricity and/or heat/cooling generation plants accounted for around \u20ac22 million. \u20ac57 million was related to the installation and maintenance of renewable technologies at the Customer Solutions segment, particularly in its sales business in the United Kingdom.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Operating Expenses\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | Taxonomy -

However, revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to end -customers are not covered by the EU taxonomy. As expected, therefore, only 13 percent of external sales were taxonomy -eligible.\n\nNearly all taxonomy -eligible revenues were also taxonomy -aligned , of which the vast majority -\u20ac13.7 billion-related to electricity transmission fees in E.ON ' s distribution networks. E.ON reports \u20ac10.0 billion as external revenues in the Energy Networks segment and \u20ac3.7 billion in the Customer Solutions segment from sales revenues for network charges insofar as these were attributable to E.ON's own distribution network territory.\n\nE.ON generated additional aligned revenues of around \u20ac0.7 billion relating to the energy efficiency of buildings and renewable energy technologies, such as the installation, maintenance, and repair of photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and solar -powered systems for water heating .\n\nOur energy infrastructure business, which generates decentralized electricity and/or heat/cooling from a variety of sources, generated around \u20ac0.2 billion in aligned revenues.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Revenues\n\n| \u20ac in  millions            | Taxonomy -

Sustainability aspects play an increasingly important role in many international investors' decision for or against a particular investment. Accordingly, since 2019 E.ON has also systematically considered sustainability in the structuring of its financing as well, both in debt and credit markets.\n\nIn 2019 E.ON presented its first Green Bond Framework under which it issues green bonds. E.ON issued its first green bonds that same year. In 2021 E.ON then became the first company to fully align its revised Green Bond Framework not only with the ICMA Green Bond Principles -the current market standard for green bonds -but also with the EU Taxonomy. The taxonomy defines which economic activities are classified as environmental ly sustainable, thereby setting a Europe -wide standard for sustainable investment. E.ON had \u20ac7.65 billion of green bonds outstanding at year -end 2022, making it Germany's largest issuer of green bonds. The green bonds issued in the year under review accoun ted for \u20ac2.3 billion of this amount. E.ON raised bond financing of \u20ac1.8 billion in January 2023, of which a \u20ac1 billion tranche is structured as a green bond. Going forward, E.ON intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual financing requirements with green bonds.\n\nE.ON's Green Bond Framework focuses on sustainable projects in the categories Electricity Networks, Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Clean Transportation, both in E.ON's electricity network and customer solutions businesses. E.ON's G reen Bond Portfolio, a portfolio of qualifying assets in line with the Green Bond Framework, consisted of assets worth \u20ac 22.4 billion at yearend 2022. E.ON's power networks in Germany and Sweden account for the largest share.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside its focus on green bonds, E.ON's corporate financing includes a sustainability -based \u20ac3.5 billion syndicated credit facility that was concluded in 2019. After two options to extend the facility were exercised, its term ends in October 2026. The facility's credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings. This gives us additional financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as a reliable and sustainable liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be drawn on as needed .",

In addition, our regional and national sustainability activities regularly receive awards. In the new compensation system for Management Board members, ESG ratings are a component of the E.ON Sustainability Index and represent a performance criterion that is taken into account in the Management Board's long-te rm variable compensation. In the ESG ratings that are important to us, E.ON has received predominantly good score for years. The Sustainability Channel at eon.com presents the most relevant and current results. The next section takes a closer look at four ratings that are relevant for E.ON .\n\n## CDP Climate Change\n\nCDP once again placed E.ON on its A List for environmental reporting. The rating is in the Leadership Level, placing E.ON among the top 2 96 companies out of nearly 15,000 assessed to make the A List in 2022 .\n\n## ISS ESG\n\nInternational Shareholder Services ('ISS') gave E.ON a C+ rating. The letter ratings range from D -to A+. Companies at or above a threshold of B -are among the leaders in their industry. In addition, E.ON's decile rank is 2. The decile rank indicates in which decile of its industry (tenth of the total number) a company's rating falls. The ranks go from 1 (best: a company's rating is in the top decile of its industry) to 10 (lowest).\n\n## MSCI ESG Research\n\nMSCI is one of the world's best -known index providers. MSCI uses its own ESG ratings to create its sustainability indices. MSCI gave E.ON a rating of AA. Its rating scale extends from CCC to AAA .\n\n## Sustainalytics\n\nSustainalytics is a global leader in providing ESG and corporate governance research and ratings. In 2022 E.ON received overall Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating score of 23. 8 , which is at the medium r isk level. E.ON's position among multi -utilities is 22nd out of 84 companies .\n\n## ESG Asset Management and Pension\n\n## Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON links the provision and investment of pension assets to sustainable purposes: by financing a company pension plan and by considering sustainability criteria when making decisions about how the plan's assets are invested. E.ON draws, for example, on the Norwegian State Pension Fund's research and embargo lists in order to avoid questionable investments. We also select asset managers whose investment processes systematically take ESG aspects into account. In addition, E.ON continually develops its own ESG approach to the investment process in order to adapt to the latest developments at the Company and in the market.",

The OECD estimates that global GDP grew by 3.1 percent in 2022, which was lower than 5.6 -percent growth in 2021.\n\n## Economic Developments in the EU\n\nThe outbreak of the war abruptly changed the initially positive economic outlook for the entire EU and affected anticipate d GDP growth in the eurozone. According to the OECD, eurozone GDP only grew by 3.3 percent in 2022. Due to persistently high inflation throughout the eurozone during the year, in mid -2022 the European Central Bank ('ECB') reversed its monetary policy. In July the ECB raised the prime interest rate -for the first time in 16 years -by 0.5 percentage points. The next rate hike of 0.75 points -the biggest increase since the introduction of the common currencyfollowed in September, with additional increases of 0.75 and 0.5 points coming in late November and in mid -December. The ECB's aim in raising interest rates is to make credit more expensive, dampen demand, and thus counteract high inflation rates in order, over the medium term, to reduce inflation to the ECB's target of 2 percent. In the short term, the interest rate increase, which has already led to a rise in banks' interest rates, is likely to further dampen economic growth in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the sanctions against Russia imposed by the international community were and continue to be an important factor affecting the eurozone economy. Because Europe is highly dependent on Russia for energy, the sanctions have caused commodity prices to rise sharply. This resulted in general uncertainty on markets, which also adversely impacted the economy and, together with the historically high inflation rates in the EU and the United States, markedly worsened the economic outlook. Looming over all this was the additional threat of a European energy crisis, whose effect was felt not only in Germany but also in the other member states and significantly worsened the economic situation in Europe as a whole. The tense energy supply situation was exacerbated by Russia's suspension of gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline at the end of August and the damage to both Nord Stream pipelines.\n\nDespite the challenges for the winter of 2022/2023, Europe has managed to replace most of the discontinued supply of gas from Russia. The European Union procured additional natural gas, for example from Norway, as well as liquefied natural gas ('LNG')\n\nfrom the United States and Canada. The greater challenge will come in the winter of 2023/2024. The European Commission estimates that at the end of this summer there could be 30 billion c ubic meters of gas less than is needed to fill the EU's storage facilities.\n\n## Economic Developments in Germany\n\nIn the fall of 2021 the economic forecasts for Germany in 2022 painted an initially optimistic but also complex overall picture. In the view of the ifo Institute, although GDP was expected to increase significantly -by 5.1 percenteconomic growth would not benefit all sectors equally. The main reason for this, according to the assumptions, was the Covid -19 pandemic, whose impact, as in previous years, would vary by sector. The German economy entered 2022 with this mixed outlook.\n\nThe outbreak of the war dashed hopes for growth. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, addressing the Bundestag shortly afterward, spoke of a 'historical turning point.' The reorientation that was also announced has since then characterized policy decisions and legislation, especially in the energy sector. Since the start of the war and the concomitant accelerated rise in energy prices, the German federal government has initiated numerous laws to ensure the functioning of the gas market, to guarantee supply security, to ease the burden on industry and citizens, and thus also to help rein in the extremely high degree of uncertainty about future economic developments.\n\nIn March, Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck proclaimed the early warning stage of the gas emergency plan and, in late June, the alarm stage. To stabilize electricity and gas prices and then allow them to fall, in October the Bundestag also approved a \u20ac200 billion set of safeguards. After initially placing Gazprom Germania, now operating under the name SEFE Securing Energy for Europe GmbH ('SEFE'), in trusteeship in April, in late September the federal government took over Uniper, Germany's biggest gas importer, as an additional measure to secure the energy suppl y . The takeover by the federal government also ended",

SEFE too was nationalized in November. According to the Federal Network Agency, security of supply in Germany continues to be ensured, partly because by late November gas storage facilities had been refilled faster than expected thanks to extensive purchases. The situation remains under close observation, however, due to the continuing tense situation on the gas market.\n\nIn mid -October the German Cabinet adopted an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act to further manage risks. The law, which took effect in early December, stipulates that Emsland, Isar 2, and Neckarwestheim 2 nuclear power plants ('NPPs') can only use their remaining fuel rods to continue operating on a temporary basis. The NPPs must cease operating on April 15, 2023, at the latest. The use of new fuel rods is not permitted. In the case of Isar 2 NPP, which is operated by PreussenElektra GmbH, a wholly owned E.ON Group subsidiary, this required a brief shutdown, which was suitably prepared for, to overhaul pressurizer pilot valves. This measure was successfully carried out at the end of October. As it did for most generation technologies, the Germa n federal government introduced a levy on so -called excess earnings from nuclear energy from December 1, 2022, onward.\n\nDespite all the support measures taken by policymakers in the wake of the geopolitical upheavals, which can only gradually take effect, the economy was hit to a considerable extent by developments on energy markets and other commodity markets, which experienced similarly massive price increases. The economic recovery that had been predicted by research institutes last year proved to be a false hope. The strong start to the year initially gave cause for optimism. Beginning in the summer at the latest, however, Germany's economy cooled noticeably. According to Destatis, GDP did not increase or increased only slightly in the second and third quarters of 2022 (0.0 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, compared with the previous quarter). The OECD anticipates that Germany's GDP grew by 1.8 percent in 2022.\n\nRising inflation was felt by businesses and citizens throughout the year. The German government's fall forecast in mid -October assumed an average inflation rate of 8 percent for 2022 and 7 percent for 2023. The German Council of Economic Experts' November forecast had the same figure for 2022 and predicted inflation of 7.4 percent for 2023. One of the main reasons for high inflation is the development of energy prices.\n\nThe Covid -19 pandemic remained an important factor influencing the German economy in the year under review as well. Supply chains in particular continued to be severely disrupted worldwide, delaying a faster economic recovery. Although individual companies are already reporting improvements in their supply chain, the problems are likely to continue well into 2023. China, an important trading partner for Germany, plays a major role. The country continued, until the end of 2022, to adopt a strict and increasingly unpopular zero -covid strategy consisting of lockdowns, strict control, contact tracing, and forced quarantine. This repeatedly led to prolonged disruptions and supply bottlene cks for certain products such as semiconductors.\n\nInfection rates in Germany remained at a high level throughout 2022. On the positive side, the omicron variant of the virus now dominates infections and is less likely to lead to severe illness. In addition, vaccinated people require hospital treatment less frequently than unvaccinated people. As a result, high infection rates continued to lead to increased sick leave at companies, but no longer to the same extent to a burden on the healthcare system and to fatalities as was the case in the first waves.\n\n## Development of Energy Prices\n\nEnergy prices -and gas prices in particular -moved upward in 2022, in some cases sharply. The waning of the Covid -19 pandemic in the fall of 2021 favored an economic upswing and thus promoted an increase in energy demand, which put upward pressure on prices. In addition to this development, the Russia -Ukraine war and the subsequent sanctions triggered a shortage on the supply side, which likewise pushed up prices.\n\nAt the peak of the upward price spiral at the end of August 2022, the month -ahead contract for one MWh of gas at TTF, a virtual trading point in the Netherlands, cost \u20ac346, and the spot price rose above \u20ac300 as well. Prices settled at \u20ac64 and \u20ac82, respectively, at ye arend 2022. Geopolitical uncertainty was one reason for last year's massively exaggerated prices. The other was that German market area manager Trading Hub Europe GmbH in particular was very active in order to fill gas storage facilities, which were still unusually empty in the spring of 2022, as quickly as possible and to comply with the new legal requirements for filling gas storage facilities issued in May 2022. Storage facilities in Germany account for around 24 percent of EU -wide capacity; their accel erated filling therefore also affected the price situation in the EU as a whole.\n\nThe statutory requirement for Germany's gas storage facilities to be 95 percent full was met before the mandatory November 1 deadline. By mid -November, these facilities were 100 percent full. In addition, the exceptionally mild weather in October and the first half of November put downward pressure on prices. Although gas prices have now settled at a rather moderate level compared with the summer of 2022, it can be assumed that prices will remain at a high level eve n after the war and Covid -19.\n\n## Policy Measures to Control Energy Costs\n\nShortly after the start of the Russia -Ukraine war, individual member states called for Brussels to introduce a price cap on wholesale markets for natural gas. Different price -cap mechanisms were discussed during 2022. In May 2022, Spain and Portugal obtained the European Union's consent -dubbed the Iberian exception -to institute a price cap to reduce the impact of gas prices on energy prices for end -consumers. On December 19 the Council of the European Union decided to introduce a market correction mechanism. When its preconditions are met, the dynamic price cap is to remain in effect for 28 days and, under certain conditions, may be suspended automat ically or by a decision by the Commission.",

The value -added tax on gas was reduced from 19 percent to 7 percent for the period from October 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024. In addition, the increase in the carbon price of \u20ac5 per metric ton for heating oil, natural gas, and fuels, which was originally scheduled for the beginning of 2023, was postponed for one year. The carbon price rose to \u20ac30 per metric ton in 2022. The government took several steps for low -wage earners and social -transfer recipients, such as raising the tax -exempt amount, adjusting the housing allowance upward, and enacting heating cost subsidies.\n\nThe most far -reaching proposals, however, came from the Expert Commission on Gas and Heat formed by the federal government, which included E.ON CEO Leonhard Birnbaum. The commission submitted its final report to the government on October 31. It prop osed to relieve gas and district heating customers in two steps. The first step was for the government to make all payments for December, with the exception of payments for industry and power plants that generate electricity.\n\nThe second step was to cap gas and heat prices from the beginning of March 2023 until at least the end of April 2024. The German federal government embraced the recommendations and transposed them into legislation. The government adopted the oneoff one -month gas rebate recommended by the commission and passed a law to this effect on November 10. Households that use gas or district heating benefited from the emergency aid. SMEs that have standard load profile ('SLP') billing and that consume less than 1.5 million kWh of gas per year also had their December payment waived, as did, regardless of their annual consumption, social institutions such as hospitals, care facilities, and education institutions.\n\nThe commission also addressed the question of how to deal with imminent payment arrears in the customer relationship. It recommended the introduction of a hardship fund to cushion\n\nemergencies in a targeted and needs -based manner. The federal government and the German states largely followed this suggestion in the legislation on the electricity and gas price cap.\n\nGas price cap. The Bundestag enacted the gas price cap in mid -December 2022. The German federal government's draft legislation largely followed the recommendations of the Expert Commission on Gas and Heat. The European Commission also gave the green light. From March 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, at the latest, essentially those SLP customers that were also eligible for emergency aid will be granted relief by means of a guaranteed gas gross price of 12 cents per kWh for 80 percent of the ir projected annual consumption; for district heating, it is 9.5 cents per kWh. The contract price applies to the remaining 20 percent of consumption. The gas price cap applies retroactively to January 1, 2023. In March 2023 SLP customers were thus also credited with the relief amounts for January and February 2023.\n\nThe gas price cap applies to industry from January 1, 2023, onward. Industrial customers with consumption of more than 1.5 million kWh pay 7 cents per kWh as a net working price for gas for 70 p ercent of their consumption and 7.5 cents per kWh for district heating, although the law defines different refence figures for different end -consumers with regard to determining annual consumption. They are refunded the difference to their contractually agreedon working price. The gas price cap applies to around 25,000 companies and around 1,900 hospitals nationwide. It is expected to cost a bout \u20ac54 billion. Suppliers will be fully compensated with funds from the Economic Stabilization Fund.\n\nElectricity pr ice cap. The Bundestag passed the Electricity Price Cap Act at the end of December. The electricity price cap applies from March 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, at the latest. However, January and February are included retroactively. The electricity price for private consumers and SMEs with electricity consumption of up to 30,000 kWh will be capped at \u20ac0.40, including all taxes, levies, charges, and network fees. This rule applies to 80 percent of the forecast annual consumption or the\n\nprior year's consumption, which is calculated based on the distribution system operator's annual consumption forecast. This gives distribution system operators -and thus E.ON in particular -an important role to play in implementing the cap. Industrial customers pay \u20ac0.13 plus taxes, levies, and surcharges for 70 percent of their prior -year's consumption. Suppliers will be fully compensated for the electricity price cap as well.\n\nStabilization of the network fees for power transmission systems. The federal government's third relief package stabilizes the network fees for power transmission systems as well. They are set at 3.12 c ents kWh for the transmission system in 2023. This measure will cost just under \u20ac13 billion and will initially be financed from the budget of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (German abbreviation: 'EEG'), which had a positive balance of \u20ac18 billion late in 2022. Permanent relief of power transmission fees is to be provided by revenue from windfall profit tax on generation assets, which was established as part of the electricity price cap. So far there has been no direct relief for the distribution networks operated by E.ON.\n\nIn the wake of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' decision, the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (German abbreviation: 'BDEW') rightly pointed out that rising costs can be expected at distribution systems as well. These increases will burden households proportionally more than industry. The BDEW contends that relief is therefore also necessary for distribution system fees.\n\nTaxing windfall profits. EU member states decided at the end of September, on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission, to introduce a revenue cap of \u20ac180 per MWh in the wholesale electricity market. It applies to renewables, nuclear power, and lignite. The EU also decided to impose a solidarity charge on suppliers of oil, gas, and fuels. The Bundestag decided to tax the windfall profits of electricity producers not retroactively to September 1, 2022, but retroactively to December 1. The term of",

Developing countries that are particularly vulnerable are to benefit. However, no amounts are specified, and it remains unclear who is to pay into the fund. In addition, various countries reaffirmed the decision made in Glasgow last year to phase out coal. For the first time, the final document of a climate conference also calls for the expansion of renewables. However, the final declaration lacks a plan as to whether and by when the sum of $100 billion for climate protection and climate adaptation -this is how much the industrialized countries should have been paying to poor countries annually since 2020 -must be paid in arrears. The $100 billion are to go toward measures for climate adaptation that are st ill possible, while the new fund compensates for damage that has already occurred. Furthermore, countries are called on to improve their climate protection plans by the next climate conference at the latest, but the call is voluntary and not binding.\n\nThe next UN climate conference, COP28, is expected to take place in Dubai in 2023.\n\nAlthough the G20 meeting in Bali was overshadowed by the Russia -Ukraine war, the fight against climate change was on its agenda as well. In their final communiqu\u00e9, the heads of state and government reaffirmed their intention to act decisively against global warming and called for more efforts and better funding for\n\nprojects and measures. In addition, renewables expansion should be pursued as a high priority and solutions should be found to keep energy markets stable and energy prices affordable.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Impact of Climate Change on the Economy and Energy Supply in 2022\n\nThe series of heat waves across Europe along with unusually dry conditions posed significant challenges not only for people and nature, but also for Europe's economy and energy suppliers last year. 2022 was one of Europe's warmest years on record. Accordin g to data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, average temperatures from June to August were 0.4 degrees Celsius higher than the peak figures recorded in 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe heat and the lack of rain led to significant restrictions on shipping, especially on the Rhine. Low water levels prevented ships from carrying their usual loads, which increased transport costs and delivery times amid already strained supply chains.\n\nAt times less than half of France's 56 nuclear reactors were operating at full capacity because of maintenance and repair work, but also as a result of heat and drought and thus a shortage of cooling water from rivers. As a result, the share of nuclear power in the French electricity mix fell significantly, which in turn affected prices on the European wholesale markets .\n\nAmid the energy crisis caused by the Russia -Ukraine war and the increasingly apparent consequences of climate change for people, the environment, economy, and energy supply, the EU and the German federal government intensified measures, or intend to institute measures, to accelerate renewables expansion and propel the decarbonization of the economy.\n\nThe need for such policy measures is explained in the first biennial report of the Council of Experts on Climate Change. If Germany\n\nwants to achieve its climate targets for 2030, the amount of climate -damaging emissions displaced from 2022 to 2030 would have to more than double compared with 2011 to 2021. The Council of Experts states that the energy and building sectors in particular have contributed to the reduction of climate -damaging emissions achieved to date. For Germany to still achieve its climate targets by 2030, the industrial sector would have to increase its annual emissions savings roughly tenfold, the transport sector fourteenfold.\n\nIn line with its own corporate objectives, E.ON unambiguously supports policymakers' efforts to expand renewable power generation faster than planned and thus achieve climate targets. For this reason, last year E.ON also provided its expertise in support of much proposed legislation at both the European and federal level and advocated an ambitious climate policy backed by a clear regulatory framework for the energy sector.\n\nEU climate legislation. In response to the Russia -Ukraine war, in May the European Commission presented REPowerEU, a large package of proposals to accelerate renewables expansion and the move away from fossil fuels. It is designed to lessen dependence on Russian energy imports, reduce carbon emissions, and speed up renewables expansion. The plans, which will be incorporated into the Renewable Energy Directive ('RED IV') as a legislative revision, call, among other things, for raising the 2030 target for the proportion of renewables in the EU energy mix to 45 percent. This is to be achieved by accelerating the construction of renewable generating facilities, including in 'go -to areas' for renewables, which are to be defined by the member states. Existing legislation requires renewable energy facilities to meet at least 32 percent of the EU's energy needs by 2030.\n\nOn December 19 the Council of the European Commission also adopted, under Article 122, a temporary emergency regulation for expanding renewables. It took effect in late December 2022. The regulation accords renewables and the distribution networks to which they are connected an 'overriding public interest.' The",

        "page_content": "## Combined Group Management Report\n\n- \u2192 About this Report \u2192 Corporate Profile \u2192 Climate Protection and Environmental Management \u2192 Employees and Society\n- \u2192 Governance \u2192 Sustainable Finance\n- \u2192 Business Report\n- \u2192 Forecast Report \u2192 Risks and Chances Report\n- \u2192 Internal Control System\n- \u2192 Disclosures Regarding Takeovers\n- \u2192 Corporate Governance Declaration\n\nCommission has thus prioritized the expansion of renewables and power lines over other public concerns, such as bird and species protection. Other measures in Commission's emergency regulation shorten approval procedures for solar facilities and heat pumps and simplify the repowering of existing facilities.\n\nE.ON generally welcomes the measures proposed in REPowerEU and, partially, the accelerated rollout foreseen by the emergency regulation and is carefully following the consultation on RED IV. Yet E.ON points out that the expansion of smart energy grids in European member states must keep pace with renewables expansion. Without expanded infrastructure for transmitting and distributing energy, the EU's ambitious targets, which were raised last year, cannot be achieved.\n\nS imilarly ambitious expansion is needed for eMobility charging infrastructure. The EU decided at the end of October to allow only zero -emission vehicles in Europe from 2035 onward. It also wants to take a closer look at the use of eFuels. This fundamental decision will support the shift to electric vehicles ('EVs') and will thus the expansion of EV charging infrastructure. E.ON welcomes the decision as an effective climate policy to decarbonize the mobility sector, but points out that rapid expansion will require, in particular, simpler approval procedures and faster decisions on subsidy programs.\n\n## Germany\n\nShortly before the parliamentary summer break, the Bundestag passed the so -called Easter package of legislation to accelerate renewables expansion. In particular, the Energy Industry Act (German abbreviation: 'EnWG'), the Renewable Energy Sources Act (German abbreviation: 'EEG'), and the Offshore Wind Energy Act (German abbreviation: 'WindSeeG') were substantially amended. A total of 19 individual laws were amended. It was one of the largest energy policy amendments in recent decades.\n\nLawmakers increased the targets for renewables' share of gross electricity consumption from the previous 50 percent to 80\n\npercent. The focus will be shifted to the expansion of solar energy. Germany now aims to more than double its installed photovoltaic capacity, from 100 GW to more than 215 GW. To achieve this, ren ewables expansion is enshrined as an 'overriding public interest.' This means that renewable energy generation will be given priority in approval processes over, for example, considerations of construction and road law, water protection areas as well as forestry, emission control, and nature conservation law. This step aims to accelerate planning and approval processes.\n\nIn addition, lawmakers passed the Onshore Wind Energy Act to accelerate the expansion of onshore wind energy. It requires the federal states to designate 2 percent of their federal territory for wind energy by 2032. By 2027, 1.4 percent of this land is to be set aside for wind energy. Preference will be given to repowering old turbines at existing wind farms.\n\nIn line with its corporate strategy, E.ON has provided substantial assistance to the German federal government's initiatives to accelerate renewables expansion and thus to the Easter package. We will also work to support fast -track renewables growth by expanding our smart distribution grids. This will require, in particular, that the mechanisms for speeding up planning and approval processes prove to be effective. This is the only way for Germany to achieve its ambitious climate targets.\n\nThe amendment of the Metering Point Operation Act was another key piece of legislation for accelerating the energy transition. The federal government wants this law to accelerate the rollout of smart energy meters. A legislative initiative adopted by the cabinet in December aims to restart the smart energy meter rollout and achieve the goals of Germany's smart energy meter plan. The plan stipulates that every meter must be smart or at least equipped with a digital interface by 2032. Overall, the rollout of smart energy meters has been slow owing to technical and regulatory hurdles. E.ON had installed 4.9 million smart energy meters in Germany by year -end 2022.\n\nThe Charging Infrastructure Master Plan II is intended to provide more impetus to the decarbonization of road transport. The federal government intends to ensure the charging of millions of additional EVs. It plans to spend \u20ac6.3 billion through 2025 to fund the expansion. E.ON welcomes the federal government's intention to no longer measure success in expanding eMobility charging infrastructure on a predefined number of charging points, but to look instead at actual demand, while considering a variety of charging solutions. Federal, state, and local governments also need to demonstrate that they can accelerate approval and funding processes.\n\nRedispatch 2.0 dragged on for more than a year until the Federal Network Agency provided clarity in November 2022. System operators conduct redispatch by modifying the feed -in from generation resources like power stations in order to avoid network congestion. Since November, balancing group managers must receive immediate and detailed notification of redispatch measures, including the planned date, scope, and duration of the adjustment of active or reactive power generation. In addition, the Federal Network Agency clarified that prepayments to balancing group managers must be settled precisely. Network operators are therefore required to estimate lost load as accurately as possible. The agency also requires network operators to ensure that the balancing calculation factors in balance -sheet compensation as well.\n\nIn the Act on the Introduction of an Electricity Price Cap, lawmakers gave the Federal Network Agency, among other things, the option under the Energy Industry Act to deviate from previous practice and set reference periods or reference figures for calculating the return on equity of distribution system operators. We expect the Federal Network Agency to address the problem of increased terms for debt financing without delay.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom is facing its worst energy crisis in decades. The U.K. government is spending around \u00a316 billion (\u20ac19 billion)",

The Energy Price Guarantee caps variable standard tariffs. A typical U.K. household will save about \u00a3900 over this period compared with undiscounted energy prices under the price cap. The U.K. government's 2022 Autumn Statement announced that the Energy Price G uarantee will be extended from April 2023 to April 2024. A typical U.K. household's energy bill will lowered to around \u00a33,000 over this period. Forecasts for undiscounted energy prices indicate that the capping of variable standard tariffs will yield savings of about \u00a3500.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nIn 2022 the Dutch government adopted a roughly \u20ac11.2 billion relief package for its citizens. The government is using the money to finance a price cap in effect since January 2022 on a portion of households' and small businesses' electricity and gas consumption. In addition, the Netherlands paid a \u20ac190 lump -sum rebate to all households for November and December. Low -income citizens will receive an additional payment of \u20ac1,300. The government took the additional step of lowering the VAT on energy from 21 to 9 percent .\n\n## Italy\n\nThe previous government under Prime Minister Mario Draghi adopted several aid packages. I t supported companies in Italy and relieved the burden on citizens by providing aid loans and reducing the VAT on fuels . The government extended the applicable fuel discount of 30 cents per liter several times during the year. The new government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, on the other hand, reduced the fuel discount to 18 cents per liter effective December 1. It is also increasing the minimum pension by 20 percent and reducing nonwage labor costs by 2 percent, or 3 percent in the case of low incomes. The new government's budget law provides a total of \u20ac66 billi on in relief.\n\n## Sweden\n\nAfter the Social Democratic government was voted out of office in September, a right -wing three -party coalition was formed and confirmed in office in October. High electricity prices were a key topic of the energy policy debate in Sweden as well. In particular, the country's existing four price zones were called into question. In 2021, for example, the price level in southern Sweden was more than twice as high as in the North. This structural problem remained in 2022. An amendment to electricity network regulation took effect on June 1, 2021. The Ministry of Environment and Energy is currently working on an electrification strategy. The Ministry of Infrastructure established a Commission for Electrification that was active until the end of 2022.\n\n## East -Central Europe\n\nThe Czech Republic enacted a gas price cap and an electricity price cap for households and small consumers. Electricity costs 6 crowns (25 cents) per kWh; gas, 3 crowns (12 cents). The government estimates that the resulting costs are equal to about \u20ac5.3 billion. Large consumers, such as those in industry, can apply for subsidies.\n\nPoland has been particularly hard hit by high energy prices. It still imported 60 percent of its coal from Russia in 2021 and thus has taken far -reaching measures to ease the burden on citizens. Among other things, the Polish parliament passed an electricity price cap in the fall. Households up to an annual consumption of 2,000 to 3,000 kWh will pay the 2022 electricity price equal to \u20ac88.70 per MWh. Companies up to a certain size will pay no more than the equivalent of around \u20ac167 net per MWh between December 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. The same cap applies to public entities. Since many people in Poland still use coal for heating, the government has already paid out a one -time coal subsidy equal to \u20ac650 per household and set a price cap equal to about \u20ac420 per metric ton of coal that municipalities sell to citizens from January 1, 2023, onward.\n\nThe Romanian government capped gas and electricity bills for consumers up to a certain level of monthly consumption. The cap for an average household is equal to \u20ac1 36 per MWh for electricity and \u20ac62 per MWh for gas. In return, suppliers receive compensation from the state to cover the shortfall.\n\nHungary's government discontinued the residential utility cost cap introduced in 2014 due to soaring energy prices. However, it emphasized that subsidized prices for gas and electricity would only rise for those households that consume more than the average. These households must pay the market price for the difference since August 1, 2022. This, in turn, will amount to a multiple of the subsidized prices.\n\n## Special Events in the Reporting Period Corporate Bonds Issued\n\nThe following bonds were issued in the 2022 financial year:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac500 million bond that matures in January 2026 and has a coupon of 0.125 percent (January 2022)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac800 million green bond that matures in October 2034 and has a coupon of 0.875 percent (January 2022)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in January 2025 and has a coupon of 0.875 percent (March 2022)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in March 2031 and has a coupon of 1.625 percent (March 2022)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac600 million bond that matures in August 2028 and has a coupon of 2.875 percent (August 2022)\n- \u00b7 NOK 1,500 million private placement that matures in September 2032 and has a coupon of 5.02 percent. It is fully hedged for interest rate and currency. Including the hedging transaction, this yields a euro -denominated liability of roughly \u20ac150 million",

It is fully hedged for interest rate and currency. Including the hedging transaction, this yields a euro -denominated liability of roughly \u20ac158 million with an interest rate of 3.49 percent per annum (December 2022).\n- \u00b7 CHF 145 million bond that matures in December 2029 and has a coupon of 2.503 percent. It is fully hedged for interest rate and currency. Including the hedging transaction, this yields a euro -denominated liability of roughly \u20ac148 million with an interest rate of 3.98 percent per annum (December 2022).\n\n## Russia-Ukraine War Creates Significant Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Impacts the Energy Sector\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The situation on energy markets has since then remained tense. E.ON's priority in these turbulent times is to secure the energy supply. The power, gas, and heat networks that E.ON operates in various regions of Europe are running stably, even in the current situation.\n\nThe war's repercussions also have implications for E.ON's business, in particular the rise in commodity prices during the year. These implications are described in greater detail below in the chapters entitled 'Earnings Situation' and 'Financial Situation.' In addition, the stake in Nord Stream AG held in pension plan assets was reduced to its fair value of zero at December 31 2022. The write -down, which reduced equity, was recognized in other non -operating income. The situation assessable at the balance -sheet date indicated no other triggering events directly related to the war that would necessitate impairment charges on non -current assets.\n\n## Conclusion of a Future Consolidation Agreement with ZSE Shareholders\n\nOn April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') and of V\u00fdchodoslovensk\u00e1 energetika Holding a.s. ('VSEH'), E.ON SE, and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Gr oup. The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all or selected VSEH subsidiaries to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate law changes at VSEH.\n\nThe transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE will result in ZSE becoming VSEH's sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of selected VSEH subsidiaries). The ownership interests in ZSE will remain unchanged; that is, E.ON will have a 49 -percent stake in VSE and the Slovakian state a 51 -percent stake. The new ZSE shareholders agreement, which has yet to be concluded, will essentially correspond to the current shareholders agreement. After the transaction, ZSE will thus continue to be included in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements as a jointly owned company and accounted for using the equity method. After closing, the VSEH's business operations, which previously had been fully consolidated, will be accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 20 23.\n\n## Disposal of Universal Service Provider Business in Hungary\n\nTo further optimize E.ON's portfolio in Hungary, E.ON Hung\u00e1ria Zrt. signed an agreement with MVM Zrt. on February 23, 2022, to sell 100 percent of its stake in E.ON \u00c1ramszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. ('E\u00c1S') . E\u00c1S holds a regional universal service provider license under which it supplies electricity to customers in certain regions of Hungary. The transaction closed on April 14, 2022.\n\n## E.ON and Igneo Establish Joint Venture for Accelerated High-Speed Broadband Rollout\n\nIn mid -July E.ON and Igneo Infrastructure Partners signed an agreement to found a joint venture for the rollout of high -speed broadband infrastructure in Germany. For this purpose, Igneo acquired a 50percent stake in Westconnect GmbH (formerly Westenergie Breitband GmbH), which was previously a wholly owned E.ON SE subsidiary. The transaction closed on October 31, 2022. In the future, the joint venture intends to provide fiber -optic broadband connections to more than 1.5 million households and wholesale customers in Germany.\n\nE.ON subsidiary Westenergie remains a 50 -percent shareholder; the company's activities will be recorded in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.\n\nOn Capital Markets Day in the fall of 2021, E.ON announced that it planned to conduct \u20ac2 to \u20ac4 billion of portfolio optimization. The Igneo transaction is the first such measure.\n\n## Contract of Management Board Chairman Leonhard Birnbaum Extended to 2028\n\nAt its meeting in late September 2022, the E.ON SE Supervisory Board extended the contract of Management Board Chairman Leonhard Birnbaum by five more years until June 30, 2028. Birnbaum has been a member of the E.ON Management Board since 2013 and its Chairman since April 2021.\n\n## Agreement on the Temporary Continued Operation of Germany's Remaining Nuclear Power Plants\n\nE.ON supports the amended Atomic Energy Act which makes possible the temporary continued operation of the three nuclear power plants ('NPPs') that remain online. This has enabled generating capacity to be maintained in the winter of 2022/2023 to stabilize the German power grid. The authorization of Emsland, Neckarwestheim 2, and Isar 2 NPPs (the latter of which is operated by PreussenElektra, an E.ON subsidiary) to operate does",

Germany's NPPs can make a valuable contribution toward securing the energy supply amid the crisis and put downward pressure on prices.\n\nIsar 2 may operate with its existing reactor core until April 15, 2023, at the latest. From January 1, 2023, onward PreussenElektra could earn power -market revenues for about 2 TWh of Isar 2's electricity output. These potential revenues must be set against the additional costs arising from the extension and the provisions of the Act on the Introduction of Electricity Price Caps and the Amendment of Other Energy Law Provisions (German abbreviation: 'StromBP') on the recovery of electricity market proceeds, which took effect on December 24, 2022.\n\nE.ON plans that any possible revenues resulting from Isar 2's continued operation will be used for the energy transition, such as for network infrastructure and the development of its hydrogen business.\n\n## LNG Terminal in Brunsb\u00fcttel Connected to E.ON Subsidiary's Gas Distribution Network\n\nIn December 2022, after less than three months of actual construction time, the technical requirements for the connection of the liquefied natural gas (' LNG ') terminal in Brunsb\u00fcttel in Schleswig -Holstein were established. In this phase of the project, the jetty for the floating LNG terminal was connected to the gas distribution network of Schleswig -Holstein Netz AG ('SH Netz'), which belongs to E.ON subsidiary HanseWerk AG, by means of a three -kilometer pipeline belonging to Gasunie. SH Netz has enabled the onward transport of the LNG gas to Germany by installing a large new special pipe network station in Brunsb\u00fcttel to regulate the gas flow as well as by making a variety of technical specifications at various gas transfer stations in its distribution network. SH Netz's pipelines are future -proof and in the future could transport hydrogen as well.\n\n## Subsequent Events\n\n## E.ON Successfully Issues Two Bonds in January 2023\n\nE.ON successfully issued two bonds totaling \u20ac1.8 billion:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac800 million bond that matures in January 2028 and has a cou pon of 3.5 percent\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1 billion green bond that matures in January 2035 and has a coupon of 3.875 percent.\n\n## Earthquakes in Southeast Turkey and Northern Syria\n\nSoutheastern Turkey and northern Syria experienced several major earthquakes on February 6, 2023, and in the days afterward. They resulted in electricity and gas service outages. As a precaution, natural gas and crude oil flows were suspended. At E.ON, Enerjisa Enerji's supply territory was affected; it the affected area it supplies around 8.5 million inhabitants. Enerjisa \u00dcretim had outages at lignite -fired and hydro power plants. In addition, near freezing temperatures and rainfall hampered ongoing operations. E.ON is working to restore service in the area as quickly as possible and to repair damage. From today's perspective, it is not yet possible to estimate the earthquake's cumulative impact.\n\n## Business Performance\n\nE .ON's operating business delivered a positive performance in the 2022 financial year, and E.ON surpassed its forecast for several key performance indicators.\n\nSales in the 2022 financial year increased by 50 percent to \u20ac115.7 billion. Customer Solutions delivered a large part of the increase, which to a great extent reflected price increases on commodity markets. This primarily affected the sales business in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the E.ON Group of \u20ac8.1 billion was \u20ac0.2 billion above the prior -year figure and also above the forecast\n\nrange of \u20ac7.6 to \u20ac7.8 billion. Energy Networks recorded adjus ted EBITDA of \u20ac5.5 billion, which was at the upper end of the forecast range of \u20ac5.3 to \u20ac5.5 billion that was revised in November 2022 (previously: \u20ac5.5 to \u20ac5.7 billion). Customer Solutions' adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac1.7 billion was also at the upper end of the forecast range of \u20ac1.5 to \u20ac1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA recorded under Corporate Functions/Other of -\u20ac0.2 billion reflects the forecast of -\u20ac0.2 billion. NonCore Business posted adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac1.1 billion, which was at the upper end of the forecast range of \u20ac0.9 to \u20ac1.1 billion, which was revised in November 2022 (previously: \u20ac0.6 to \u20ac0.8 billion). Adjusted net income of \u20ac2.7 billion was around \u20ac0.2 billion above the prior -year figure and above the forecast range of \u20ac2.3 to \u20ac2.5 billion. Earnings per share, which are based on adjusted net income, amounted to \u20ac1.0 5 in the year under review (prior year: \u20ac0.96) and thus surpassed the forecast range of \u20ac0.88 to \u20ac0.96. The core business achieved a large share of the positive developments in the operating business. At the network business they are attributable to a variety of items, including cost savings, the leveraging of synergies, and further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments. The increase at Customer Solutions was generated primarily by the sales business as well as the EIS business. The main factors in the positive earnings performance were relatively mild weather, a significant reduction in customer churn amid the energy crisis, and the leveraging of synergies.\n\nCash -effective investments of \u20ac4.8 billion were at the prior -year level of \u20ac4.8 billion and thus below the target figure of \u20ac5.3 billion. Energy Networks' investments of \u20ac3.8 billion were below the forecast figure of \u20ac4.1 billion due to delays in the implementation of network projects. Customer Solutions' investments of \u20ac0. 8 billion were likewise below the forecast figure of \u20ac1.1. billion. The deviation is largely attributable to delays in the realization of the EIS business's projects. Investments of \u20ac0.1 billion at Corporate Functions/Other were in line with the forecast figure. Non -Core Business's investments were negligibly low and reflected the forecast figure of \u20ac0 billion.",

Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains detailed information about them:\n\n- \u00b7 Westenergie AG's consortium agreement with RheinEnergie and the reclassification of the stake in Stadtwerke Duisburg as an asset held for sale\n- \u00b7 Partial disposal of Stromnetzgesellschaft Essen GmbH & Co. KG and the reverse leasing model .\n- \u00b7 Partial disposal of Westconnect GmbH and thus its inclusion as a company accounted for by means of the equity method\n- \u00b7 Continued classification of VSEH as a disposal group due to the planned combination with ZSE in Slovakia\n- \u00b7 Sale of the universal service provider ('USP') business in Hungary.\n\nCash provided by investing activities of continuing operations included cash -effective disposal proceeds totaling \u20ac1.1 billion in 2022 (prior year: \u20ac1 .0 billion) .\n\n## Earnings Situation\n\n## Sales\n\nThe E.ON Group's sales in the 2022 financial year rose by \u20ac38.3 billion year on year to \u20ac115.7 billion.\n\nEnergy Networks' sales of \u20ac20.3 billion were \u20ac2 billion above the prioryear figure. The network business in Germany contributed this development, due in part to the expansion of its regulated asset base and to the increased upstream network costs of power transmission systems, which, pursuant to statutory regulations, distribution network operators must pass through in their network fees .\n\nThe \u20ac34.8 billion increase in Customer Solutions' sales to \u20ac96.2 billion mainly reflects price increases on commodity markets caused by the energy crisis and impacts, in particular, the sales business in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.\n\nSales at Non -Core Business declined by \u20ac0.6 billion year on year to \u20ac1.1 billion, mainly because Brokdorf and Grohnde nuclear power plants were shut down as planned on December 31, 2021. The dec rease was only partially offset by higher sales prices on power marketed from Isar 2 nuclear power plant.\n\nSales recorded at Corporate Functions/Other rose by \u20ac40.5 billion year on year to \u20ac57.8 billion. The increase is mainly attributable to the fact that E.ON Energy Markets, our central commodity procurement unit, expanded its business operations by acquiring the portfolios of additional business units. In addition, the settlement of derivatives (+\u20ac3.7 billion relative to the prior year) amid rising prices on commodity markets led to significantly higher sales. The internal service relationships from central energy procurement are offset by corresponding consolidations.\n\n## Sales\n\n|                           | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions             | 2022             | 2021             | +/- %            | 2022        | 2021        | +/- %       |\n| Energy Networks           | 5,656            | 5,005            | 13               | 20,258      | 18,273      | 11          |\n| Customer Solutions        | 32,963           | 23,209           | 42               | 96,221      | 61,428      | 57          |\n| Non-Core  Business        | 308              | 559              | -45              | 1,060       | 1,632       | -35         |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | 26,761           | 8,624            | 210              | 57,776      | 17,265      | 235         |\n| Consolidation             | - 31,621         | - 8,126          | -289             | - 59,655    | - 21,240    | -181        |\n| E.ON Group                | 34,067           | 29,271           | 16               | 115,660     | 77,358      | 50          |",

Own work capitalized consisted predominantly of network investments as well as ongoing and completed IT projects.\n\nOther operating income totaled \u20ac7 3 , 193 in 2022 (prior year: \u20ac47,383 million). Income from derivative financial instruments alone rose by \u20ac25, 497 million year on year to \u20ac70,234 million owing mainly to the development of prices on commodity prices during the course of the year.\n\nIncome from currency -translation effects of \u20ac853 million was \u20ac375 million above the prior -year figure (\u20ac478 million). Corresponding amounts resulting from currency -translation effects and derivative financial instruments are recorded under other operating expenses. Income from sale of equity interests and securities totaled \u20ac999 million (prior year: \u20ac360 million). This mainly consists of the income of \u20ac810 million on the partial disposal of Westconnect GmbH.\n\nCosts of materials of \u20ac10 8 , 627 million were significantly above the prior -year level (\u20ac78,096 million). The increase is primarily attributable to higher energy prices on commodity markets. This led to higher direct procurement costs, but also meant that forward procurement contacts, which under IFRS are accounted for as derivative financial instruments, had to be adjusted to the current market price at the time of settlement. Income from the\n\nmarking to market of commodity derivatives is recorded under other operating income. In addition, a change in provisions for pending transactions was recognized in costs of materials. These provisions were mainly created for contracted sales transactions that are not subject to IFRS 9 (failed own -use transactions) but that are commercially part of a portfolio that is partially offset by procurement transactions that are accounted for as derivative financial instruments.\n\nPersonnel costs of \u20ac 5,437 million were \u20ac 400 million below the prioryear figure of \u20ac 5,837 million. The change is mainly attributable to a decline in the number of employees and lower expenditures for pension schemes. Lower expenditures for restructuring measures were an additional factor.\n\nDepreciation charges declined from \u20ac3,922 in the prior year to \u20ac3,378 million. This is principally attributable to a decrease in scheduled depreciation charges of -\u20ac397 million (prior year: +\u20ac29 million). This decline mainly reflects the closure of Grohnde and Brokdorf nuclear power plants.\n\nOther operating expenses of \u20ac71, 736 million were \u20ac40,071 million above the prior -year level (\u20ac31,665 million), chiefly because expenditures relating to derivative financial instruments (including currency -translation changes) rose by \u20ac 40,177 million to \u20ac66, 663 million. Expenditures relating to currency -translation effects declined by \u20ac361 million to \u20ac524 million.\n\nIncome from companies accounted for under the equity method of \u20ac279 million was significantly below the prior -year level (\u20ac505 million). The decline resulted mainly from adverse earnings effects in conjunction with the application of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) in Turkey .\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, we use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted to exclude extraordinary effects ('adjusted EBITDA') for the internal control of our intended growth and as an indicator of our business units' sustainable earnings strength.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\n|                                                  | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                    | 2022             | 2021             | +/- %            | 2022        | 2021        | +/- %       |\n| Energy Networks                                  | 1,390            | 1,118            | 24               | 5,459       | 4,988       | 9           |\n| Customer Solutions                               | 269              | 171              | 57               | 1,686       | 1,493       | 13          |\n| Thereof: Energy Infrastructure Solutions (\"EIS\") | 203              | 170              | 19               | 568         | 479         | 19          |\n| Corporate Functions/Other                        | -14              | -48              | 71               | -165        | -213        | 23          |\n| Consolidation                                    | -2               | 5                | -140             | -5          | 4           | -225        |\n| Adjusted EBITDA from core business               | 1,643            | 1,246            | 32               | 6,975       | 6,272       | 11          |\n| Non- Core Business                               | 306              | 366              | -16              | 1,084       | 1,617       | -33         |\n| E.ON Group adjusted EBITDA                       | 1,949            | 1,612            | 21               | 8,059       | 7,889       | 2           |",

This segment recorded a variety of effects. The positive factors in Germany included further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments, the leveraging of planned synergies from the integration of innogy, cost savings, and the recovery of adverse earnings effects. These effects were partially offset by higher commodity prices and warmer weather. Earnings in Sweden declined because of higher costs for upstream networks and a reduction of wheeling volume due in part to warmer weather. The earnings decline at East -Central Europe/Turkey is chiefly attributable to higher procurement costs for network losses (especially in Romania and Hungary), the disposal of two network operators in Hungary in the third quarter of 2021, and lower wheeling volume due in part to weather factors .\n\nAdjusted EBITDA at Customer Solutions increased by \u20ac193 million year on year to \u20ac1,686 million . Lower acquisition costs in Germany due to reduced customer churn and the leveraging of synergies as part of the innogy integration had a positive effect on earnings. Positive weather effects and earnings effects from the dynamic procurement strategy contributed to the increase in the Netherlands. Earnings in the United Kingdom declined owing to weather and consumption factors as well as precautionary measures related to payment defaults, particularly for residential customers and small and medium -sized enterprises, which could only be partially offset by cost savings achieved by the ongoing restructuring program. Distributed Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') is another unit of the Customer Solutions segment. Adjusted EBITDA at EIS increased from \u20ac479 million in the prior year to \u20ac568 million, primarily owing to investments .\n\nAdjusted EBITDA recorded at Corporate Functions/Other improved by \u20ac48 million year on year to -\u20ac165 million, in particular because of cost savings .\n\nAdjusted EBITDA at Non -Core Business decreased by \u20ac533 million to \u20ac1,084 million. This i s primarily attributable to the non -recurrence of the one -off effect recorded in 2021 relating to the agreement between the German government and nuclear power plant operators on nuclear power output rights and the resulting refund of residual power purchases. The fact that Brokdorf and Grohnde nuclear power plants were shut down as planned on December 31, 2021, adversely affected earnings as well. These factors were partially offset by higher sales prices relative to the prior year. The provisions of the Act on the Introduction of an Electricity Price Cap and the amendment of other energy laws (such as 'StromBP') to tax windfall electricity market profits (which apply from December 1, 2022, onward) adversely impacted earnings for the first time.\n\nThe E.ON Group recorded adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac8,059 million, which was \u20ac170 million above the prior -year figure. This improvement resulted from the aforementioned developments in the core business, which were partially offset by lower earnings at NonCore Business.\n\nE.ON generates a large portion of its adjusted EBITDA in very stable businesses. Regulated, quasi -regulated, and long -term contracted businesses accounted for the overwhelming proportion of E.ON's adjusted EBITDA in 2022.\n\nE.ON's regulated business consists in part of operations in which revenues are largely set by law and based on costs. The earnings with regard to such approved cost components are therefore extremely stable and predictable. E.ON's quasi -regulated and longterm contracted business consists of operations in which earnings have a high degree of predictability because key determinants (price and/or volume) are largely set for the medium to long term. Examples include the operation of industrial customer solutions\n\nwith long -term supply agreements and the operation of heating networks.\n\nMerchant activities are all those that cannot be subsumed under either of the other two categories.",

Internal management control considers these non-operating items separately. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income reflect the E.ON Group's long-term profitability and are key performance indicators for purposes of internal management control. They are therefore adjusted to exclude non-operating items.\n\nNet book gains surpassed the prior-year figure owing to a partial disposal and the agreement between E.ON and igneo to found a joint-venture company for the purpose of expanding high-speed broadband infrastructure in Germany (see 'Special Events in the Reporting Period').\n\nRestructuring expenses were lower than in the 2021 financial year and consisted, as in the prior year, primarily of expenditures in\n\nconnection with the restructuring of the sales business in the United Kingdom.\n\nEffects in conjunction with derivative financial instruments changed by -\u20ac6,373 million to -\u20ac3,123 million. The settlement of sales and procurement transactions recognized in the prior year as derivatives with positive fair values and the decline in the fair value measurement of unrealized sales and procurement transactions in line with price developments at year-end were mainly responsible for this change.\n\nNon-operating earnings consist mainly of valuation effects for non-current provisions as well as earnings effects in the equity valuation of shareholdings in Turkey in conjunction with the application of IAS 29. This was partially offset by valuation effects for bonds denominated in foreign currencies. The prior-year figure was adversely affected by valuation effects for repurchase obligations pursuant to IAS 32 and by non-current provisions as well as realized effects resulting from hedging transactions for certain currency risks.",

At the forefront of this strategy is ensuring that E.ON always has access to capital markets commensurate with its debt level.\n\nWith its target capital structure E.ON aims to sustainably secure a strong BBB/Baa rating.\n\nE.ON manages its capital structure using debt factor, which is equal to economic net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA; it is therefore a dynamic debt metric. Economic net debt includes not only financial liabilities but also provisions for pensions and asset -retirement obligations.\n\nThe increase in interest rates -including on asset -retirement obligations -put to an end the negative real interest rates that prevailed through September 30, 2022. Unlike in the prior year, the actual amount of asset -retirement obligations (without factoring in discounting and cost -escalation effects) exceeded the provisions shown in the balance sheet. This eliminates the limitation of economic net debt's relevance as key figure for purposes of management control that existed from year -end 2016 to September 30, 2022. Effective year -end 2022, E.ON therefore again uses the provisions shown in the balance sheet to calculate economic net debt.\n\nPursuant to IFRS valuation standards, innogy's financial liabilities at the time of initial consolidation were recorded at their fair value. This fair value is significantly higher than the original nominal value because interest -rate levels have declined since innogy's bonds were issued. The purchase -price allocation yielded a d ifference between the nominal value and the fair value, which results in additional liabilities of \u20ac1.7 billion at year -end 2022. This amount will be recorded in financial earnings as a reduction in expenditures and spread out over the maturity period of the respective bonds (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial\n\nStatements. These balance -sheet and earnings effects do not alter the interest and principal payments. To manage economic net debt, E.ON continues to use the nominal amount of financial liabili ties, which deviates from the figure shown in its balance sheets.\n\nE.ON so far aimed for a debt factor of 4.8 to 5.2. Debt factor at yearend 2022 of 4.1 was significantly below this target range. Going forward, E.ON aims for a debt factor of up to 5.0.\n\n## Economic Net Debt\n\nEconomic net debt declined by \u20ac6.1 billion relative to year -end 2021 (\u20ac38.8 billion) to \u20ac3 2.7 billion.\n\nFinancial liabilities of \u20ac32.5 billion reflect E.ON SE's issuance of bonds in the year under review as well as the repayment of five bonds (details on page 1 06 ). Short -term interim financing was paid down as well.\n\nE.ON's net financial position improved by \u20ac3.1 billion compared with year -end 2021 to about \u20ac21.6 billion. E.ON SE's dividend payment and investment expenditures as well as margin payments in conjunction with the development of commodity prices were more than offset by operating cash flow.\n\nThe increase in actuarial discount rates for pensions, which led to a reduction in defined benefit obligations, offset the decline in the return on plan assets and, on balance, had a positive impact on economic net debt (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The reduction in provisions for asset -retirement obligations mainly resulted from the utilization of provisions for a sset -retirement obligations in the nuclear energy business (see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Because the utilization affects operating cash flow, it had no overall effect on economic net debt.\n\n## Economic Net Debt\n\n|                                  | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                    | 2022           | 2021           |\n| Liquid funds                     | 9,378          | 5,965          |\n| Non- current securities          | 1,347          | 1,699          |\n| Financial liabilities 1          | - 32,483       | - 32,730       |\n| FX hedging adjustment            | 196            | 391            |\n| Net financial position           | -21,562        | -24,675        |\n| Provisions for pensions          | - 3,735        | - 6,082        |\n| Asset - retirement obligations 2 | - 7,445        | - 8,016        |\n| Economic net debt                | -32,742        | -38,773        |\n\n1 Bonds formerly issued by innogy are recorded at their nominal value. The figure shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is \u20ac1.7 billion higher (year -end 2021: \u20ac1.9 billion higher). 2 This figure is again the same as the asset -retirement obligations shown in theBalance Sheets (\u20ac7,445 million at December 31, 2022). The figure at December 31, 2021, is calculated in part based on the actual amount of E.ONs' obligations and therefore differs from the Balance Sheet amount of \u20ac9,230 million.\n\n## Funding Policy and Initiatives\n\nThe key objective of E.ON's funding policy is for the Company to have access to a variety of financing sources at all times. E.ON achieves this objective by using different markets and debt instruments to maximize the diversity of its investor base. E.ON issues bonds with tenors that give its debt portfolio a balanced maturity profile. Moreover, large -volume euro -denominated benchmark issues may in some cases be combined with bonds denominated in foreign currencies, smaller euro -denominated issues, private placements, and/or promissory notes. Furthermore, from 2019 onward E.ON has issued green bonds and has since established them in its financing mix. E.ON intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual long -term financing requirements with green bonds (the 'E.ON on Capital Markets' chapter contains information about the E.ON Green Bond Framework).\n\nExternal funding is generally carried out by E.ON SE, and the funds are subsequently on -lent in the Group. In the past, external funding was also carried out by the Company's Dutch finance subsidiary, E.ON International Finance B.V. ('EIF'), under guarantee of E.ON SE. In 2022 E.ON paid back in full maturities of",

E.ON issued new debt totaling \u20ac3.9 billion (see 'Special Events in the Reporting Period').\n\nWith the exception of a U.S. -dollardenominated bond issued in 2008, all of E.ON SE and EIF's currently outstanding bonds were issued under a Debt Issuance Program ('DIP'). Similarly, innogy and innogy Finance B.V. bonds were formerly issued under the former innogy Group's DIP. A DIP simplifies a company's ability to issue debt to investors in public and private placements in flexible time frames. E.ON SE's DIP was last updated in March 2022 with a total volume of \u20ac35 billion, of which about \u20ac18.4 billion was utilized at year -end 2022. E.ON SE intends to renew the DIP in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to its DIP, E.ON has a \u20ac10 billion Commercial Paper ('CP') program and a US$10 billion CP program, under which it can issue short -term notes. After years of inactivity, the U.S. dollar CP program was utilized again in 2022. \u20ac0.8 billion of CP was outstanding at year -end 2022 (prior year: \u20ac1.5 billion ).\n\nE.ON also has access to \u20ac3.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which was concluded on October 24, 2019. It originally had a five -year term and includes two options to extend the facility, in each case for one year. After both options to extend the facility were\n\nexercised, the term of the credit facility ends on October 24, 2026. The credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON fina ncial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as a reliable, ongoing general liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be drawn on as needed. The credit facility is made available by 21 banks which constitute E.ON's core group of banks.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\n|                   |   December 31, |   December 31, |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in billions     |         2022   |         2021   |\n| Bonds 1           |           27.2 |           26.4 |\n| EUR               |           19.3 |           18   |\n| GBP               |            6.1 |            7.1 |\n| USD               |            1   |            0.9 |\n| JPY               |            0.3 |            0.3 |\n| Other currencies  |            0.6 |            0.1 |\n| Promissory notes  |            0   |            0   |\n| Commercial paper  |            0.8 |            1.5 |\n| Other liabilities |            4.5 |            4.8 |\n| Total             |           32.5 |           32.7 |\n\n1 Includes private placements.\n\nA longside financial liabilities, E.ON has, in the course of its business operations, entered into contingencies and other financial obligations. These include, in particular, guarantees, obligations from legal disputes and damage claims, as well as current and noncurrent contractual, legal, and other obligations. Notes 27, 28, and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more information about E.ON's bonds as well as liabilities, contingencies, and other commitments.\n\nE.ON's creditworthiness has been assessed by Standard & Poor's ('S&P') and Moody's with long -term ratings of BBB and Baa2, respectively. The outlook for both ratings is stable. In both cases\n\nthe ratings are based on the expectation that, over the near to medium term, E.ON will be able to maintain a debt ratio commensurate with these ratings. S&P's and Moody's short -term ratings are unchanged at A -2 and P2, respectively.\n\nIn May 2022 E.ON decided to commission Fitch Ratings to assess its creditworthiness as well. The Company is therefore assessed by all three major rating agencies. Fitch rates E.ON's corporate credit risk at BBB+ with a stable outlook, its bonds at A -, and its commercial paper at F2.\n\n## E.ON SE Ratings\n\n| Long term   | S&P BBB   | Moodys' Baa2   | Fitch BBB+   |\n|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|\n| Outlook     | Stable    | Stable         | Stable       |\n| Bonds       | BBB       | Baa2           | A- F -2      |\n| Short term  | A-2       | P-2            |              |",

Alongside the ongoing dialog with capital market investors (at roadshows, for example) and rating analysts, E.ON organizes events that include an annual informational meeting for its core group of banks.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe E.ON Group's cash -effective investments of \u20ac4.8 billion in the 2022 financial year were almost at the prior -year level. Investments in in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac4 .6 b illion (prior year: \u20ac4 .5 b illion). Share investments totaled \u20ac177 million versus \u20ac275 million in the prior year.\n\n|                                                   | December 31   | December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| \u20ac in  millions                                    | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Energy Networks                                   | 3,845         | 3,520         |\n| Customer Solutions                                | 831           | 710           |\n| Thereof: Energy Infrastructure Solutions  (\"EIS\") | 523           | 409           |\n| Corporate Functions/Other                         | 69            | 238           |\n| Consolidation                                     | 1             | -4            |\n| Investments in core business                      | 4,746         | 4,464         |\n| Non- Core Business                                | 7             | 298           |\n| E.ON Group investments                            | 4,753         | 4,762         |\n\nInvestments in the core business rose relative to the prior year. Energy Networks' investments of \u20ac3.8 billion were 9 percent above the prior -year figure of \u20ac3.5 billion. Investment activity in all regions focused primarily on new connections and network expansion in conjunction with the energy transition.\n\nCustomer Solutions' investments increased by 17 percent to \u20ac0.8 billion (prior year: \u20ac0.7 billion). Across all its regional markets, the Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') unit alone accounted for \u20ac0.5 of total investments. Key items relative to the prior year were the acquisition of a minority stake in Horisont Energi (a Norway -based company specializing in the production of blue ammonia and in carbonstorage technologies) along with higher investments in E.ON's district -heating networks and in the installation of additional smart energy meters in the United Kingdom.\n\nInvestments at Corporate Functions/Other declined by 71 percent to \u20ac0.1 billion (prior year: \u20ac0.2 billion). The reason is that the prior -year figure includes subsequent purchase -price payments in conjunction with the innogy acquisition.\n\nNonCore Business's investments decreased by \u20ac0.3 billion, because unlike in 2021 no residual power output rights were acquired.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations before interest and taxes of \u20ac11.5 billion was \u20ac5.9 billion above the prior -year level (\u20ac5.6 billion). Energy Networks recorded a significant increase of \u20ac2.3 billion to \u20ac7 billion , in particular because of higher cash -effective earnings and positive changes in working capital at the network business in Germany. Operating cash flow before interest and taxes rose at Customer Solutions as well, increasing by \u20ac1.9 million to \u20ac2.4 billion; the business in the United Kingdom and in Germany contributed to this development. The consequences of the energy -price crisis varied significantly across this segment's individual markets depending on whether government support was provided or not; the consequences in some cases offset each other. Notably, operating cash flow in the United Kingdom was \u20ac1 .3 billion above the prior -year figure. This will lead to correspondingly lower customer payments in subsequent quarters. The shutdown of power plants reduced Non -Core Business's operating cash flow by \u20ac0.8 billion. Corporate Functions/Other's operating cash flow was about \u20ac2.4 billion above the prior -year level, primarily because of internal settlements between E.ON Energy Markets GmbH and the segments due to the central procurement of power and gas. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations benefited from low er interest and tax payments (\u20ac0.1 billion) .\n\nCash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac3.1 billion was \u20ac2.3 billion above the prior -year figure of -\u20ac5.4 billion. This development is primarily attributable to a change in the balance of cash inflows and outflows on commodity futures transactions. Investments and disposals were at the prior -year level. Disposals include in particular a payment inflow from the partial sale of Westconnect GmbH. Activities in Hungary were among those divested in the 2021 finan cial year.",

CCR is equal to operating cash flow before interest and taxes divided by adjusted EBITDA, without factoring in payments for the dismantling of nuclear power stations. E.ON's CCR in 2022 was 151 percent (prior year: 80 percent).",

Noncurrent assets rose by \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac81. 8 billion. This is mainly attributable to an increase in the valu e of companies accounted for using the equity method. Investments in property, plant, and equipment constituted another factor.\n\nCurrent assets increased by 33.5 percent, from \u20ac39.1 billion to \u20ac52.2 billion This resulted mainly from the change in receivables on derivative financial instruments as well as an increase in trade receivables and inventory.\n\nEquity attributable to E.ON SE shareholders was about \u20ac21.9 billion at year-end 2022. Equity attributable to non-controlling interests was roughly \u20ac5.9 billion. The equity ratio (including non -controlling in terests) at year -end 2022 was 16 percent, which is 1 percentage point higher than at year -end 2021. Primarily the remeasurement of pension obligations contributed to this development . Alongside net income, positive effects relating to interest -rate and commodity cash -flow hedges recorded under other comprehensive income were the other main factor.\n\nNoncurrent debt rose by \u20ac13.3 billion, or 21.7 percent, chiefly because of the development of liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments. This was partially offset by a reduction in provisions for pension and a reduction in provisions for nuclear asset -retirement obligations.\n\nCurrent debt of \u20ac37.5 billion was 7.5 percent below the figure at yearend 2021, due principally to a decrease in other provisions for contingent losses from pending transactions because of their utilization following the settlement of the underlying transactions and to a decline in liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments. An increase from trade accounts payable was a countervailing factor.\n\n## Consolidated Assets, Liabilities, and Equity\n\n| \u20ac in millions                | Dec. 31, 2022   |   % | Dec. 31, 2021   |   % |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|-----|-----------------|-----|\n| Non- current assets          | 81,769          |  61 | 80,637          |  67 |\n| Current assets               | 52,240          |  39 | 39,122          |  33 |\n| Total assets                 | 134,009         | 100 | 119,759         | 100 |\n| Equity                       | 21,867          |  16 | 17,889          |  15 |\n| Non- current liabilities     | 74,670          |  56 | 61,359          |  51 |\n| Current liabilities          | 37,472          |  28 | 40,511          |  34 |\n| Total equity and liabilities | 134,009         | 100 | 119,759         | 100 |\n\nThe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more commentary on E.ON's asset situation.",

The main reasons in Germany were the Russia -Ukraine war and the associated conservation of electricity. The significant decline in gas wheeling volume resulted from mild weather as well as the war and the related tense gas situation.\n\nPower wheeling volume in Sweden decreased year on year owing to weather factors as well as the tense situation on energy markets. The same reasons applied at East -Central Europe/Turkey along with the sale of two network operators in Hungary, ETI and \u00c9M\u00c1SZ. Gas wheeling volume was likewise under the prior -year figure due to weather effects and the tense gas and macroeconomic situation amid the war .\n\n## Wheeling Volume\n\n|                                 | Germany   | Germany   |      |      | East - Central Europe/Turkey   | East - Central Europe/Turkey   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Billion  kWh                    | 2022      | 2021      | 2022 | 2021 | 2022                           | 2021                           | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Fourth quarter                  |           |           |      |      |                                |                                |         |         |\n| Power                           | 58.3      | 62.3      | 8.9  | 10.0 | 14.4                           | 15.3                           | 81.6    | 87.6    |\n| Network loss, station use, etc. | 2.0       | 1.9       | 0.2  | 0.4  | 0.8                            | 0.2                            | 3.0     | 2.4     |\n| Gas                             | 43.8      | 54.5      | 0.0  | 0.0  | 12.8                           | 17.6                           | 56.6    | 72.1    |\n| Full year                       |           |           |      |      |                                |                                |         |         |\n| Power                           | 229.6     | 234.7     | 33.7 | 36.9 | 57.0                           | 66.2                           | 320.3   | 337.8   |\n| Network loss, station use, etc. | 7.0       | 7.1       | 1.0  | 1.2  | 3.2                            | 3.9                            | 11.2    | 12.1    |\n| Gas                             | 159.8     | 183.9     | 0.0  | 0.0  | 43.0                           | 49.8                           | 202.8   | 233.7   |\n\n## System Length and Network Customers\n\nE.ON's power system in Germany was about 691,000 kilometers long, slightly below the prior -year figure (700,000 kilometers). At yearend it had about 14.8 million network customers for power in its service territory (prior year: 14.9 million). E.ON's gas system likewise declined slightly to about 98,000 kilometers (prior year: 101,000 kilometers). By contrast, the number of network customers, 1.9 million, was essentially unchanged from 2021.\n\nThe length of E.ON's power system in Sweden was 141,000 kilometers (prior year: 14 0 ,000 kilometers). The number of customers in the power distribution system was about 1.1 million, unchanged from the prior year.\n\nE.ON operates electricity networks in East -Central Europe/Turkey with a total system length of 275,000 kilometers (prior year: 274,000 kilometers) and supplies about 8.4 million network customers (prior year: 8.3 million). As in the prior year, gas networks operated by E.ON were roughly 49,000 kilometers long. The number of gas network customers was unchanged at 2.7 million (prior year: 2.7 million) .",

Sales were thus \u20ac1,587 million above the prior -year figure. The factors contributing to this development included further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments and increased upstream network costs of transmission systems, which, pursuant to statutory regulations, distribution network operators must pass through in their network fees. Adjusted EBITDA improved by \u20ac695 million relative to the prior year. The increase resulted from a variety of effects, including further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments, the leveraging of planned synergies from the innogy transaction, cost savings, and the recovery of adverse earnings effects. These positive effects were partially offset by higher commodity prices and warmer weather.\n\nSales in Sweden of \u20ac1,007 million were slightly above the prior -year figure (\u20ac962 million). Tariff adjustments were the reason for this development. Adjusted EBITDA declined by \u20ac55 million to \u20ac452 million. Earnings were reduced primarily by higher costs for upstream networks, adverse volume effects due in part to mild weather during the year, and higher expenditures for network losses and storm damage.\n\nEast -Central Europe/Turkey's sales of \u20ac3,003 million were higher (prior year: \u20ac2,650 million), whereas adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac854 million was below the prior -year figure (\u20ac1,023 million). The decline in earnings is chiefly attributable to higher procurement c osts for network losses (especially in Romania and Hungary) and the disposal of two network operators in Hungary in the third quarter of 2021. The adverse earnings effect of increased expenditures for network losses is only temporary. Existing regulatory mechanisms enable these expenditures to be recovered by higher earnings in subsequent periods .",

A reliable electricity supply is essential for industrialized countries to be able to maintain their economy and meet their inhabitants' needs. For example, industrial customers that operate high -precision production facilities require a constant network frequency. If frequency fluctuates, machinery can break down, resulting in additional costs. A complete interruption of the electricity supply can have serious consequences, and not just for industrial customers. At companies, government agencies, and households, most processes are no longer possible without electricity. One challenge in power supply is that energy is increasingly being generated decentrally and consequently fed into the E.ON network from many different points. Moreover, renewables feed -in fluctuates because it depends on the weather and other factors beyond E.ON's control.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON wants to operate secure and stable networks in a future energy world as well and thus offer its customers a reliable electricity supply at reasonable costs. That is why E.ON is upgrading to smart grids by equipping networks with sensors and control technology, increasing the level of automation, and adding a digital layer. This will enable us to manage energy flows in line with demand and to monitor our grids in real time and with much greater granularity than today. Additionally, as is described in greater detail below under 'Specific Actions,' smart -grid technology makes it possible for us to avoid or delay some grid expansion.\n\nGoing forward, smart grids will serve as the platform for the innovative technologies and business models that contribute to the energy transition's success. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Flexible tariff models that use price incentives to influence demand and thus help stabilize networks\n- \u00b7 The aggregation of multiple distributed power generating units into virtual power plants that respond dynamically to changes in consumption\n- \u00b7 Peer-topeer sharing solutions, such as for households and businesses\n- \u00b7 Fluctuation -tolerant local energy systems that have battery, gas, or heat storage devices and their own generating units.\n\nWe launched the E.ON Lab in 2022 to study more potential innovations. In Arnsberg/Sundern and L\u00fcneburg, Germany, E.ON is testing the extent to which various aspects of a future energy world are feasible, useful, and scalable. E.ON is expanding its digital equipment in these communities and assessing the value that such smart solutions add for customers and networks. We are also exploring whether and how current energy -market regulation can better reflect customer needs. E.ON's smart solutions promote secure and efficient network operation. This gives us a transparent view of the operating status of network equipment and energy flows and enables us to make targeted use of the flexibility available in our networks.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nIn 2021 E.ON adopted a strategy for deploying more smart t echnology (smartification) in its low -and medium -voltage grids. The strategy applies in Germany and all other countries in Europe where the Company operates. E.ON's smart -tech deployment targets vary by country but generally far exceed those set by each c ountry's regulatory scheme. We monitor progress using k ey p erformance i ndicators ('KPIs') on a regular basis.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON's regional network companies are responsible for the safe and reliable operation of its distribution networks. Network control centers manage network operations. They are also responsible for resolving unforeseeable outages in their service territory. E.ON's crisis management system defines the responsibilities and procedures for dealing with widespread disruptions. The Incident and Crisis Management policy provides guidelines for such situations. The Chief Operating Officer -Networks ('COO -N') oversees the Energy Networks segment. Under his leadership, three departments (Energy Networks Europe, Energy Networks G ermany, and Energy Networks Technology & Innovation) at Corporate Functions manage the segment's regional units. These departments' tasks include strategic development, investment planning, and asset management.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON has an investment and maintenance programs under which it expands and maintains its networks in line with demand. E.ON will invest \u20ac26 billion in network expansion from 2023 to 2027. This is intended to enable us to ensure that all our network customers are connected to the network and receive a reliable energy supply. Our regional network companies are responsible for carrying out the measures, which are planned for one or more years. Part of the investment budget goes toward the gradual expansion of smart grids: E.ON's network structure is being progressively equipped with sensors, control and relay technology as well as being automated and digitally networked. The increasing use of smart -grid technology makes it possible to avoid or delay costly investments in network expansion, for example, by using new technology to making better use of existing overhead lines. Investment decisions always consider the efficiency of each measure alongside security of supply. This means that E.ON chooses those solutions that make the most sense from both a technical and business standpoint. This is because network investments also affect network fees, which account for a portion of the electricity price paid by customers.",

The data collected are aggregated into the system average interruption duration index ('SAIDI') for electricity. It indicates the average interruption duration per customer and yea r.\n\nE.ON reports the SAIDI of its fully consolidated network companies by country. The figures for Germany reflect the weighted average of its fully consolidated network companies there. They are calculated using the method prescribed by the Federal Network Agency (known by its German acronym, 'BNetzA'). The calculations are based on service interruptions that have been verified by the BNetzA. All other countries in which E.ON operates networks have similar quality standards. Their national regulatory agenc ies verify and validate network operators' outage reports. The SAIDI figures for each country therefore reflect the methodology prescribed by its regulatory agency.\n\n\u203a Our network companies also calculate the system average interruption frequency index ('SAIFI'). This measures the average number of interruptions per customer and year. The data collection process for SAIFI is the same as for SAIDI. \u2039\n\nBy the end of the data collection period in 2022, no regulatory agency had completed the process of validating outages for 2022. This report is intended to contain final figures on the continuity of supply that have been officially validated. Consequently, the countryspecific figures for the prior year are disclosed below.\n\nAlthough E.ON's does not use SAIDI and SAIFI for management control purposes, these figures provide important information on network reliability. At regular intervals, our network operators inform the E.ON Management Board member responsible for network operations about their supply r eliability.\n\nThe following presentation of key figures on service quality considers different causes when classifying disruption -related interruptions in individual countries because their respective national regulatory agencies use different methodologies .\n\n## SAIDI Power 1 G4-EU29\n\n|                       | 2022      | 2022            | 2022   | 2021      | 2021            | 2021   | 2020      | 2020            | 2020   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|\n| Minutes per  customer | Scheduled | Unsched -  uled | Total  | Scheduled | Unsched -  uled | Total  | Scheduled | Unsched -  uled | Total  |\n| Germany 2             | 7         | 16              | 24     | 7         | 15              | 22     | 7         | 16              | 23     |\n| Sweden                | 30        | 91              | 121    | 26        | 91              | 116    | 25        | 121             | 146    |\n| Hungary 3             | 87        | 54              | 141    | 117       | 58              | 175    | 117       | 61              | 178    |\n| Czech Republic 4      | 144       | 308             | 451    | 134       | 47              | 181    | 145       | 47              | 192    |\n| Romania               | 293       | 89              | 382    | 297       | 259             | 556    | 288       | 358             | 646    |\n| Slovakia 4            | 80        | 66              | 146    | 70        | 58              | 128    | 143       | 65              | 208    |\n| Poland 3              | 11        | 39              | 50     | 7         | 38              | 45     | 9         | 44              | 53     |\n\nThe positive trend in service reliability in Germany continued in 2022 (based on data from 2021). A similar development can be observed in Poland and Sweden. The significant reduction in unplanned service interruptions in Romania is attributable to extensive investments in technological upgrades and maintenance. The improvement in Hungary is due to the sale of distribution system operators ('DSOs') ETI and EM\u00c1SZ. E.ON's networks in Germany have the Group's best service reliability. The exceptionally high unscheduled outages in the Czech Republic are related to a tornado in southern Moravia that left several dead and hundreds injured, as well as causing severe damage in the region.",

Gas sales of 462.9 billion kWh were slightly above the prior -year figure of 448 billion kWh. The wholesale market business was responsible for the slight increase, which resulted primarily from the optimization of the procurement portfolio.\n\nPower and gas sales to the customer groups decreased. The primary reasons for the decline in power and gas sales in almost all of E.ON's regional markets were portfolio streamlining in line with our B2B strategy, mild weather as well as crisis -related energy conservation and the associated decline in consumption .\n\n## Power Sales\n\n|                      | Germany   | Germany   | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   | The Netherlands   | The Netherlands   | Other   | Other   | Total   | Total   |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Billion kWh          | 2022      | 2021      | 2022             | 2021             | 2022              | 2021              | 2022    | 2021    | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Fourth quarter       |           |           |                  |                  |                   |                   |         |         |         |         |\n| Residential a nd SME | 9.0       | 8.8       | 4.6              | 6.0              | 1.7               | 1.7               | 6.0     | 8.2     | 21.4    | 24.7    |\n| I&C                  | 7.2       | 6.9       | 5.7              | 8.7              | 0.6               | 1.1               | 4.7     | 6.1     | 18.4    | 22.8    |\n| Sales partners       | 4.9       | 13.4      | 0.8              | -

In the United Kingdom the number of customers declined slightly to 9.1 million because of the challenging market conditions (prior year: 9.3 million). This was also the reason why the number of customers in the Netherlands decreased slightly to 4 million (prior year: 4. 1 million). The total number of customers in the other regions declined from 11 million to 8.4 million. Customer losses are attributable almost exclusively to power customers in Hungary due to the return of the ELM\u00dc universal service provider ('USP') license and the resulting restructuring of the business. Customer losses relate to both power and gas customers .\n\n## Sales and Adjusted EBIT DA\n\nThe \u20ac34.8 billion increase in Customer Solutions' sales to \u20ac96.2 billion mainly reflects price increases on commodity markets during the energy crisis and impacted, in particular, the sales business in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands . Adjusted EBITDA increased by \u20ac193 million to \u20ac1,686 million. Distributed energy i nfrastructure solutions ('EIS') for customers account for a significant portion of Customer Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA of these activities totaled \u20ac568 million in the year under review.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in Germany rose by \u20ac66 million to \u20ac760 million. The main reasons were lower acquisition costs due to less customer churn as well as the leveraging of synergies in the wake of the innogy integration. 6 On balance, the adjustment of end -customer prices offset increased procurement costs as well as the costs for anticipated payment defaults due to the passthrough of high energy prices.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the United Kingdom decreased by \u20ac53 million to \u20ac208 million. The decline resulted mainly from weather and consumption effects as well as precautionary measures for payment defaults, especially in the business with residential customers and small and medium -sized enterprises. These items were only partially offset by cost savings delivered by the ongoing restructuring program.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Netherlands rose by \u20ac 172 million to \u20ac 324 million. Positive weather effects and the dynamic procurement strategy including the optimized use of gas storage facilities made a significant contribution to this positive earnings performance.\n\nThe other regions generally delivered a positive sales and adjusted EBITDA performance as well. Sales increased by \u20ac4,556 million to \u20ac15,315 million and adjusted EBITDA by \u20ac8 million to \u20ac394 million. The sale of the regulated retail business had a particularly positive effect on earnings in Hungary, whereas the regulatory scheme had an adverse impact in Romania .\n\n| Customer Solutions   |         |         |                |                |                 |                 |        |        |        |        |             |             |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n|                      | Germany | Germany | United Kingdom | United Kingdom | The Netherlands | The Netherlands | Other  | Other  | Total  | Total  | Thereof EIS | Thereof EIS |\n| \u20ac in millions        | 2022    | 2021    | 2022           | 2021           | 2022            | 2021            | 2022   | 2021   | 2022   | 2021   | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Fourth quarter       |         |         |                |                |                 |                 |        |        |        |        |             |             |\n| Sales                | 11,974  | 11,564  | 12,789         | 6,392          | 3,591           | 1,730           | 4,609  | 3,523  | 32,963 | 23,209 | -           | -           |\n| Adjusted EBITDA      | 285     | 161     | -302           | -35            | 115             | 50              | 171    | -5     | 269    | 171    | 203         | 170         |\n| Full year            |         |         |                |                |                 |                 |        |        |        |        |             |             |\n| Sales                | 38,732  | 28,711  | 31,992         | 17,870         | 10,182          | 4,088           | 15,315 | 10,759 | 96,221 | 61,428 | -           | -           |\n| Adjusted EBITDA      | 760     | 694     | 208            | 261            | 324             | 152             | 394    | 386    | 1,686  | 1,493  | 568         | 479         |\n\n6 Cash -effective costs of \u20ac105 million were recorded in 2022 for innogy's integration into the E.ON Group.",

Energy efficiency and other methods of reducing consumption as well as energy recovery can lower emissions too. E.ON has a broad portfolio of such solutions, which it markets to residential customers and to industrial, commercial, and municipal customers. E.ON continually adjusts this portfolio to better meet its customers' needs, respond to market changes, and utilize new technologies.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON offers distributed energy systems for households under the brand name Future Energy Home. Customers can use a variety of solutions: solar modules for generating their own energy and battery systems for storing it as well as charging stations for electric vehicles ('EVs'), heat pumps, and other heating solutions. The devices are connected to E.ON Home, an energy -management app; launched in 2018, it was available in six countries in the year under review. Three more countries a re to be added in 2023. Regardless of where they are, customers can use the app to view their home's energy output and consumption, control their devices, and reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. E.ON added new functions to the app in 2022, particularly for e lectromobility ('eMobility'). More solutions are being tested, such as solar charging.\n\nFor digital energy -management solutions to function seamlessly, smart energy meters are essential. An EU Directive from 2009 stipulates that, to the degree technically and financially feasible, all customers should have a smart energy meter. Member states must transpose this directive into national law. Germany's Act on the Digitalization of the Energy Transition of 2016, for example, specifies that all customers must be equipped with a smart energy meter by 2032. More information can be found below under 'Goals and Performance Review.'\n\nAlso eMobility will play a significant role in the energy transition. Germany's transport sector emitted around 148 million me tric tons of CO\u2082 equivalents (' CO2e ') in 2021. The German Climate Protection Act, which was amended in 2021, calls for these emissions to be reduced to a maximum of 85 million metric tons of CO2 e per year by 2030. To achieve this, passenger car and road freight transport must be climate -neutral and the range of alternative drive trains and the infrastructure to supply them with energy must be massively expanded. One million publicly accessible charging points are to be installed in Germany alone by 2030. In addition, there will be charging points in e C ar drivers' private and business environments and at the premises of EV fleet operators. E.ON's objective is to use its experience in the energy sector to simplify EV charging in public places, at work, and at home.\n\nE.ON offers comprehensive infrastructure solutions to make charging both economical and climate -friendly. Under its E.ON Drive brand, E.ON plans and installs charging stations and connects them to the power grid. E.ON is also responsible for supplying energy and operating the equipment. We further optimized our eMobility business in the year under review and will concentrate on three areas in the future: E.ON Drive Solutions serves private and business users. Its focus is on offerings for charging at work, on the go, and at home, which include a variety of wall -mounted charging stations as well as related installation and energy services. In addition, E.ON Drive eTransport is engaged in the electrification of commercial vehicles. E.ON Drive Infrastructure is responsible for charging in public places.\n\nDistributed, flexible, and connected supply systems are crucial for the future energy world. E.ON wants to propel their development with Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS'). It consists of two units, City Energy Solutions ('CES') and Business -toBusiness ('B2B'), which develop, own, and operate distributed energy infrastructure. EIS aims to help commercial, industrial, municipal, and real estate customers achieve their sustainability goals. The relevant assets are installed at customers' premises or in their\n\nvicinity. EIS specializes in four areas: comprehensive embedded generation solutions for electricity, heat, and steam as well as the supply of district heating and cooling. Its portfolio also includes distributed solutions for city districts and industrial and commercial customers as well as products and services for greater energy efficiency. EIS's offerings incorporate the latest technology, including combined -heat -andpower ('CHP') and energy -reco very plants as well as waste -heat recovery and low -temperature heating and cooling networks. Some solutions are complemented by software -based solutions and analytics that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions by visualizing and optimizing their energy use.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer -Commercial, who is a member of the E.ON Management Board, has overall responsibility for the entire customer business, including the Customer Solutions segment. The segment also includes concepts that enable customers to create social, environmental, and financial value. E.ON Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') and Business -toCustomer ('B2C') work with various E.ON business units on a wide range of topics, such as product development, plant operation, and sustainability management. Responsibility for this lies with the regional units for their respective market (including Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia).\n\nE.ON's distribution system operators ('DSOs') across Europe, which are part of the Energy Networks segment, are responsible for installing smart energy meters in their service territories; the exception is the United Kingdom, where E.ON's retail organization provides them to its customers. German law created two roles for the provision of smart energy meters. The first role, the default metering provider, is responsible for the mass rollout of the standard smart energy meter mandated by German law. At E.ON, this role is performed by its DSOs. The second role, the competitive metering service provider, offers the standard smart energy meter as well as other metering solutions. At E.ON, this role is performed by its German retail sales unit. In addition, E.ON",

E.ON Drive Solutions is represented across Europe, and its task areas include sales, operations, and IT management.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON Plus enables residential customers in Germany to bundle two or more energy contracts for power or gas and to benefit from 100 percent green power at no extra charge. By meeting certain conditions, they can receive an annual discount of \u20ac60 per contract. E.ON contracts throughout Germany are eligible. Moreover, customers can bundle their own contracts or participate in E.ON Plus with family members, friends, or neighbors. E.ON Plus electricity is certified green by T\u00dcV S\u00fcd.\n\nAs an eMobility provider ('EMP'), we give e C ar drivers access to our charging network. This network also includes charging points from other providers that are available to E.ON customers as roaming options. In addition, we offer residential customers innovative charging stations and specific electricity tariffs. We supply our commercial customers with both regular and fast charging stations. Furthermore, we support them with solutions for EV fleet management.\n\nIn addition, since 2018 E.ON has been a member of the Climate Group's global EV100 initiative, which aims to make EVs the new normal by 2030. To lead the way, E.ON is gradually electrifying its vehicle fleet and car parks for employees, guests, and customers. For more information about EV100, visit the Environmental Management chapter.\n\nOn the commercial vehicle side, E.ON Drive aims to capitalize on growth in the market segments of electric road haulage and public passenger transport as well. Battery -powered commercial vehicles\n\nare still the exception, especially in the heavy -duty category. Unlike the passenger car market, the transportation sector is only at the beginning of its evolution toward zero -emissions mobility. But interest among companies and municipalities in electrifying their truck, bus, and van fleets is growing. Climate targets, increasing freight transport, and the growth trajectory of electric drives in local and long -distance public transport will pose greater challenges for charging infrastructure, land use, and grid connections as well. E.ON wants to help fleet operators meet these challenges by significantly expanding its portfolio of products and services for charging fleets of electric commercial vehicles. We want to expand E.ON Drive eTransport, which provides charging solutions for commercial vehicles, to become on e of the leading offerings in Europe by 2025.\n\nEIS pursues a partnership -based business approach both in its B2B unit and in CES' s products for business customers and municipalities. It develops integrated solutions for heating, cooling, electricity, and mobility. These holistic concepts that integrate the individual sectors; for example, electricity from photovoltaic systems can be used to power heat pumps and eMobility charging infrastructure. E.ON enters into long -term partnerships, such as the cooperation agreement it signed with Deutsche ErdW\u00e4rme GmbH ('DEW') in 2022. Together, we want to develop and implement geothermal projects to provide our business customers with green, regionally generated heat.\n\nCES customers increasingly link their sustainability targets to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (' UN SDGs'), especially SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). CES formed partnerships with municipal and real estate customers across Europe in 2022 to support them in achieving their sustainability targets. By assisting them with development projects that have longlasting effects, we also aim to help safeguard their assets' longterm value.\n\nE.ON continues to take part in research projects at universities and research institutions. The purpose is to develop the technologies, systems, and approaches that will make it possible to meet the needs of tomorrow's energy world. Our flagship partnership is with the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen University. Its research has an interdisciplinary approach and focuses mainly on distributed generation, smart grids, and efficient building technologies.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON wants to offer its customers pioneering energy solutions for the energy world of today and tomorrow. We want our solutions to help them save money, use less energy where possible, and emit less carbon dioxide. E.ON has set a target for this: by 2030, the Company aims to reduce customers' carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent relative to 2016 (you can find out more about E.ON's climate targets in the Climate Protection chapter).\n\nE.ON's goal is to equip all its customers with a smart energy meter in the markets covered by the EU directive. However, regulatory delays in the certification of the communication units, known as smart energy meter gateways, prevented DSOs in Germany from starting to gradually rollout smart energy metering systems until February 2020. Until the responsible federal authority withdrew the market declaration in May 2022, the rollout of smart energy metering systems in Germany proceeded according to plan. Sinc e then, it has continued on a reduced scale. A renewed ramp -up requires a legal change, which E.ON expects in 2023.\n\nThe E.ON Drive Infrastructure team invests in, builds, and operates charging infrastructure at publicly accessible locations to support the development of a Europe -wide network. It aims to expand its network by 1,000 charging points per year and is focusing on three key use cases to achieve this target:\n\n- \u00b7 in the immediate vicinity of densely populated residential areas, city centers, and attractions",

These KPIs range from carbonemissio n s savings to reductions in energy costs and consumption including reductions in final energy consumption (such as electricity) as well as primary energy usage (for example, fuel consumption to generate electricity or heat). Due to country -specific standards and reporting obligations, however, these KPIs are not consistently consolidated Group -wide.\n\nDepending on the project and customer requirements, we also use a variety of KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness of CES solutions for customers. These KPIs include primary energy consumption (such as the use of gas to generate heat), avoided emissions (typically CO2 ), and the deployment of renewable generation technologies (such as geothermal energy and heat pumps) in new property developments. Targets differ based on customer demands and market standards. Teams from our regional units monitor these projects on a regular basis.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Installed Smart Energy Meters by Country\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Thousand units    | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rollout countries |        |        |        |\n| United Kingdom    | 5,300  | 4,738  | 4,208  |\n| Germany 1         | 4,874  | 3,112  | 2,540  |\n| Sweden            | 1,050  | 1,047  | 1,044  |\n| Pilot countries   |        |        |        |\n| Romania           | 346    | 306    | 288    |\n| Slovakia          | 105    | 100    | 231    |\n| Hungary           | 330    | 188    | 142    |\n| Czech  Republic   | 10     | 5      | 2      |\n| Poland            | 163    | 158    | 0      |\n| Total             | 12,178 | 9,654  | 8,455  |\n\n1 Includes digital meters.",

Adjusted EBITDA fell as well, by \u20ac533 million to \u20ac1,084 million.\n\nThe year -onyear reduction in sales at PreussenElektra resulted mainly from the fact that Brokdorf and Grohnde NPPs were shut down as planned on December 31, 2021. This was partially offset by higher sales prices on power marketed from Isar 2 NPP. The decline in adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the non -recurrence of the one -off effect recorded in 2021 in co njunction with the agreement between the German federal government and NPP operators on nuclear power output rights and the resulting refund of residual power purchases.\n\nBrokdorf and Grohnde NPPs as planned on December 31, 2021, was another factor. This was partially offset by higher sales prices relative to the prior year. The provisions of the Act on the Introduction of an Electricity Price Cap and the amendment of other energy laws (such as 'StromBP') to tax windfall electricity market profits (which apply from December 1, 2022, onward) adversely impacted earnings for the first time .\n\nAt the power generation business in Turkey, by contrast, equity earnings on E.ON's stake in Enerjisa \u00dcretim surpassed the prior -year figure, primarily because of operating improvements, which were partially offset by currency -translation effects resulting from the weakening of the Turkish lira .\n\n## Non-Core Business\n\n|                 | PreussenElektra   | PreussenElektra   | Generation in Turkey   | Generation in Turkey   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| \u20ac in  millions  | 2022              | 2021              | 2022                   | 2021                   | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Fourth quarter  |                   |                   |                        |                        |         |         |\n| Sales           | 308               | 559               | -                      | -                      | 308     | 559     |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 277               | 346               | 29                     | 20                     | 306     | 366     |\n| Full year       |                   |                   |                        |                        |         |         |\n| Sales           | 1,060             | 1,632             | -                      | -                      | 1,060   | 1,632   |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 922               | 1,563             | 162                    | 54                     | 1,084   | 1,617   |",

The increase in receivables from\n\naffiliated companies and the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies mainly reflected changes in cash -pooling balances.\n\nThe increase in other receivables results mainly from the acquisition of money market funds; the decline in other liabilities results mainly from the repayment of short -term financial liabilities and from a reduction in liabilities relating to other taxes.\n\nThe change in equity reflects changes in treasury shares under the employee stock -purchase program conducted in 2022 along with a \u20ac2 71 million increase in net income available for distribution.\n\nThe increase in provisions mainly results from the provision for recultivation and remediation obligations.\n\nE.ON SE issued new bonds and commercial paper in the amount of \u20ac3,85 2 million in the 2022 financial year and repaid bonds in the amount of \u20ac1,250 million.

As such, its earnings situation is affected by income from equity interests. The main contributors to positive income from equity interests were income from the transfer of profits from E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH in the amount of \u20ac1,333 million, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH in the amount of \u20ac984 million, and E.ON Energie AG in the amount of \u20ac501 million.\n\nThe financial result for 2022 includes expenses from impairment charges on equity interests in affiliated companies and a deterioration in net interest expense, mainly due to the increase in interest rates.\n\nThe negative balance of other income and expenses in 2022 resulted primarily from \u20ac221 million in expenses for purchased third -party services, \u20ac215 million in personnel -related expenses, \u20ac60 million in auditing and consulting services, and \u20ac14 million in net expenses from currency effects. In addition, \u20ac109 million of the expenses reflect the increase in the provision for recultivation and remediation obligations. The prior -year figure included income of \u20ac368 million relat ing to the reversal of impairment charges on equity interests in affiliated companies.\n\nThe activities of the company E.ON SE within the meaning of Section 6b (3) of the Energy Industry Act consist mainly of other activities outside the electricity and gas sector. In addition, E.ON SE provides a relatively limited degree of energy -specific services to affiliated network operators for network operations relating to electricity distribution and/or gas distribution and prepares activity statements for these services. The resulting earnings, individually and in total, are minimal (about -\u20ac1 million).\n\nIn the year under review, total income from taxes amounted to \u20ac106 million relating to taxes for prior years. This consists of an income tax income of \u20ac118 million and an expense from other taxes of \u20ac 1 2 million.",

This also applies to dividend growth of up to 5 percent for the 2023 financial year. E.ON will aim for an annual increase in dividend per share after 202 7 as well. In E.ON's strategy, sustainability with an emphasis on climate -neutral economic activities is a key growth factor that will enable E.ON to meet its dividend targets.",

Persistently high inflation spread across countries and products. In addition, the Russia -Ukraine war increases the risk of a debt crisis in low -in come countries. In view of this situation, the OECD's November 2022 economic outlook projects global economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2023 and 2.7 percent in 2024. Emerging economies in Asia will account for almost three quarters of global growth in 2023, whereas the upswing in the United States and Europe will lose momentum. Furthermore, inflation rates are expected to remain at a high level in 2023.\n\nThe European Union's autumn economic forecast assumes that GDP growth is likely to reach 0.3 percent in 2023 in both the EU and the eurozone. It predicts economic growth averaging 1.6 percent in 2024 in the EU and 1.5 percent in the eurozone. At the same time, the inflation rate is expected to decline in 2023 but remain high at 7 percent in the EU and 6.1 percent in the eurozone, before easing to 3 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, in 2024.\n\nThe German Council of Economic Experts had forecast as recently as the spring of 2022 that Germany would achieve GDP growth of 3.6 percent in 2023. It corrected its prediction in the fall of 2022 and now expects GDP to decline by 0.2 percent in 2023. The OECD published a similar forecast. It assumes that Germany will record negative economic growth of 0.3 percent. By contrast, it expects GDP to recover by 1. 5 percent in 2024. This will require that foreign demand picks up as anticipated, pressure on energy prices decreases, and the inflation rate declines.\n\n## General Statement on E.ON's Anticipated Development\n\nThe growth strategy adopted in 2021 as a continuation of the Group's far -reaching transformation in the preceding years proved to be correct and resilient even in the crisis year 2022. In our view, the strategic elements of sustainability and digitalization, which remain valid and underscore E.ON 's growth ambitions, are precisely the success factors that will accelerate the transformation of the energy system. We anticipate that in 2023 our operating business will continue to be shaped by the high level of inflation and interests rates as well as volatile and higher wholesale energy prices than before the start of the crisis. Policy and regulatory measures will have an indirect and direct impact on our business operations in individual countries. However, they are now more concrete than in the previous year. The forecast therefore includes the impact of the energy crisis to the extent that we can estimate macroeconomic factors and regulatory intervention .\n\n## Anticipated Earnings and Financial Situation\n\n## Forecast Earnings Performance\n\nThe most important key performance indicators for managing the E.ON Group are adjusted EBITDA, investments, and earnings per share from adjusted net income ('EPS'). E.ON expects adjusted Group EBITDA of \u20ac7.8 to 8.0 billion in the 2023 financial year. It anticipates adjusted net income of \u20ac2. 3 to 2.5 billion, or \u20ac0.8 8 to \u20ac0.96 per share in 2023 (based on around 2,610 million shares outstanding). We report on the E.ON Group's dividend policy and planned annual dividend growth in the 'E.ON on Capital Markets' chapter .\n\n## Forecast by segment:\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA 1 : 2023 Plan\n\n|                           | \u20ac in billions   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Energy Networks           | 6.0 to 6.2      |\n| Customer Solutions        | 1.8 to 2.0      |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | circa -0.1      |\n| E.ON Group                | 7.8 to 8.0      |\n\n1 Adjusted for non -operating effects.\n\nE.ON expects Energy Networks to record a significant earnings increase in 2023 compared with the past financial year. This performance will result from further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments. In addition, lower adverse effects from the procurement of loss energy compared with the previous year and catch -up effects from previous years are expected.\n\nEarnings at Customer Solutions are expected to be above the prioryear level. The Company expects a positive performance, partic ularly in the United Kingdom, as a result of successful restructuring and a more stable market environment compared with the prior year. In addition, this segment will benefit from further growth in distributed EIS activities.\n\nEarnings at Corporate Functions/Other are expected to be above the prior -year level. The earnings streams from generation activities in Turkey, which are reported under Corporate Functions/Other effective the start of the 2023 financial year, will have a positive impact.\n\nAdjusted net income and earnings per share from adjusted net income ('EPS') are expected to be below the prior -year level. In addition to the above -described developments in adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation charges due to increased investments in the",

Investments of around \u20ac5.8 billion are therefore planned for the 2023 financial year .\n\n## Cash-Effective Investments: 2023 Plan\n\n|                           | \u20ac in billions   |   Percentages |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Energy Networks           | ~4.6            |            79 |\n| Customer Solutions        | ~1.1            |            19 |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | ~0.1            |             2 |\n| E.ON Group                | ~5.8            |           100 |\n\nE .ON will make most of these investments in its Energy Networks segment, the backbone of a successful energy transition. Investments will go toward expanding, enhancing, and modernizing networks, switching equipment, and metering and control technology in order to ensure the reliable, uninterrupted, and sustainable distribution of electricity and to meet rising energy demand. In addition, E.ON will invest in the digitalization of network planning, monitoring, and control.\n\nCustomer Solutions' investments will largely be channeled into the expansion of the EIS business of providing climate -friendly, distributed energy infrastructure solutions, particularly in our markets in Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. E.ON will also invest in advanced IT platforms, smart energy meters (primarily in the United Kingdom), smart charging solutions for eMobility, and integrated energy solutions.\n\nCorporate Functions/Other's investments will go mainly toward Groupwide IT infrastructure and digital platforms for the networks and customer solutions business .",

It provides:\n\n- \u00b7 meaningful information about risks and chances to the business, thereby enabling the business to derive individual risks/chances as well as aggregate risk profiles within the time horizon of the medium -term plan\n- \u00b7 transparency on E.ON's risk position in compliance with legal requirements including KonTraG, BilMoG, and BilReG .\n\nThe ERM is based on a centralized governance approach that defines standardized processes and tools covering the identification, evaluation, countermeasures, monitoring, and reporting of risks and chances. Overall governance is provided by the Group Controlling & Risk division's Group Risk department on behalf of the E.ON SE Risk Committee.\n\nAll risks and chances have an accountable member of the Management Board, have a designated risk owner who remains operationally responsible for managing that risk/chance, and are identified in a dedica ted bottom -up process.\n\n## Scope\n\nE.ON's risk management system in the broader sense has a total of four components:\n\n- \u00b7 an internal monitoring system\n- \u00b7 a management information system\n- \u00b7 preventive measures\n- \u00b7 the ERM, which is a risk management system in the narrow sense .\n\nThe purpose of the internal monitoring system is to ensure the proper functioning of business processes. It consists of preventive organizational measures (such as policies and work instructions) and internal controls and audits (particularly by Internal Audit).\n\nThe E.ON internal management information system identifies risks early so that steps can be taken to actively address them. Close consultation between the business units and with departments at Corporate Functions such as Controlling, Finance, and Accounting as well as Internal Audit is of particular importance in early risk detection.",

Furthermore, the Company strives to conduct proper project management so as to identify early and minimize the risks attending major investments.\n\nE.ON attempts to minimize the operational risks of legal proceedings and ongoing planning processes by managing them appropriately and by designing appropriate contracts beforehand.\n\n## Managing Operational and IT Risks\n\nTo limit operational and IT risks, E.ON continually improves its network management and the optimal dispatch of its assets. At the same time, E.ON implements operational and infrastructure improvements that will enhance the reliability of its generation assets and distribution networks, even under extraordinarily adverse conditions. In addition, E.ON has factored the operational and financial effects of environmental risks into its emergency plan. They are part of a catalog of crisis and system -failure scenarios prepared for the Group by the Incident and Crisis Management team.\n\nE.ON IT systems are maintained and optimized by qualified E.ON Group experts and outside experts and by a wide range of technological security measures. In addition, the E.ON Group has in place a range of technological and organizational measures to counter the risk of unauthorized access to data, the misuse of data, and data loss.\n\n## Managing Health, Safety, and Environmental ('HSE'), Human Resources ('HR'), and Other Risks\n\nThe following are among the comprehensive measures E.ON takes to address such risks ( including in conjunction with operational and IT risks):\n\n- \u00b7 systematic employee training, advanced training, and qualification programs for employees\n- \u00b7 further refinement of production procedures, processes, and technologies\n- \u00b7 regular facility and network maintenance and inspection\n- \u00b7 company guidelines as well as work and process instructions\n- \u00b7 quality management, control, and assurance\n- \u00b7 project, environmental, and deterioration management\n- \u00b7 crisis -prevention measures and emergency planning\n- \u00b7 management systems for health, safety, and environmental protection certified to ISO standards; in some cases, technical safety management ('TSM') as well\n- \u00b7 defined continual improvement processes ('CIPs') .\n\nShould an accident occur despite the measures taken, E.ON has a reasonable level of insurance coverage. Detailed information can be found in various chapters of the Combined Group Management Report.\n\n## Managing Market Risks\n\nE.ON uses a comprehensive sales -management system and extensive customer management to manage margin risks caused by market prices. E.ON conducts systematic risk management to limit exposure to risks of price changes . Its key elements are, in addition to binding Groupwide policies and a Group -wide reporting system, the use of quantitative key figures, the limitation of risks, and the strict separation of functions between departments. Furthermore, E.ON utilizes derivative financial in struments that are commonly used in the marketplace. These instruments are transacted with financial institutions, brokers, power exchanges, and third parties whose creditworthiness is monitored on an ongoing basis. E.ON's local sales units and the remaining generation operations conduct local risk management under central governance standards to monitor these underlying commodity risks and to minimize them through hedging.\n\n## Managing Strategic Risks\n\nE.ON has comprehensive preventive measures in place to mana ge potential risks relating to acquisitions and investments. These measures include, in addition to the relevant company guidelines and manuals, comprehensive due diligence, legally binding contracts, a multistage approvals process, and shareholding and pr oject controlling. Comprehensive post -acquisition projects also contribute to successful integration.\n\n## Managing Finance and Treasury Risks\n\nThis category encompasses credit, interest -rate, currency, tax, and asset -management risks and chances. E.ON uses systematic risk management to monitor and control its interest -rate and currency risks and manage these risks using derivative and non -derivative financial instruments. Here, E.ON SE plays a central role by aggregating risk positions through intragroup transactions and hedging these risks in the market. Due to E.ON SE's intermediary role, its risk position is largely closed.",

E.ON manages credit risk by taking appropriate measures, which include obtaining collateral and setting limits. The E.ON Group's Risk Committee is regularly informed about credit risks. A further component of E.ON's risk management is a conservative investment strategy for financial funds and a broadly diversified portfolio.\n\nNote 31  to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains detailed information about the use of derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions. Note 32  describes the general principles of E.ON's risk management and applicable risk metrics for quantifying risks relating to commodities, credit, liquidity, interest rates, and currency translation.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM')\n\nE.ON's ERM, which is the basis for the risks and chances described in the next section, encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 systematic risk and chance identification\n- \u00b7 risk and chance analysis and evaluation\n- \u00b7 management and monitoring of risks and chances by analyzing and evaluating countermeasures and preventive systems\n- \u00b7 documentation and reporting.\n\nAs required by law, E.ON's ERM's effectiveness is reviewed regularly by Internal Audit. In compliance with the provisions of Section 91, Paragraph 2, of the German Stock Corporation Act relating to the establishment of a risk -monitoring and early warning system, E.ON has a Risk Committee for the E.ON Group and for each of its business units. The Risk Committee's mission is to achieve a comprehensive overview of E.ON's risk exposure at\n\nthe Group and unit level and to actively manage risk exposure in line with E.ON's risk strategy.\n\nThe ERM applies to all fully consolidated E.ON Group companies and all companies valued at equity whose gross book value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is greater than \u20ac50 million. E.ON takes an inventory of its risks and chances at each quarterly balancesheet date.\n\nTo promote uniform financial reporting Group -wide, E.ON has in place a central, standardized system that enables effective and automated risk reporting. Company data are systematically collected, transparently processed, and made available for analysis both centrally and decentrally at the units.\n\n## Risks and Chances\n\n## Methodology\n\nE.ON's IT -based system for reporting risks and chances has the following risk categories:\n\n| Risk Category               | Examples                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Legal and regulatory risks  | Policy and legal risks and chances, regulatory risks, risks from public consent processes                      |\n| Operational and IT risks    | IT and process risks and chances,  risks and chances relating to asset operations and new - build projects     |\n| HSE, HR, and other          | Health, safety, and environmental  risks                                                                       |\n| Market risks                | Risks and chances from the  development of commodity prices  and margins and from changes in  market liquidity |\n| Strategic risks             | Risks and chances from investments and disposals                                                               |\n| Finance and treasury  risks | Credit, interest - rate, foreign - currency, tax, and asset - management risks and chances                     |",

Risks and chances are generally reported on the basis of objective evaluations. If this is not possible, estimates by inhouse experts are used. The evaluation measures a risk's/chance's financial impact on the current earnings plan while factoring in risk -reducing countermeasures. The evaluation therefore reflects the net risk.\n\nFor quantifiable risks and chances, E.ON then evaluates the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss or damage. In the commodity business, for example, commodity prices can rise or fall. This type of risk is modeled with a normal distribution. Modeling is supported by a Groupwide IT -based system. Extremely unlikely events -those whose likelihood of occurrence is 5 percent or less -are classified as tail events. Tail events are not included in the simulation described below.\n\nThis statistical distribution makes it possible for E.ON's internal risk management system to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of these risks. This yields an aggregated risk distribution that is quantified as the deviation from the Company's current earnings plan for adjusted EBITDA.\n\nE.ON uses the 5th and 95th percentiles of this aggregated risk distribution as the worst case and best case, respectively. Statistically, this means that with this risk distribution there is a 90 percent likelihood that the deviation from the Company's current earnings plan for adjusted EBITDA will remain within these extremes.\n\n| Impact Classes Low   | x < \u20ac50 million                  |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Moderate             | \u20ac50 million \u2264 x < \u20ac200 million   |\n| Medium               | \u20ac200 million \u2264 x < \u20ac500  million |\n| Material             | \u20ac500 million \u2264 x < \u20ac2 billion    |\n| High                 | x \u2265 \u20ac2 billion                   |\n\nThe last step is to assign, in accordance with the 5th and 95th percentiles, the aggregated risk distribution to impact classes -low, moderate, medium, major, and high -according to their quantitative impact on planned adjusted EBITDA. The impact classes are shown in the table above .\n\nThe impact classes were reviewed as part of the ERM process in the fourth quarter and in view of the change from EBIT as a key performance indicator to EBITDA. For example, the impact class 'high' increased for the 2022 financial year, for example, from 'x \u2265 \u20ac1 billion ' to 'x \u2265 \u20ac2 billion.'",

E.ON altered its methodology in the 2022 financial year from considering its average risk position over the time horizon of the medium -term plan to its maximum annual risk position.\n\nThe following description of risks by category alludes to the aforementioned impact classes. It also addresses major/high tail events and major/high qualitative risks. In the case of qualitative risks (which by definition are more difficult to assess both in terms of their loss amount and their probability), a further distinction is made between risks with a low probability (6 percent < x \u2264 25 percent) and a medium probability (26 percent < x \u2264 50 percent). Example: in category x, there is a risk y (medium, high) and a risk z (low, major).\n\n## Risk Position\n\n| Risk category              | Worst case (5th percentile)   | Best case (95th percentile)   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Legal and regulatory risks | Medium                        | Moderate                      |\n| Operational and IT risks   | Moderate                      | Low                           |\n| HSE, HR, and other         | Low                           | Low                           |\n| Market risks               | Material                      | Material                      |\n| Strategic risks            | Low                           | Low                           |\n| Finance and treasury risks | Material                      | Medium                        |\n\nIn the case of tail events and qualitative risks, the focus is not only on E.ON's key performance indicator, adjusted EBITDA, but also on other indicators relating to its asset and financial position.\n\nThe E.ON Group has major risk positions in the following categories: market risks as well as finance and treasury risks. As a result, the aggregate risk position of E.ON SE as a Group is major. In other words, the E.ON Group's maximum annual adjusted EBITDA risk ought not to exceed -\u20ac5 00 million to -\u20ac2 billion in 95 percent of all cases.\n\nThe further sharp increase in commodity prices in 2022 in conjunction with the Russia -Ukraine war has significant implications for the assessment of individual risks as well as, on the positive side, individual chances. On the one hand, the increase can affect wheeling volume and prices in the sales business; on the other, it is a material risk factor for possible bad debts in the sales business. Higher commodity prices also lead to a further increase in counterparty risks; however, our major suppliers' good credit ratings and system relevance continue to render the likelihood of occurrence very low (tail/high) .\n\nThe network business could likewise experience a decline in wheeling volumes, cre dit losses, and price increases for network losses which result in lower earnings. A distinctive feature of several of the regulatory jurisdictions in which we operate networks is that regulatory mechanisms generally foresee that a decline in wheeling volume and pricedriven cost increases for network losses can generally be recovered in subsequent years by corresponding adjustments to network tariffs.",

Also described are major risks and chances stemming from tail events as well as qualitative risks that would impact adjusted EBITDA by more than \u20ac 5 00 million. Also included are risks and chances that would affect planned net income and/or cash flow by more than \u20ac5 00 million.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nThe political, legal, and regulatory environment in which the E.ON Group does business is a source of risks. This could confront E.ON with direct and indirect consequences that could lead to possible financial disadvantages. New risks -but also opportunities -arise from energy -policy decisions at the European and national level. Foremost among them are the European Commission's Green Deal (which was presented in 2019 and revised and expanded in late 2020 ), the REPowerEU plan, and the proposal for a directive on common rules for the internal markets for renewable gases, natural gas, and hydrogen (at the end of 2021). Others include the German federal government's decision to phase out conventional hard -coal- and lignitefired power generation (the Coal Phaseout Law of August 2020) and the laws to set price caps on electricity, natural gas, and heat (at the end of 2022), whose purpose is to provide relief to households and companies for higher energy costs . The achievement of these (environmental) policy objectives will require legal and regulatory implementation measures that themselves could in the future pose new risks for certain E.ON Group business operations.\n\nIn the wake of the economic and financial crisis in many EU member states, interventionist policies and regulations have been adopted in recent years, such as additional taxes and additional reporting requirements (for example, EMIR, MAR, REMIT, MiFID2). The relevant agencies monitor compliance with these regulations closely. This leads to attendant risks for E.ON's operations. The same applies to price moratoriums, regulated price reductions, statutory price adjustment requirements, and changes to support\n\nschemes for renewables, which could pose risks to, as well as create chances for, E.ON's operations in the respective countries.\n\nThe operation of energy networks is subject to a large degree of government regulation. New laws and regulatory periods cause uncertainty for this business. In addition, matters related to Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act, such as issues regarding solar energy, can cause temporary fluctuations in cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The rapid growth of renewables is also creating new risks for the network business. For example, insolvencies among renewables operators or feed -in tariffs unduly paid by grid operators lead to court or regulatory proceedings.\n\nThis risk category also includes major risks arising from possible litigation, fines, and claims, governance and compliance issues, as well as risks and chances related to contracts and permits. Changes to this environment can lead to considerable uncertainty with regard to planning and, under certain circumstances, to impairment charges, but can also create chances. This results in a medium risk and a moderate chance position.\n\nThe operations of the E.ON Group's Customer Solutions segment subject it to certain risks relating to legal proceedings, ongoing planning processes, and regulatory changes. But these risks also relate, in particular, to legal actions and proceedings concerning contract and price adjustments to reflect market dislocations or (including as a consequence of the energy transition) an altered business climate in the power and gas business, alleged pri cerigging, and anticompetitive practices. This poses a major risk (tail/high).\n\nA significant change will result from Germany's implementation of the European Court of Justice's ruling requiring it to form a largely independent national regulatory agency, which could have an impact on the other EU countries in which E.ON conducts regulated business activities (low/major).\n\nPreussenElektra's business is substantially influenced by regulation as well . External risks associated with the policy and regulatory en vironment (such as liability risks, the approval of containers for the final storage of nuclear waste, the granting of approval for the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear power plant s) are addressed, for example, by constructive cooperation with supervisory and regulatory agencies and by the monitoring of legislation and court rulings (tail/high) .\n\n## Operational and IT Risks\n\nThe operational and strategic management of the E.ON Group relies heavily on complex information technology ('IT') and complex operati onal technology ('OT'). Consequently, there are risks and chances in conjunction with information security and the security of operating processes in E.ON's business segments.\n\nCybersecurity and the continuous protection of IT and OT systems against cyberattacks constitute a focus area of E.ON's risk management. Examples include the analysis of attacks on the systems of the network business (which could affect the operation of E.ON's critical infrastructure), on the sales business (which could result in the loss of customer data), and on internal systems (which E.ON uses to control commercial processes in all its business units). It is important that the operating units and the Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management divisions jointly and proactively eva luate and manage risks for E.ON.\n\nTechnologically complex production facilities are used in the production and distribution of energy, resulting in major risks from procurement and logistics, construction, operations and maintenance of assets as well as general project risks. The risks at PreussenElektra encompass dismantling activities as well. E.ON's operations in and outside Germany face major risks of a power failure, power -plant shutdown, and higher costs and additional investments resulting from unanticipated operational disruptions or other problems. Operational failures or extended production stoppages of facilities or components of facilities as well as environmental damage could negatively impact earnings, affect",

In unlikely cases, this could lead to a high risk. Overall, it results in a m oderate risk position and a low chance position in this category. General project risks can include delays and increased capital requirements.\n\nExtraordinary environmental events could also affect the operation of energy networks or equipment and equipment components. This could pose a liquidity risk for E.ON (tail/major).\n\nE.ON could also be subject to environmental liabilities associated with its power generation operations that could have a significant adverse impact on its business. In addition, new or amended environmental laws and regulations may result in cost increases for E.ON.\n\n## HSE, HR, and Other Risks\n\nHealth and occupational safety are important aspects of E.ON's day-today business. The Company's operating activities can therefore pose risks in these areas and create social and environmental risks and chances. In addition, E.ON's operating business potentially faces risks resulting from huma n error and employee turnover. It is important that E.ON act responsibly along its entire value chain and that it communicates consistently, enhances the dialog, and maintains good relationships with key stakeholders. E.ON actively considers environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. These efforts support the Company's business decisions and public relations. E.ON's objective is to minimize reputational risks and retain public acceptance so that the Company can continue to operate its business successfully. These matters result in a low risk and chance position.\n\nIn the past, predecessor entities of E.ON SE conducted mining operations, resulting in obligations in North Rhine -Westphalia and Bavaria (low/major). E.ON SE can be held responsible for damage. This could lead to major individual risks that E.ON currently only evaluates qualitatively.\n\n## Market Risks\n\nE.ON's units operate in an international market environment that is characterized by general risks relating to the business cycle. In addition, the entry of new suppliers into the marketplace along with more aggressive tactics by existing market participants and reputational risks have created a keener competitive environment for the Company's sales business in and outside Germany, which could reduce margins. However, market developments could also have a positive impact on E.ON's business. Such factors include wholesale and retail price developments, customer churn rates, and temporary volume effects in the network business. This results in a major risk and chance position in this category.\n\nThe demand for electric power and natural gas is seasonal, with E.ON's operations generally experiencing higher demand during the coldweather months of October through March and lower demand du ring the warm -weather months of April through September. As a result of these seasonal patterns, E.ON's sales and results of operations are higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. E.ON procures the required quant ities of electricity and gas for its customers based on robust demand forecasting methods. Nevertheless, actual customer demand may deviate from the forecast owing to various factors (such as the weather and the economy). Such deviations could have a positive or negative business impact, particularly in an environment of highly volatile prices. E.ON aims to reduce these impacts by, for example, pursuing a prudent hedging strategy in conjunction with a proactive approach to reforecasting or by pricing its risks vis -\u00e0vis customers.\n\nAfter the Uniper spinoff, E.ON established its own procurement organization for its sales business and ensured market access for the output of its remaining energy production in order to manage the remaining commodity risks accordingly. In addition, E.ON founded a subsidiary, E.ON Energy Markets GmbH ('EEM'), which functions as a central interface to wholesale markets. EEM's main purpose is to consolidate E.ON's commodity positions in order to diversify and mitigate credit and margin risks.\n\nEEM has so far acted on behalf of the main E.ON procurement portfolios in Germany and the Netherlands. Procurement activities in the United Kingdom are in the process of being added. OTC transactions were migrated to EEM in 2022; exchange transactions for gas will be migrated in 2023.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\nE.ON's business strategy involves acquisitions and investments in its core business as well as disposals. This strategy depends in part on the ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate such companies that enhance, on acceptable terms, the Company's energy business. In order to obtain the necessary approvals for acquisitions, E.ON may be required to divest other parts of its business or to make concessions or undertakings that affect its business. In addition, there can be no assurance that E.ON will be able to achieve the returns expected from any acquisition or investment. It is also possible that E.ON will not be able to realize its strategic ambition of enlarging its investment pipeline and that significant amounts of capital could be used for other opportunities. The overall risk and chance position in this category was low at the balance -sheet date.\n\nFurthermore, acquisitions and investments in new geographic areas or lines of business require E.ON to become familiar with new sales markets and competitors and to address the attending business risks .",

In addition, after transactions close E.ON could face major liability risks resulting from contractual obligations (tail/major).\n\n## Finance and Treasury Risks\n\nE.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through the use of financial instruments. Credit risk results from non -delivery or partial delivery by a counterparty or customer of the agreed consideration for services rendered, from total or partial failure to make payments owed on existing accounts receivable, and from replacement risks in open transactions. In addition, in unlikely cases joint and several liability for jointly operated power plants could lead to a major risk.\n\nE.ON's international business operations expose it to risks from currency fluctuation. One form of this risk is transaction risk, which arises when payments are made in a currency other than E.ON's functional currency. Another form of risk is translation risk, which arises when currency fluctuations lead to accounting effects when assets/liabilities and income/expenses of E.ON companies outside the eurozone are translated into euros and entered into E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements. Positive developments in foreign -currency rates can also create chances for E.ON's operating business.\n\nE.ON faces earnings risks relating to net income from financial liabilities, planned funding, and interest -rate derivatives that are based on variable interest rates and from non -current asset -retirement obligations.\n\nDerivative transactions may result in short -term cash inflows or outflows. This relates in particular to margin payments for electricity and gas procurement transactions on energy exchanges. The additional liquidity requirements potentially resulting from this are factored into E.ON's financing strategy.\n\nIn addition, the price changes and other uncertainty relating to the current and noncurrent investments E.ON makes to cover its noncurrent obligations (particularly pension and asset -retirement obligations) could, in individual cases, be major.\n\nIn principle, E.ON could also encounter tax risks and chances.\n\nThis category has a major risk and a medium chance position.\n\nFurthermore, declining or rising discount rates could lead to increased or reduced provisions for pensions and asset -retirement obligations, including non -current liabilities (tail, major). This can create a high balance -sheet risk for E.ON.\n\nRefinancing terms on debt capital markets depend in part on rating agencies' credit ratings. Rating agencies Moody's, S&P , and Fitch have given E.ON a strong investment -grade rating. E.ON has contracts that would trigger additional collateral requirements if certain rating levels were not met. Consequently, significant rating downgrades could lead to additional liquidity requirements (tail/high). On the other hand, positive business performance or further debt reduction could have a positive impact on E.ON's rating.\n\n## ESG Risks and Chances\n\n\u25ba E.ON strives to operate responsibly at all times and theref ore monitors all the material impacts of its business activities. Alongside financial aspects, E.ON also considers environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') aspects along its value chain. This encompasses monitoring and assessing ESG risks and chances as well as their possible impact on the E.ON Group, but also the impact of E.ON's business activities on the climate, the environment, employees, suppliers, and customers. The systematic consideration of non -financial issues enables the Company to identify opportunities and risks for business development at an early stage.\n\nE.ON has integrated the reporting of non -financial risks related to ESG and their impact on the Group into the ERM. All risks and chances related to ESG are made identifi able in the ERM system. E.ON views ESG risks as factors in the known risk categories listed below. Sustainability risks can have a considerable impact on all of these known risk categories and can be a factor in contributing to their materiality.\n\nIn addition, E.ON analyzes potential reportable risks within the meaning of Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Sentence 1, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: 'HGB'), while taking into account its ESG materiality analysis, management approaches, and the ERM's findings. This involves considering risks relating to environmental, employee, and social matters as well as human rights, anti -corruption, and anti -bribery. At yearend 2022, E.ON had not identified any major risks related to its own business activities and business relationships as well as products and services pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Sentence 1, Items 3 and 4 of the HGB that are very likely to have or will have serious negative impacts on ESG aspects.\n\nE.ON places an emphasis on analyzing its climate risks, in part because of E.ON's support of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -Related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD'). Safeguarding its assets against climate -change impacts and the climate resilience of its business model are economically relevant to E.ON. Our analysis therefore includes both physical risks (direct impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) and transitory risks resulting from the transition to a low -carbon and more climate -resilient economy (such as changes in consumer preferences, the regulatory environment, and carbon pricing ).\n\nPhysical climate risks are also the focus of the EU Taxonomy Regulation's do -nosignificant -harm ('DNSH') provisions (see the 'EU Taxonomy' chapter). They are assigned to the EU environmental objective 2 'climate change adaptation.' E.ON assesses DNSH compliance with climate change adaptation at the",

Each E.ON Group business unit is required to comprehensively assess and record climate risks as part of its risk reporting. Any risks that significantly jeopardize climate change adaptation are identified in the risk management process. This basic approach to identifying any potential harm to climate change adaptation is verified in consultation with relevant specialist departments.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 E.ON for the first time developed a qualitative scenario analysis describing the impact of three different climate scenarios on E.ON and on individual E.ON business units through 2050. This involved defining three reference scenarios (conservative, ambitious, and fully committed) and assessing and identifying the relevant business units on the basis of key value drivers and related key performance indicators ('KPIs'). The next step was to develop a qualitative scenario impact analysis by analyzing the key value drivers identified by the business units and by performing a risk assessment as well as by evaluating the business impacts. The last step was to develop strategic recommendations.\n\nThis scenario analysis was enlarged in 2022 and applied to the climate risks defined in the EU taxonomy. First, E.ON's main EU taxonomy -aligned economic activities and its companies making the main contribution to the corresponding investments were identified centrally. Next, these companies used a bottom -up process to determine the climate risks for the relevant economic activities or investments in accordance with the EU taxonomy catalog. These risks were then subjected to a scenario analysis. A qualitative risk assessment was performed for each identified climate risk and economic activity in line with the IPCC scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP58.5 for the reference period 2041 to 2060. This risk assessment does not differ in nature from the risks already reported and managed in the ERM. As for the amount of damage estimated in the scenario analysis, there are also no significant deviations from the century events for weather or climate risks already reported in the ERM. \u25c4\n\n## Management Board's Evaluation of the Risk and Chances Situation\n\nThe E.ON Group's overall risk and chances situation at year -end 2022 change d materially relative to year -end 202 1, in particular because of higher commodity prices. Although the maximum annual risk for the E.ON Group's adjusted EBITDA over the period under consideration is classified as major and despite the increase in counterparty risk resulting from the development of commodity prices and risks resulting from lawsuits and legal proceeding relating to contract and price adjustments at Customer Solutions, from today's perspective E.ON does not perceive any risk profile that could threaten the existence of E.ON SE, the E.ON Group, or individual segments.",

Energy Networks (Germany, Sweden, and East -Central Europe/Turkey), Customer Solutions (Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Other), Non -Core Business, and Corporate Functions/Other are the Company's IFRS -reportable segments.\n\nE.ON SE prepares its Financial Statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code, the SE Ordinance (in conjunction with the German Stock Corporation Act), and the German Energy Act.\n\nE.ON prepares a Combined Group Management Report which applies to both the E.ON Group and E.ON SE.\n\n## Accounting Process\n\nAll companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements must comply with E.ON's uniform Accounting and Reporting Guidelines for the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. These guidelines describe applicable IFRS accounting and valuation principles. They also explain accounting principles typical in the E.ON Group, such as those for provisions for nuclear -waste management, the\n\ntreatment of financial instruments, and the treatment of regulatory obligat ions. E.ON regularly analyzes amendments to laws, new or amended accounting standards, and other important pronouncements for their relevance to, and consequences for, the Consolidated Financial Statements and, if necessary, update its guidelines and systems accordingly.\n\nCorporate Functions defines and oversees the roles and responsibilities of various Group entities in the preparation of E.ON SE's Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements. These roles and responsibilities are described in a Group Policy document.\n\nE.ON Group companies are responsible for preparing their financial statements in a proper and timely manner. They receive substantial support from Business Service Centers in Regensburg, Germany; Cluj, Romania; and Krak\u00f3w, Poland. E.ON SE combines the financial statements of subsidiaries belonging to its scope of consolidation into its Consolidated Financial Statements using standard consolidation software. Group Accounting is responsible for conducting the consolidation and for monitoring adherence to the guidelines for scheduling, processes, and contents. Monitoring by means of system -based automated controls is supplemented by manual checks.\n\nIn conjunction with the year -end closing process, additional qualitative and quantitative information relevant for accounting is compiled. Furthermore, dedicated quality -control processes are in place for all relevant departments to discuss and ensure the completeness of important information on a regular basis.\n\nE.ON SE's Financial Statements are prepared with SAP software. The accounting and preparation processes are divided into discrete functional steps. Bookkeeping processes have largely been outsourced to E.ON's Business Service Centers. Cluj has the primary responsibility for processes relating to subsidiary ledgers and several bank activities. Regensburg has the principal responsibility for processes relating to the general ledgers.\n\nAutomated or manual controls are integrated into each step. Defined procedures ensure that all transactions and the preparation of E.ON SE's Financial Statements are recorded, processed, assigned on an accrual basis, and documented in a complete, timely, and accurate manner. Relevant data from E.ON SE's Financial Statements are, if necessary, adjusted to conform with IFRS and then transferred to the consolidation software system using SAP -supported transfer technology.\n\nThe following explanations about E.ON's internal control system ('ICS') and its general IT controls apply equally to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to E.ON SE's Financial Statements.\n\n## Internal Control System\n\nThe purpose of the ICS framework and the annual ICS process is to provide sufficient assurance to prevent error or fraud from resulting in material misrepresentations in the Financial Statements, the Combined Group Management Report, the Half -Year Financial Report, the Quarterly Statements, as well as ESG r eporting. Furthermore, it serves to assure compliance to significant internal and external regulations and to assure effectiveness and efficiency of business activities. The management of each unit in the E.ON Group is legally responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal control system ('ICS'). The Compliance function is responsible for t he implementation of the c ompliance management system (' CMS ') which is described in the Corporate Governance Declaration. The ICS department at Corporate Audit is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the overall ICS process in order to ensure an effective ICS in the E.ON Group. For this purpose, the ICS department at Corporate Audit provides the ICS framework and the necessary tools. An ICS Business Partner ('ICS BP') is assigned to each unit which is of particular importance to the E.ON Group and therefore in the ICS documentation scope. The ICS BP is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the unit's ICS activities and advises and supports management in implementing an effective internal control system. The unit's",

The ICS BP system ensures a uniform approach as well as consistent and efficient collaboration and fosters continuous improvement by means of extensive information -sharing among Group companies.\n\n## E.ON's ICS Framework\n\nE.ON's ICS is based on the globally recognized COSO framework from May 2013 (COSO: The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission).\n\nThe catalog of ICS P rinciples, which defines the minimum requirements for an effective internal control system, is a key component of E.ON's ICS. It contain s overarching principles such as authorization, segregation of duties, and master data management as well as specific requirements for managing potential risks in various areas and processes, such as supplier monitoring, project management, invoice verification, payments, and ESG reporting . All fully consolidated companies and majority -owned units are subject to the ICS Principles.\n\nIn addition to the ICS Principles, certain units of special importance to the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements must fulfill several additional ICS requirements for selected processes. These requirements relate to the documentation and assessment of the rele vant processes and controls -the ICS model -as well as reporting to Corporate Audit. The ICS model, which incorporates company -and industry -specific aspects, defines potential risks for accounting (financial reporting), for ESG reporting (non -financial repo rting), for compliance with important internal and external rules, and for the operating units' of their operating targets, and serves as a checklist, and provides guidance for the establishment of internal controls as well as their documentation and implementation.\n\nA functionally managed digital organization and third -party service providers provide IT and digital services for the E.ON Group. IT systems used for accounting as well as IT systems relevant for the\n\nESG-Reporting a re subject to the internal control system framework, which includes IT general controls, such as access controls, segregation of duties, processing controls, measures to prevent the intentional and unintentional falsification of the programs, data, and documents as well as controls rel ated to supplier monitoring. The documentation of the IT general controls is stored in E.ON's documentation system.\n\nEach year, qualitative criteria and quantitative materiality aspects are used to determine which processes and controls must be documented and assessed by which E.ON units.\n\nE.ON units in the ICS documentation scope use a central documentation system (SAP -GRC) for this purpose. The system contains the scope, detailed documentation requirements, the assessment requirements for process owners, and the final Sign -Off process.\n\n## Management Self-Assessment and Control Tests\n\nAfter E.ON units have documented their processes and controls, the individual process owners conduct an annual assessment of the design and the operational effectiveness of the controls embedded in these processes and the ICS principles. This is known as a management self -assessment. The assessment is supported by tests of control effectiveness for selective risk areas. Corporate Audit's ICS department defines the methodology for these tests, which are conducted by the process owners or employees assigned by them.\n\nIn addition, the effectiveness of the internal controls is audited by Internal Audit. These audits are conducted based on a risk -oriented audit plan. Any identified deficiencies are reported to the relevant companies.\n\nFurthermore, the general IT controls, the controls of the Business Service Centers in Regensburg and Cluj, the controls of the Human Resources Service Center in Germany (E.ON Country Hub Germany GmbH), and the controls of the Pension Service\n\nCompany in Germany (Energie Pensions -Management GmbH) were audited as part of the audit of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe findings of the management self -assessments and the audits are included in the annual report on the effectiveness of the entire E.ON Group's ICS and are reported to the E.ON SE Management Board.\n\n## Sign-Off Process\n\nBased on the self -assessment result and internal and external audit findings, the respective management of the unit conducts the final SignOff. The final step of the internal evaluation process is the submission of a formal written declaration confirming the ICS's effectiveness ('Sign -Off'). The Sign -Off process is conducted at all levels of the Group companies before E.ON SE, as the final step, conducts it for the Group as a whole. The Chairman of the E.ON SE Management Board and the Chief Financial Officer perform the final Sign -Off for the E.ON Group.\n\nCorporate Audit regularly informs the E.ON SE Supervisory Board's Audit & Risk Committee about the ICS for financial reporting and about any significant deficiencies identified in the E.ON Group's various processes.",

Each share of stock grants the same rights and one vote at a Shareholders Meeting.\n\n## Restrictions on Voting Rights or the Transfer of Shares\n\nAn employee stock -purchase program was offered in 2021 and 2022 . Shares acquired by employees under the employee stock -purchase program are subject to a blackout period that begins the day ownership of such shares is transferred to the employee and that ends on December 31 of the next calendar year plus one. As a rule, an employee may not sell such shares until the blackout period has expired.\n\nPursuant to Section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (German abbreviation: 'AktG'), the Company's treasury shares give it no rights, including no voting rights.\n\n## Legal Provisions and Rules of the Company's Articles of Association Regarding the Appointment and Dismissal of Management Board Members and Amendments to the Articles of Association\n\nPursuant to the Company's Articles of Association, the Management Board consists of at least two members. The Supervisory Board decides on the number of members as well as on their appointment and dismissal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board appoints members to the Management Board for a term not exceeding five years; reappointment is permissible. If several persons are appointed as members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board may appoint one of the members as Chairperson of the Management Board. If there is a vacancy on the Management Board for a required member, the court makes the necessary appointment upon petition by a concerned party in the event of an urgent matter. The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of a member of the Management Board and of the Chairperson of the Management Board for serious cause (for further details, see Sections 84 and 85 of the AktG).\n\nResolutions of the Shareholders Meeting require a majority of the valid votes cast unless mandatory law or the Articles of Association explicitly prescribe otherwise. An amendment to the Articles of Association requires a two -thirds majority of the votes cast or, in cases where at least half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast unless mandatory law explicitly prescribes another type of majority.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to decide by resolution on amendments to the Articles of Association that affect only their wording (Section 10, Paragraph 7, of the Articles of Association).\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the wording of Section 3 of the Articles of Association upon utilization of authorized or conditional capital.\n\n## Management Board's Power to Issue or Buy Back Shares\n\nPursuant to a resolution of the Shareholders Meeting of May 28, 2020, the Management Board is authorized, until May 27, 2025, to have the Company acquire treasury shares. The shares acquired and other treasury shares that are in possession of or to be attributed to the Company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq. of the\n\nAktG must altogether at no point account for more than 10 percent of the Company's share capital.\n\nAt the Management Board's discretion, the acquisition may be conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 through a stock exchange\n- \u00b7 by means of a public offer directed at all shareholders or a public solicitation to submit offers\n- \u00b7 by means of a public offer or a public solicitation to submit offers for the exchange of liquid shares that are admitted to trading on an organized market, within the meaning of the German Securities Purchase and Takeover Law, for Company shares\n- \u00b7 by the use of derivatives (put or call options or a combination of both).\n\nThese authorizations may be utilized on one or several occasions, in whole or in partial amounts, in pursuit of one or more objectives by the Company and also by its affiliated companies or by third parties for the Company's account or one of its affiliates' account.\n\nWith regard to treasury shares that will be, or have been, acquired based on the aforementioned authorization and/or prior authorizations by the Shareholders Meeting, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the Supervisory Board's consent and excluding shareholder subscription rights, to use these shares -in addition to a disposal through a stock exchange or an offer granting a subscription right to all shareholders -as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 to be sold and transferred against cash consideration\n- \u00b7 to be sold and transferred against contributions in kind",

Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains more information about Conditional Capital 2020.\n\n## Significant Agreements to Which the Company Is a Party That Take Effect on a Change of Control of the Company Following a Takeover Bid\n\nThe underlying contracts of debt issued since 2007 contain change -of -control clauses that give the creditor the right of cancellation. This applies, inter alia, to bonds issued by E.ON SE and E.ON International Finance B.V. and guaranteed by E.ON SE and other instruments such as credit contracts. Granting change -of -control rights to creditors is considered good corporate governance and has become standard market practice. More information about financial liabilities is contained in the section of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Financial Situation and in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Settlement Agreements between the Company and Management Board Members or Employees in the Case of a Change -of -Control Event\n\nIn the event of a premature loss of a Management Board position due to a change -of -control event, the service agreements of Management Board members entitle them to severance and settlement payments.\n\nTo the extent that the Company has agreed to settlement payments for Management Board members in the case of a change of control, the purpose of such agreements is to preserve the independence of Management Board members.\n\nA change -of -control event would also result in the early payout of virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan.\n\n## Other Disclosures Regarding Takeovers\n\nThe Company has been notified about the following direct or indirect interests in its share capital that exceed 10 percent of the voting rights:\n\n- \u00b7 notification on December 10, 2020, by RWE Aktiengesellschaft for 15 percent of the voting rights .\n\nStock with special rights granting power of control has not been issued.

The changes resulting from the amended version of the German Corporate Governance Code of April 28, 2022, published in the official section of the Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022, were also discussed. It was determined that E.ON SE fully complies with all of the Code's recommendations. In addition, E.ON fully complies with all of the Code's suggestions.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe goal of compliance at E.ON is to prevent or at least detect and put a stop to corporate misconduct. It is E.ON's responsibility never to deceive, lie to, or otherwise deliberately harm its customers, business partners, or other stakeholders. Strict compliance with laws and company policies is therefore the foundation of good corporate governance.\n\nE.ON has in place a compliance management system ('CMS') to mitigate the risk of compliance violations. The CMS is based on a number of widely recognized practices, including the promotion of a compliance culture. This encompasses an active commitment to compliance targets, the identification and analysis of compliance risks, and the design of a risk -adequate compliance program and a compliance organization.\n\nE.ON's Supplier Code and its Code of Conduct (both of which are available in the languages of all countries in which E.ON operates) focus on the guiding principle, 'Doing the right thing.' They provide easy -tounderstand guidance, in particular human rights, anticorruption, fair competition, and compliant relationships with E.ON's business partners. The Code of Conduct also contains an integrity test that employees can use to check whether their assessment of a situation is in compliance with E.ON principles and values. Every employee in the E.ON Group is obliged to act in accordance with the Code of Conduct's rules. The Code is therefore part of E.ON employees' duties under their employment contract. Employees and third parties can report violations of the Code of Conduct, anonymously, if they wish, by means of a whistle -blower hotline. The Code of Conduct is published on the Internet. It is supplemented by ten Group -wide People Guidelines which explain in greater detail how employees can be sure that they are doing things right.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is one of the key aspects of the strategy E.ON updated in 2021. E.ON's business activities are guided by the",

E.ON's strategy sets ambitious sustainability targets to provide guidance. Their main theme is the fight against climate change and E.ON's contribution to decarbonizing the energy world: E.ON aims for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to be climate -neutral by 2040 and also to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 100 percent by 2050 (relative to 2019). The climate crisis requires swift action. E.ON therefore intends to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75 percent by 2030. For this purpose, E.ON has put in place a Group -wide system to manage its CO 2 emissions.\n\nIn addition, four key sustainability targets are part of the compensation system for the E.ON Management Board and for all senior executives: the reduction of direct emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2), the increase in proportion of female executives, the reduction of serious safety incidents among our employees ('Mission ZERO'), and the Group's performance in ESG ratings. Sustainability issues' high degree of relevance for E.ON is underscored by the CEO's Sustainability Council, which meets on a regular basis and includes representatives from various E.ON business units.\n\nE.ON's risk management system addresses major ESG risks as well. High -quality ESG data form the basis for holistic business decisions. Furthermore, E.ON has stepped up the collection of ESG data in its reporting and internal control systems in order to continually improve data quality and data availability.\n\n## Transparent Management\n\nTransparent management is a high priority of the Management Board and Supervisory Board. E.ON's shareholders, all capital market participants, financial analysts, shareholder associations, and the media regularly receive up -todate information about the situation of, and any material changes to, the Company. E.ON primarily uses the Internet to provide equal access to comprehensive and timely information.\n\nE.ON SE issues reports about its and the E.ON Group's situation and earnings by the following means:\n\n- \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report and Annual Finance Statements,\n- \u00b7 Half -Year Financial Report and Quarterly Statements\n- \u00b7 Annual press conferences and other analysts conferences\n- \u00b7 Press releases\n- \u00b7 Telephone conferences held on most releases of the quarterly and annual results\n- \u00b7 Numerous discussions with financial analysts in and outside Germany\n- \u00b7 Periodic events for investors\n- \u00b7 E.ON Green Bond Report a nd the 'Supporting paper on E.ON's decarbonization strategy and climate -related aspects.'\n\nA financial calendar lists the dates on which the Company's periodic financial reports are released.\n\nThe Company issues ad hoc statements about information that could have a significant impact on the price of E.ON stock.\n\nThe Supervisory Board Chairman is involved to a suitable extent in E.ON's communications with investors at an annual corporate governance roadshow. The main topics are the scope of the Supervisory Board Chairman's duties and responsibilities, the influence of regulatory requirements on the Supervisory Board's work, and the Annual Shareholders Meeting. Alongside governance issues, interest in environmental and social issues has become increasingly important in investor dialog. These issues are therefore an essential part of the corporate governance roadshow .\n\nThe financial calendar and ad hoc statements are available on the Internet.\n\n## Management Board\n\n## Management Board Members\n\nIn 2022 the Management Board consisted of five members and had one Chairman. The members were four men and one woman. As a result, t he statutory minimum composition requirement of at least one woman and at least one man, which applied from August 1, 2022, was already met before the requirement took effect. No Management Board member has more than two supervisory board memberships in listed non -Group companies or on the supervisory bodies of non -Group companies that require a similar commitment. No Management Board member has reached the general retirement age.\n\nMore detailed information about the members of the Management Board and their CVs, which are updated annually, are available on the E.ON SE website.\n\n## Management Board's Way of Working\n\nThe E.ON SE Management Board manages the Company's businesses, with all its members bearing joint responsibility for its decisions. It determines the Group's objectives, corporate policy, organizational setup, and, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, its fundamental strategic direction. The Management Board has in place policies and procedures for the business it conducts",

It also submits the Group's investment, finance, and personnel plan for the next financial year as well as the medium -term plan to the Supervisory Board, generally at the last meeting of each financial year.\n\nThe Chairman of the Management Board informs, without undue delay, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of important events that are of fundamental significance in assessing the Company's situation, development, and management and of any defects that have arisen in the Company's monitoring systems. Transactions and measures requiring the Supervisory Board's approval are also submitted to the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.\n\nMembers of the Management Board are required to promptly report conflicts of interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Management Board and to inform the other members of the Management Board. Members of the Management Board may only assume other corporate positions, particularly appointments to the supervisory boards of no n-Group companies, with the consent of the Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAny material transactions between the Company and members of the Management Board, their relatives, or entities with which they have close personal ties require the consent of the Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board. No such transactions took place in the reporting period.\n\n## Management Board Committees\n\nThe Management Board has no board committees but has established a number of committees that support it in the fulfillment of its tasks. The members of these committees are senior representatives of various departments of E.ON SE whose experience, responsibilities, and expertise make them particularly suited for their committee's tasks. Among these committees are the following:\n\nThe Management Board has established a Disclosure Committee and an Ad hoc Committee for issues relating to financial disclosures. These committees ensure that all information is disclosed in a correct and timely fashion.\n\nIn addition, a Risk Committee ensures the correct application and implementation of the legal requirements of Section 91 of the AktG. This committee monitors the E.ON Group's risk situation and its risk -bearing capacity and devotes particular attention to the early identification of developments that could potentially threaten the Company's continued existence. In this context, the Risk Committee also deals with risk -mitigation strategies (including hedging strategies). In collaboration with relevant departments, the committee ensures and refines the implementation of, and compliance with, company policies regarding commodity risks, credit risks, and enterprise risk management.\n\n## Statement on the E.ON Group's Internal Control System and Enterprise Risk Management System in the Narrow Sense\n\nThe entire E.ON SE Management Boards affirms that it is aware of its responsibility to establish and maintain a suitable and effective Internal Control System ('ICS') and a Enterprise Risk Management System ('ERM') for the E.ON Group and that its examination of the ICS and ERM along with the reports of the Corporate Audit and Group Risk departments have not made it aware of any circumstances that would speak against these systems' suitability and effectiveness.\n\n## Diversity Concept and Long-term Succession Plan for the Management Board\n\nWith regard to the Management Board's composition, the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE has developed a diversity concept that considers the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Diversity Concept\n\nWhen appointing members of the Management Board, the candidates' outstanding professional qualifications, long -term leadership experience and past performance, as well as value -driven management shall be of paramount importance. Members shall be capable of taking forward -looking strategic decisions. In particular, they shall be capable of managing businesses sustainably and of ensuring that they are consistently focused on customer needs.\n\nThe Management Board as a whole must have expertise and experience in the energy sector as well as in the fields of finance and digitization.\n\nThe members of the Management Board shall be leaders and as such shall act as role models for the employees through their own performance and conduct.\n\nAttention shall be paid to diversity when appointing members of the Management Board. For the Supervisory Board, diversity means, in particular, different complementary academic profiles, professional and personal experience, personalities, as well as internationality and a reasonable age and gender structure.\n\nThe appointment period of a member of the Management Board shall end, at the latest, at the end of the month on which the Management Board member reaches the general retirement age.",

Appointment decisions are made on the basis of specific requirement profiles for Management Board members.\n\nIn addition to its own experience, the Supervisory Board draws on the expertise of outside consultants to ensure that the Company's succession planning is appropriate and creates value.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is informed on a regular basis (once a year) by the Management Board on the progress in talent identification and development as well as succession planning for top executives on the basis of the qualifications required for business success and the continually evolving personnel development processes. It discusses the respective status accordingly.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## Supervisory Board Members\n\nTo ensure that, after the acquisition of the majority of the shares of innogy SE (in 2019), innogy's employees are represented without delay on the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE as the Group's parent company, the Supervisory Board was enlarged to 20 members for a limited period of time. The Articles of Association provide for the Supervisory Board to again consist of 12 members from the conclusion of the 2023 Annual Shareholders Meeting. Pursuant to E.ON SE's Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is composed of an equal number of shareholder and employee representatives. The shareholder representatives are elected by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders Meeting; the Supervisory Board nominates candidates for this purpose. The\n\nAnnual Shareholders Meeting decides on the elections by individual vote. Pursuant to the agreement regarding employees' involvement in E.ON SE, the other currently ten members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the SE Works Council, with the provision that at least three different countries are represented and one member is selected by a trade union that is represented at E.ON SE or one of its subsidiaries in Germany.\n\nThe current members of the Supervisory Board are listed on the E.ON SE homepage along with information about their other directorships and their CVs.\n\n## Competence and Diversity Concept\n\nIn view of recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code (version dated April 28, 2022) and Section 289f, Paragraph 2, Item 6, of the German Commercial Code, the Supervisory Board defined specific targets for its composition, including a diversity concept and competency profile for the entire body, that go beyond the applicable legal requirements and are as follows:\n\n'The composition of the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE shall comply with the specific SE requirements and Germany's Stock Corporation Act, and with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n- a) The following general objectives shall be observed:\n- \u00b7 At least more than half of the shareholder representatives shall according to their estimation -be independent from the Company and the Executive Board. Members shall be deemed to be independent if they have no personal or business relationship with the Company or its Executive Board, where such relationship may give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of interests. In assessing the independence of its members from the Company and its Executive Board, the shareholder side shall in particular consider whether the Superviso ry Board member or a close family member was a\n\nmember of the Executive Board of the Company in the two years prior to the appointment, currently or up to the year of appointment, directly or as a shareholder or in a responsible function of a company outside the Group maintains or has maintained a significant business relationship with the Company or a company dependent on it, is a close family member of a member of the Executive Board or has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years.\n\n- \u00b7 The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Executive Committee shall be independent of the Company and the Executive Board.\n- \u00b7 The Supervisory Board shall not include more than two former members of the Executive Board.\n- \u00b7 Members of the Supervisory Board must not have seats on the boards of, or act as consultants for, any of the Company's major competitors or have a personal relationship with a competitor.\n- \u00b7 Supervisory Board membership shall be limited to no more than 12 years.\n- \u00b7 All Supervisory Board members must have sufficient time available to perform their duties on the boards of various companies. Anyone who is not a member of the Executive Board of a listed company shall only be a member of the Supervis ory Board of E.ON if he or she does not hold more than five Supervisory Board mandates at non -group listed companies or comparable functions, whereby a Supervisory Board chairmanship counts double. A person who is a member of the Executive Board of a listed company shall only be a member of the Supervisory Board of E.ON if he/she does not hold more than two Supervisory Board mandates in total at non -group listed companies or comparable functions and does not chair the Supervisory Board of a non -group listed company.",

When preparing nominations for the election of Supervisory Board members, due consideration shall be given in each case to the question as to whether complementary academic profiles, professional and life experience, a balanced age mix, various personalities and a reasonable gender balance benefit the Supervisory Board's work. In this context, care shall be taken to ensure that a gender quota of 30 percent will be achieved; this shall apply to the Supervisory Board as a whole and to the shareholders' and employees' representatives separately.\n- \u00b7 The members of the Supervisory Board shall usually not hold office for longer than the age of 75. They shall not be older than 72 years at the time of their election.\n- \u00b7 At least four Supervisory Board members shall have international experience, i.e. they shall have spent, for instance, part of their professional career outside Germany.\n- c) In addition, the following skills profile shall apply; especially the Nominations Committee will strive to apply the skills profile when preparing nominations of candidates for the shareholders' representatives to be proposed to the Annual General Meeting.\n- \u00b7 The majority of the members should have specific knowledge in the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge of sales and customer business.\n- \u00b7 At least two members shall have specific knowledge related to regulated industries.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge in the areas of new technologies, digitization and IT.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge related to new business models, innovation and disruption.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge of the functioning of the capital and financial markets.\n- \u00b7 At least one independent shareholder representative shall have special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and at least one other independent shareholder representative shall have special knowledge and experience in auditing.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge in the field of sustainability, specifically in the dimensions of environmental concerns (especially reduction of CO 2 emissions), employee and social concerns as well as human rights and anti -corruption.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge in the subject areas of human resources and cultural change.\n- \u00b7 At least two members should have specific knowledge in the areas of law and compliance.\n- \u00b7 At least four members shall have experience, as Executive or Supervisory Board members, in the strategic management or supervision of listed organizations.'\n\nIn view of continually changing business requirements, the Supervisory Board will continue to identify necessary competencies early to ensure that these are covered.\n\n## Current Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\na) The members of the E.ON SE Supervisory Board fulfill all requirements imposed by applicable law and the German Corporate Governance Code for the acceptance of a Supervisory Board position. In particular, the Supervisory Board believes that all of its members, in particular the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Chairpersons of all its committees, are independent. No former Management Board member or a close family member of a Management Board member sits on the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, no Supervisory Board member currently has or had in the year up to his or her appointment, either directly or as a shareholder or in a responsible role in a company outside the Group, a significant business relationship with the Company or one of its affiliates. No Supervisory Board member exercises any executive or advisory functions for major competitors, has a personal relationship with a major competitor, or has been a Supervisory Board member for more than 15 years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's assessment of independence considered the fact that Karen de Segundo has been a Supervisory Board member since 2008 and is thus the only member to have been a member for more than 12 years. In view of the changes in the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board in recent years, Ms. de Segundo continues to maintain the objective detachment from the Company and its Management Board necessary to perform her monitoring role. Furthermore, she does not and has not at any time in the past had a significant business or personal relationship with the Company, one of its affiliates, or the Management Board, either directly or as a shareholder or in a responsible capacity in a company outside the Group. She is therefore independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe Supervisory Board believes that in the case of no Supervisory Board member there are specific indications of relevant situations or relationships that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The Supervisory Board included only one serving member of the executive board of listed companies during the course of the year,",

In addition, Ms. Dybeck Happe had no more than two seats on the supervisory boards of non -Group listed companies or exercised comparable functions. None of the other Supervisory Board members had seats on more than five supervisory boards of nonGroup listed companies or exercised comparable functions. In the reporting year, no conflicts of interest of individual members were reported to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Such an obligation is stipulated in Section 18 of the Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure.\n\nb) In its current composition the Supervisory Board meets the objectives of its diversity concept. The Supervisory Board's composition of women and men complies with the legal requirements for minimum percentages; separate compliance with the statutory gender quota by the employee and shareholder sides occurred from the 2018 Annual Shareholders Meeting. The age ran ge of the Supervisory Board is currently 4 7 to 76 years. At 76, Ms. de Segunda has surpassed the age of 75. Consequently, she will end her service at the conclusion of her appointment, which coincides with the conclusion of the 2023 Annual Shareholders Mee ting. At least four members have international experience.\n\nIn their entirety, the members bring a wide range of specific knowledge to committee work and have special expertise in one or more businesses and markets relevant to the Company.\n\nThe Supervisory Board believes that the requirements of the Supervisory Board's competency profile are met by the current members of the Supervisory Board. The following qualification matrix indicates the status of implementation:",

Andreas Schmitz has many years of experience in banking and has been a member of the Audit and Risk Committee of E.ON SE since April 2017 an d its Chairman since May 2018. He was a member of the Audit and Risk Committee of various other companies and has been extensively involved and familiar with accounting topics, sustainability reporting and auditing, and internal control and risk management systems for many years. Ulrich Grillo, who holds a degree in business administration, worked in the past as audit manager at auditing firm Arthur Andersen LLP. In addition, Mr. Grillo is a member of the Rheinmetall AG Supervisory Board and has been a member of its Audit Committee as well since 2017 and has therefore been involved with issues relating to accounting, internal control and risk management systems, and the audit of financial statements for many years. Both also qualify as independent in the opinion of the Supervisory Board.\n\nNew members of the Supervisory Board initially complete an onboarding process. In addition to individualized thematic onboarding, in which external Supervisory Board members are familiarized in depth with the structures, processes, and specific topics of E.ON's business activities, such as its business areas, market development, strategy, and capital market story, all new Supervisory Board members receive a collection of all relevant in formation and documents.\n\n## The Supervisory Board's Way of Working\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees the Company's management and advises the Management Board on an ongoing basis. The Management Board requires the Supervisory Board's prior approval for significant transactions and measures. The transactions requiring prior approval are listed in particular in\n\nSection 10 the Rules of Procedure, which are published on the Company's Internet page.\n\nThe Supervisory Board holds at least four regular meetings in each financial year. Its rules and procedures include mechanisms by which, if necessary, a meeting of the Supervisory Board or one of its committees can be called at any time at the request of a Management Board member. Specific details on the number of meetings and their preparation, the attendance of Supervisory Board members, and the relevant topics can be found in the 2022 Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established Rules of Procedure for itself, which are available on the Company's Internet page.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established four committees: the Executive Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee, the Innovation and Sustainability Committee, and the Nomination Committee.\n\nThe specific members of the committees and their chairpersons and deputy chairpersons are named at eon.com/en /aboutus/supervisory -board.html. The Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure stipulates the individual committees' respective tasks and the number of their members.\n\nThe Executive Committee is, in particular, responsible for preparing the meetings of the Supervisory Board and advising the Management Board on matters of general policy relating to the Company's strategic development. It decides on the Supervisory Board's behalf in urgent cases and in the case of measures requiring prior approval that do not exceed certain thresholds stipulated in the Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure. In addition, it is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the Supervisory Board's personnel decisions.\n\nIn particular, the Audit and Risk Committee deals with the monitoring of accounting including the accounting process; the effectiveness of the internal control system, the internal risk management system, and the internal audit system; compliance as well as the auditing of financial statements.\n\nThe Innovation and Sustainability Committee advises the Management Board on innovation issues and growth opportunities as well as E.ON's digital transformation. In addition, the committee advises the Supervisory Board and the Management Board on environmental, social, governance ('ESG'), and sustainability issues.\n\nThe Nomination Committee recommends to the Supervisory Board suitable candidates for election to the Supervisory Board by the Annual Shareholders Meeting. For this purpose, the members of the Nomination Committee are in contact with potential candidates on an ongoing basis. In particular, candidate screening is conducted in part with the support of personnel consultants, during which the members of the Executive Committee satisfy themselves that the selection of candidates will meet the targets for the Supervisory Board's composition and that the candidates are able to commit the necessary time to their role. The Chairman of the Nomination Committee keeps the Supervisory Board informed on an ongoing basis of the status of considerations regarding the nomination of new Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee, Executive Committee, and the Innovation and Sustainability Committee meet at regular intervals and when specific circumstances require it in accordance with their task areas as defined in the Rules of Procedure. The Nomination Committee has adopted a resolution at least once annually since 2016. The Report of the Supervisory Board contains information about the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the year under review.",

An online questionnaire provided the Supervisory Board members with the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board's work and to make suggestions for improving it. The Chairman then held detailed one -onone discussions with the members of the Supervisory Board for the purpose of improving the Supervisory Board's work. The findings were used to design specific measures to improve the Supervisory Board's work, which are being implemented on an ongoing basis. They relate primarily to the content of the meetings and their preparation.\n\n## Shareholders and Annual Shareholders Meeting\n\nE.ON SE shareholders exercise their rights and vote their shares at the Annual Shareholders Meeting. The convening of the Annual Shareholders Meeting and the reports and documents required by law for the Annual Shareholders Meeting, including the Annual Report, are published on the Company's Internet page together with the agenda and the explanation of the conditions of participation, shareholders' rights, and any countermotions and election proposals submitted by shareholders. The Company's financial calendar, which is published in the Annual Report, in the quarterly statements or financial reports, and on the Internet, regularly informs shareholders about important Company dates.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders may vote their shares themselves, through a proxy of their choice, or through a Company proxy who is required to follow the shareholder's voting instructions.\n\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, the 2022 E.ON SE Annual Shareholders Meeting as well was not held as an in -person event in order to protect the Company's shareholders and employees. Instead, in accordance with the law it was held as a virtual Annual\n\nShareholders Meeting without the physical participation of shareholders or their proxies.\n\nAs stipulated by German law, the Annual Shareholders Meeting votes to select the Company's independent auditor.\n\nOn May 19, 2021, the Annual Shareholders Meeting appointed KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, D\u00fcsseldorf, to audit the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report for the first quarter of 2022. On May 12, 2022, the Annual Shareholders Meeting appointed KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft to be indep endent auditor and Group independent auditor and to audit the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Reports for the 2022 financial year and the first quarter of the 2023 financial year. The Supervisory Board intends to recommend to the 2023 Annual Shareholders Meeting to appoint KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft to be independent auditor and Group independent auditor and to audit the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Reports for the 2023 financial year and the first quarter of the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Stipulation to Promote the Inclusion of Women and Men in Leadership Positions\n\nIn May 2017 the Management Board set a target quota for the proportion of women for E.ON SE regarding the composition of the first level of management below the Management Board of 30 percent and a quota of 35 percent for the second level of management below the Management Board, with an implementation deadline of June 30, 2022. At the time of the deadline, the proportion of women in first and second levels of management below the Management Board was 26.9 percent and 29.3 percent, respectively.\n\nE.ON has undertaken a variety of measures during the implementation period to increase the proportion of women in\n\nleadership positions. Examples include an in -house mentoring program and membership in the Initiative Women into Leadership ('IWiL') as well as, since the beginning of 2021, the option of a parttime leadership position and the promotion of co -leadership. This is an arrangement under which two part -time managers can share a leadership position and thus achieve a more flexible work -life balance. Another example is that E.ON's recruitment policy for management positions was adjusted so that the short list should include at least one candidate of the underrepresented gender.\n\nDespite these specific measures, the targets have been achieved yet. The target of 30 percent for the first management level below the Management Board was achieved at the end of both 2019 and 2020. However, the total number of positions at this management level is small. Even minor changes -like departures or the elimination of individual positions -therefore have a significant impact in percentage terms. As a result, E.ON has recorded a lower proportion of women at this level since year -end 2021.\n\nAfter setting the target in 2017, E.ON recorded a significant decline in the proportion of women for E.ON SE at the second management level below the Management Board in 2018 because of organizational effects. Since then, the proportion of women at this level has increased to 29.3 percent.\n\nE.ON aims to continually increase the proportion of women at all levels. In addition, the targets for the Group as a whole are among our longterm targets relevant for executive compensation. In February 2022 the Management Board adopted new target quotas of 36 percent for the proportion of women regarding appointments to both the first and second management levels below the Management Board. The implementation deadline is June 30, 2027.\n\nThe E.ON SE Management Board has recommended to those E.ON Group companies that are legally obligated to set targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory board, management board, and the next two levels of management that they select",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## Compensation Report\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nThis Compensation Report describes the basic features and design of the compensation for the E.ON SE Management Board and Supervisory Board. It was prepared by the E.ON SE Management Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with the requirements of Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (known by its German abbreviation, 'AktG') and complies with the recommendations as well as the suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (known by its German abbreviation, 'DCGK').\n\nThe Compensation Report and the report on the formal and substantive audit of the Compensation Report by KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft can be found on E.ON's Internet page.\n\nThe figures presented in the tables of the Compensation Report may not add up precisely due to rounding. The same applies to the percentages shown, which may not represent the exact absolute figures due to rounding .\n\n## II. Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nThe Compensation Report provides you with detailed insights into all relevant aspects and facts regarding the compensation of the Management Board and Supervisory Board for the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn the following, I summarize the most important compensation -related events of the past financial year .\n\n## Business Performance and Management Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year\n\nWe introduced a new compensation system from January 1, 2022, onward. This system was approved by 92.56 percent at the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting. This system links the compensation of the members of the Management Board even more closely to E.ON's business performance, in particular by strengthening long -term performance -based compensation as well as the strategically relevant performance criteria and promotes our Company's long -term performance.\n\nE.ON had a successful 2022 financial year and surpassed its forecast for several earnings metrics. Adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac8.1 billion was above both the prior -year figure (\u20ac7.9 billion) and the forecast range of \u20ac7.6 to \u20ac7.8 billion. In addition, adjusted net income rose by 9 percent to \u20ac2.7 billion and, thus surpassed the forecast range of \u20ac2.3 to \u20ac2.5 billion. Earnings per share (EPS), which are based on adjusted net income, amounted to \u20ac1.05 in the year under review (prior year: \u20ac0.96). The positive earnings performance relative to the prior year was to a lar ge degree due to the core business. At the network business it resulted from different effects, including cost savings, the leveraging of synergies, and further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments. The increase at Customer Solutions was generated primarily by the sales business as well as the EIS business. The main factors in the positive earnings performance were relatively mild weather, a significant reduction in customer churn amid the energy crisis, and the leveraging of synergies. As a result of EPS and Net Promoter Score (NPS) achieved in the 2022 financial year as well as individual performance, the target achievement of the 2022 bonus for Management Board members is 157 percent.\n\nThe third tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan (2019 -2023), which ended at the conclusion of the 2022 financial year and will be paid out in the 2023 financial year, was calculated pursuant to the old compensation system exclusively on the basis of the per formance of E.ON's total shareholder return (TSR) compared\n\nwith the TSR performance of the companies in the STOXX\u00ae Europe 600 Utilities. For the third tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan, the target achievement in the relative TSR performance and the absolute share price performance result in a payout of 117 percent of the target amount .\n\n## Approval of the Compensation Report 2021\n\nAs a result of the changes in regulatory requirements brought about by the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders' Rights Direc tive (known by its German abbreviation, 'ARUG II'), the Compensation Report was for the first time submitted to the 2022 Annual Shareholders Meeting for approval. The Annual Shareholders Meeting approved the Compensation Report for the 2021 financial year by 89.25 percent of the votes. The Supervisory Board subsequently considered the feedback from shareholders and proxy advisors received as part of the consultative vote on the Compensation Report. In addition to much positive feedback due to the high level of detail and transparency, individual investors and proxy advisors expressed criticism on the compensation system applied in the 2021 financial year. It should be noted that the compensation system introduced in 2017 was applied for the last time in the 2021 financial year. The new compensation system implemented in the 2022 financial year addresses a large number of the points of criticism. In addition, the transparency in the reporting of the EPS target value was increased further.\n\n## Entry into Force of the New Compensation System for the Management Board\n\nThe new compensation system has been applied for all Management Board members since January 1, 2022. It takes account of the changed legal requirements under ARUG II and the current recommendations of the DCGK. In addition, the new compensation system is even more strongly linked to E.ON's corporate strategy and the associated corporate objectives. It establishes clear incentives for successful and sustainable corporate governance and thus continues to promote the Company's long -term development. The most important",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192 IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## Adjustment of Management Board Compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board firmly believes that the members of the Management Board are already intrinsically highly motivated to lead E.ON into a successful future. Nevertheless, competitive Management Board compensation is of great importance in order to attract and retain the best possible candidates as members of the Management Board. This is particularly true in view of the extraordinary and continually evolving challenges in the energy market as well as E.ON's vital role in enabling the successful implementation of the energy transition in Europe.\n\nIn the course of the implementation of the new compensation system in Management Board members' service agreements, the Supervisory Board also dealt with the compensation levels and ratios of the individual compensation components. The analysis was based on a variety of aspects, including in particular the development of Management Board compensation, the Company's situation, the development of employee compensation as well as the competitiveness of Management Board compensation. As a result of careful consideration of the findings of this analysis and related extensive discussions, the Supervisory Board was of the opinion that an adjustment of Management Board compensati on as of January 1, 2022, had become necessary. In order to reflect the clear pay -for -performance concept as a central principle of Management Board compensation at E.ON, the compensation adjustment was made with the clear intent of placing greater emphasis on variable compensation in general and long -term variable compensation in particular. For more information and background on the adjustment of Management Board compensation, please refer to the 'Compensation Governance' section.\n\n## Composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThere were no personnel changes on the Management Board in the 2022 financial year. The appointment and service agreement of Management Board Chairman Leonhard Birnbaum were extended by five additional years to June 30, 2 028.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe (as of June 30, 2022) and Monika Krebber (as of March 31, 2022) ended their service on the Supervisory Board during the financial year. Katja Bauer and Anke Groth were appointed to the Supervisory Board as their successors .\n\n## Supervisory Board Compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board's compensation system was submitted to the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting for resolution and confirmed by it with 99.31 percent of votes in favor. The amount and system of Supervisory Board compensation remained unchanged in the 2022 financial year.\n\nWe stand by our objective of providing you with comprehensive transparency on the compensation of the E.ON Management Board and Supervisory Board and look forward to your support on this topic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKarlLudwig Kley\n\nChairman of the E.ON SE Supervisory Board",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192 IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## III. Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Fin ancial Year\n\nThe compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 financial year is presented and disclosed in detail below.\n\n## 1. Compensation Governance\n\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole is responsible for determining the compensation system as well as the amount and structure of Management Board compensation. The compensation system for the members of the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 87, Paragraph 1, and Section 87a, Paragraph 1 AktG on the basis of a proposal by the Executive Committee. After the Supervisory Board passes this resolution, the compensation system is submitted to the Annual Shareholders Meeting for approval.\n\nThe new compensation system for the Management Board resolved by the Supervisory Board on March 23, 2021, and approved by the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting has applied since January 1, 2022.\n\nFurthermore, for the respective upcoming financial year, the Supervisory Board sets the target values used to measure the Management Board's performance for the performance criteria that are applied in the financial year.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board sets the specific target compensation for the members of the Management Board. In setting Management Board members' compensation, the Supervisory Board ensures, in accordance with Section 87, Paragraph 1 AktG, that it is commensurate with the duties of the individual Management Board member, their individual performance, and the Company's economic situation, and that it does not exceed the customary compensation without special reasons. Furthermore, when setting the compensation, the Supervisory Board ensures that the compensation structure is\n\ngear ed towards the Company's sustainable and long -term development.\n\nWith the Executive Committee's support, the Supervisory Board reviews the appropriateness of Management Board members' compensation on a regular basis. In assessing the appropriateness of Management Board compensation, a horizontal comparison is made with the compensation paid to Management Board members of comparable companies. The DAX\u00ae companies are used as a peer group for this purpose due to their comparable size and governance structures as well as in view of the regulatory requirements and local market practice. Since September 20, 2021, the peer group therefore consists of 40 companies. In addition, a vertical comparison of compensation within E.ON is also carried out, taking into account the ratio of Management Board compensation to that of the Company's executives and the rest of its workforce. Both the current ratio and the change in the ratio over time are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nIn the course of the implementation of the new compensation system, the Supervisory Board also dealt with the compensation levels and ratios of the individual compensation components. The analysis of the compensation levels was conducted on the basis of the following aspects:\n\n## The Company's Situation and Special Challenges in the Energy Market\n\nE.ON's business performance over the last few years has been positive. The Company's situation is good and stable, even in a complex energy policy and economic environment. E.ON has consistently increased its dividend since the 2016 financial year and, in November 2021, pledged continuous dividend growth of up to 5 percent per year. In addition, the foundations for a comprehensive strategic realignment of the business have been laid in recent years, among others with the spinoff of Uniper and the integration of innogy, which was completed in June 2020. The new E.ON strategy published in the fall of 2021 with its three\n\ndimensions sustainability, digitalization, and growth is being systematically concretized and implemented.\n\nOverall, many new challenges have arisen for E.ON over the last few years, especially also in the current situation of the global energy crisis, that have made the business environment considerably more complex. This has led to a significant increase in Management Board members' responsibilities and tasks, also in connection with successfully shaping the energy transition in Europe.\n\n## Development of Management Board Compensatio n\n\nThe last general adjustment to the compensation level of the Management Board took place more than ten years ago. Such a long period of a constant compensation level is unusual in the market. It is customary to adjust Management Board compensation on a regular basis and in much shorter intervals based on various factors, such as the Company's performance and the development of employee compensation as well as developments in the market.\n\n## Development of Employee Compensation\n\nAdjustments to the compensation of senior executives as well as other employees of E.ON have taken place at regular intervals in recent years. These compensation adjustments are based on the Company's business situation and take into account market trends and other economic indicators. On balance, over the last ten years prior to the decision on the adjustment, the compensation of the workforce (employee groups: covered by tariff agreements, not covered by tariff agreements, and management, including senior executives) was increased by around 23 percent.",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192\n- IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## Competitiveness\n\n## Findings of the Analysis and Conclusion\n\nCompetitive compensation is of central importance to attracting and retaining the best possible candidates as Management Board members. In the course of the annual review of compensation levels and structure, in which the Supervisory Board was supported by an independent external compensation expert, it became apparent that the level of Management Board compensation to date and also the relative proportion of long -term variable compensation in particular compared with the relevant peer group were significantly below the customary level for comparable companies, both for the Management Board Chairman and for the ordinary Management Board members.\n\nThe relevant peer group for E.ON is composed of the largest publicly listed companies in Germany. In addition, the level of Management Board compensation is mainly influenced by the respective local market practice and applicable regulations. For this reason, the DAX\u00ae companies are used as the peer group, as described above. After comprehensive review, the Supervisory Board considers the use of an international peer group as the primary comparative market to be inappropriate, in particular in view of the different governance structures.\n\nOn the basis of size criteria (revenues, employees, and market capitalization) at the time of the review of compensation levels, E.ON positioned itself at the 65th percentile; that is, approximately at the lower edge of the upper third of the comparative market. The placement in the comparative market based on size criteria ensures that compensation reflects E.ON's size in the relevant comparative market.\n\nIn contrast, the Management Board Chairman's previous target direct compensation (base salary, target amount annual bonus, and target amount E.ON Performance Plan) was at the 33rd percentile and thus significantly below the size -derived position, while ordinary Management Board members' previous target direct compensation was at the 30th percentil e.\n\nBased on the analysis of compensation levels carried out and the aspects presented, after extensive deliberations and discussion, the Supervisory Board resolved to adjust the Management Board Chairman's target direct compensation to \u20ac5.375 million and that of ordinary Management Board members to \u20ac2.82 million effective January 1, 2022. The maximum compensation remains unchanged.\n\nThe Management Board Chairman's new target direct compensation is at the 53rd percentile and that of ordinary Management Board members is at the 64th percentile of the comparative market. The new target direct compensation thus remains below E.ON's size position .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\nThe adjustments focus in particular on increasing the target amount of the E.ON Performance Plan, which under the new Management Board compensation system is even more aligned with long -term and sustainable business development through the implementation of the E.ON Sustainability Index and the addition of ROCE. For this reason, from the 2022 financial year onward the E.ON Performance Plan will account for a significantly higher proportion of target direct compensation than before, further strengthening the notion of pay -for -performance.

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 2. Basic Features of Management Board Compensation\n\nE.ON aims to strengthen and expand its leading position in the European energy market. The objective is to shape the new energy world, which is increasingly characterized by autonomous and proactive customers, and to be their leading partner. In this conte xt, E.ON's strong performance culture in the interests of its various stakeholders is to be further promoted and anchored.\n\n## Principles of Management Board Compensation\n\nManagement Board compensation represents an important governance element for implementing the corporate strategy and creates incentives for achieving the objectives that have been set. The compensation of the Management Board is linked to E.ON's performance to a high degree and has a clear pay -for -performance orientation.\n\nIn designing and determining the Management Board compensation, the Supervisory Board follows in particular the following principles:\n\n| Principle                               | Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Promote the corporate strategy          | The Management Board's compensation is closely linked to the strategy of E.ON via defined targets for variable compensation and thus promotes  the Company's business strategy.                                                                                                                                      |\n| Conformity with regulatory requirements | Management Board compensation fulfills all requirements of the AktG and follows the current recommendations of the DCGK.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Appropriateness of the compensation     | Management Board compensation is appropriate from a horizontal perspective in comparison with competitors as well as from a vertical  perspective in an internal comparison with other employees.                                                                                                                    |\n| Pay- for - performance                  | The majority of the compensation consists of performance - based compensation components that are especially geared to the Company's success  by means of setting ambitious targets.                                                                                                                                 |\n| Long- term business development         | To reinforce the long - term aspect, performance - based compensation is predominantly assessed on a multi - year basis.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Sustainability                          | E.ON's sustainability strategy is anchored in the Management Board's compensation system, in particular by means of the E.ON Sustain ability  Index.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Consideration of shareholder interests  | In order to align management's and shareholders' interests and objectives, long - term variable compensation is based not only on the performance  of E.ON's share price in absolute terms but also on a comparison with competitors. Share ownership guidelines further strengthen the capital  market orientation. |",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192 IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 3. Management Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year in Detail\n\n## 3.1. NonPerformance -Based Compensation\n\nNonperformance -based compensation consists of a base salary, fringe benefits, and a pension substitute.\n\n## 3.1.1. Base Salary\n\nManagement Board members receive their fixed compensation in twelve identical monthly payments.\n\n## 3.1.2. Fringe Benefits\n\nManagement Board members receive a number of contractual fringe benefits, including the use of a chauffeur -driven company car. The Company also provides them with the necessary telecommunications equipment, covers costs that include those for a periodic medical examination, and pays the premium for an accident insurance policy. In addition, as part of the changeover to the pension substitute, the previous risk coverage by means of the supplementary amount in the event of disability or death will be continued as a fringe benefit.\n\n## 3.1.3. Pension Substitute\n\nSince the beginning of the 2022 financial year, Management Board members receive a lump -sum, earmarked pension substitute, to be paid out annually. The amount of the pension substitute is defined in individual contractual provisions and is not linked to any other compensation components. The introduction of the pension substitute ended the company pension scheme granted to Management Board members until the end of the 2021 financial year under the 'Contribution Plan E.ON Management Board.' Pension entitlements already acquired under the 'Contribution Plan E.ON Management Board' shall remain in force, but will not increase further.\n\nThe change to a pension substitute has significant advantages for the Company. Pension provision and investment risk are transferred to the Management Board member. This eliminates longterm financing through the creation of accruals and thus the risk for the Company. In order to ensure a fair change for Management Board members in view of the benefits for the Company, the amount of the pension substitute -\u20ac560,000 for the Management Board Chairman and \u20ac350,000 for ordinary Management Board members -was determined taking into account the contributions made by the Company up to and including the 2021 financial year under the previously valid 'Contribution Plan E.ON Management Board,' which were equal to\n\n21 percent of pensionable income (base salary and target annual bonus). With regard to these contributions by the Company, it should be noted that in the previous compensation reporting the service cost for the company pension plan was presented in accordance with IAS 19. This is an accounting figure that is based on actuarial methods, fluctuates with the underlying assumptions (in particular the actuarial interest rate) and therefore differs from the contribution made in the past. The pension substitute is also taken into account in the assessment of the app ropriateness of the compensation level of Management Board members.\n\nThe service cost and present value of the existing pension entitlements as of December 31, 2022, are as follows for each member of the Management Board:\n\n## Pension Entitlements in \u20ack\n\n|                   | IAS 19 Present value   | IAS 19 Present value    |\n|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                   | Service cost           | of pension  entitlement |\n| Leonhard Birnbaum | 0                      | 2,317                   |\n| Thomas K\u00f6nig      | 0                      | 2,609                   |\n| Patrick Lammers   | 0                      | 178                     |\n| Victoria Ossadnik | 0                      | 750                     |\n| Marc Spieker      | 0                      | 867                     |",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 3.2. Performance -Based Compensation\n\nPerformance -based compensation accounts for the majority of Management Board members' compensation. It consists of the annual bonus (short -term incentive, STI) and the E.ON Performance Plan (long -term incentive, LTI), which have terms of one and four years, respectively. The target amount of the annual bonus accounts for 36 percent of performance -based compensation, the target amount of the E.ON Performance Plan for 64 percent. By basing variable compensation predominantly on a multi -year metric, the Supervisory Board ensures the promotion of E.ON's sustainable and long -term development.\n\nThe pay -for -performance concept of Management Board compensation represents a key principle of Management Board compensation. Alongside target direct compensation's high proportion of variable compensation (about 73 percent for the Management Board Chairman, about 72 percent for ordinary Management Board members), the Supervisory Board ensures this by setting ambitious performance criteria. The Supervisory Board defines these criteria for the annual bonus and for the E.ON Performance Plan prior to the start of each financial year and the start of each tranche, respectively, thereby incentivizing operational as well as strategic corporate goals.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the pay -for -performance concept of Management Board compensation in light of three performance scenarios:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 3.2.1. Annual Bonus\n\nThe annual bonus (STI) consists of a cash payment made after the end of the financial year. Its amount is based on the achievement of predefined performance criteria. These measure both company performance and individual performance using an individual per formance factor. The bonus is capped at a maximum of 180 percent of the contractually agreed -on target bonus (cap). Its payout is calculated as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## Company -Performance\n\nThe performance criteri a for company performance are EPS, E.ON's key performance indicator, with a weighting of 80 percent, as well as a non -financial performance indicator, NPS for the 2022 financial year, with a weighting of 20 percent.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nEPS used for this purpose is derived from adjusted net income as disclosed in the Annual Report. EPS is used to incentivize E.ON's operating success. In this context, the Company's attractiveness is to be further enhanced through dividend growth. This objective is also supported by an ambitious EPS targ et.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe EPS target for each financial year is set by the Supervisory Board, taking into account the approved budget. The target achievement is 100 percent if actual EPS is equal to the target. If actual EPS is 37.5 percent or more below the target, this constitutes zero percent target achievement. If actual EPS is 37.5 percent or more above the target, this constitutes 200 percent target achievement. Linear interpolation is used to translate intermediate EPS figures into percentages. The target for the 20 22 financial year was \u20ac0.87.\n\nEPS, which is based on adjusted net income, amounted to \u20ac1.05 in the year under review. The positive earnings performance relative to the prior year was to a large degree due to the core business. At the network business it resulted from different effects, including cost savings, the leveraging of synergies, and further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments. The increase at Customer Solutions was generated primarily by the sales business as well as the EIS business. The main factors in the positive earnings performance were relatively mild weather, a significant reduction in customer churn amid the energy crisis, and the leveraging of synergies.\n\nThis results in a target achievement of 155 percent.\n\n## Net P romoter Score\n\nAttracting new customers and retaining existing ones are crucial to E.ON's business success. As a customer -oriented company, E.ON wants to continually increase customer satisfaction and become the number one energy solutions provider in its markets. For this purpose, NPS serv ing as a key performance indicator for measuring company performance, is taken into account. E.ON uses NPS to measure the trust and loyalty of its customers. NPS indicates whether they would recommend E.ON to others. The target is set on the basis of strategic NPS (sNPS) as well as journey NPS (jNPS).\n\nsNPS compares the willingness of E.ON customers to recommend E.ON with the willingness of competitor's customers and is measured for both the 'residential customers' segment and the 'small and medium -sized enterprises' segment. The total score is determined on a weighted basis for each country. The unweighted average score across the countries is then calculated from these sNPS totals. The targets are set by the Supervisory Board at the beginning of the financial year, with the ambition level guided by the previous year's performance. Target achievement is 100 percent if the actual value achieved corresponds to the target value set by the Supervisory Board.\n\njNPS measures the willingness of customers per country to recommend E.ON to others after they have completed a certain series of interactions (known as journeys) with E.ON. The success of journeys is measured according to existing E.ON minimum requirements.\n\nThe determination of the NPS targets is based in each case on the target achievement of the previous year and refers to the following system:\n\nThe aim for sNPS is for E.ON customers' willingness to recommend the Company to improve more than that of competitor's customers. If sNPS achieved in the prior year for E.ON is behind the competitive average or at the same level, the target for the financial year is to reduce the gap by 3 points or to achieve a positive gap of 3 points. If prior -year sNPS for E.ON is slightly above the competition average, the gap is to be widened by 2 points. If the gap to the competition is clearly positive (at least 15 points), the gap must be maintained. If E.ON's sNPS in the prior year is 20 or more points above the competition average, a gap of 2 0 points is considered the target value .",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\nThe target ambition for jNPS is also based on the prior -year performance. If jNPS for a journey is equal to or below -20 for the prior year, an improvement of 15 points is considered to be an achieved target level. If jNPS is between -19 and +39, the improvement must be at least 8 points or reach an absolute score of +40. For score in the prior year of +40 or above, a score of +40 is considered the target value. The number of journeys at target level determines the degree of target achievement.\n\nTarget achievement is measured on a country -specific basis and overall target achievement is determined on the basis of a simple average across all E.ON countries. For the 2022 financial year, the simple average target achievement across all countries is 94 percent based on the defined target achievement curves.\n\nConsidering target achievement for the performance criterion EPS yields a total company performance of 143 percent .\n\n## Individual Performance Factor\n\nThe targets for individual performance factors are set by the Supervisory Board before the beginning of each financial year. The Supervisory Board has the option of defining both collective and individual targets for the individual performance factor. In particu lar, the Supervisory Board is guided by focus topics -such as the further development of the strategy, transformation projects, digitalization, operating targets, and so forth -from which it can set annual priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The performance criteria are relative TSR with a weighting of 50 percent and ROCE and the E.ON Sustainability Index with a weighting of 25 percent each.\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return\n\nThe centerpiece of the corporate strategy is sustainable growth in Company value. For this reason, the E.ON Performance Plan's total target achievement is measured with a weighting of 50 percent by relative total shareholder return. Taking TSR into account further\n\naligns the interests and objectives of management and shareholders. TSR is the return of the E.ON share, which takes into account the share price plus the assumption of reinvested dividends, adjusted for changes in capital.\n\nTSR measures E.ON's performance in comparison with competitors. The companies of the STOXX\u00ae Europe 600 Utilities sector index are used as the peer group. Companies that are subject of ongoing takeover proceedings or in which E.ON holds a significant stake (at least 30 percent) are not included.",

Target achievement can be between 0 percent and 200 percent and results from the percentile reached as follows:\n\n## Return on Capital Employed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an internal financial performance criterion, ROCE is considered with a weighting of 25 percent. ROCE is a long -term key performance indicator geared toward sustainable performance and an important component of E.ON's management system. Considering ROCE places a long -term focus on sustainable company development and on the efficiency of the investments required for it. Before the start of each tranche, the Supervisory Board sets target values for each year of the four -year performance period on the basis of long -term strategic planning, as well as lower and upper limits for the maximum relative deviation from the target value (lower threshold and upper threshold), taking into account the cost of capital for the entire performance period. Target achievement is determined on the basis of the deviation of ROCE actually achieved from the target value on the basis of the target achievement curve below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter the end of the performance period of the sixth tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan, the target values set by the Supervisory Board for the ROCE performance criterion will be disclosed ex -post in the Compensation Report.",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## E.ON Sustainability Index\n\nGood corporate governance, the fulfillment of social and societal responsibilities, and the preservation of natural resources are essential for E.ON to generate sustainable economic value in the long term. These principles are anchored in the sustainabilit y strategy and are reflected in Management Board's compensation system by the E.ON Sustainability Index, which has a weighting of 25 percent in the E.ON Performance Plan. It includes the four most relevant environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects at E.ON. Currently these are: climate action, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, and ESG ratings. All ESG aspects are backed by\n\ncomprehensible and measurable targets. Before the start of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines the specific target values for each target and the respective target achievement curves for the entire performance period. Depending on target achievement, up to 50 points are awarded for each target, meaning that a total of 200 points can be achieved. Target achievement for the E.ON Sustainability Index can range from 0 percent to 200 percent (cap) and is calculated based on the total points achieved at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe following targets have been set for the 2022 tranche:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter the end of the p erformance period of the sixth tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan, an ex -post disclosure will be made in the Compensation Report on the actual results achieved and the resulting target achievement .\n\nTotal target achievement of the E.ON Performance Plan is calculated as a weighted average of the target achievements for each performance criterion, but cannot exceed 150 percent. The payout amount is determined by multiplying the number of virtual shares at the end of the performance period on the basis of the target achievement by the average price of E.ON share in the last 60 days prior to the end of the performance period and adding the dividends per share distributed on E.ON share during the performance period. The payout is capped at 200 percent of the contractually agreedon target amount .\n\n## Outlook 2023\n\nIn determining the targets for the seventh tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan (2023 -2026), the Supervisory Board remains with the ESG aspects as already included in the E.ON Sustainability Index of the sixth tranche and continues with the targets r eduction of carbon emissions ( Scope 1&2), proportion of female executives, reduction of frequency of severe incidents and fatalities as well as stable results in three relevant ESG ratings.",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192\n- IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 3.3. M aximum C ompensation\n\nTo ensure appropriate compensation for Management Board members, compensation is capped in two ways. First, caps are defined for the performance -based compensation components. These are 180 percent of the target amount for the annual bonus and 200 percent of the target amount for the E.ON Performance Plan.\n\nIn addition to the caps on the individual performance -based compensation components, the Supervisory Board has set maximum compensation as defined in Section 87a, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2, Number 1 AktG. This limits the total amount of all compensation paid out for a financial year; that is, non -performance -based and performance -based components, including all fringe benefits as well as the pension substitute, regardless of the payout date. The maximum compensation for the Management Board Chairman is \u20ac10 million and for ordinary Management Board members, \u20ac5.5 million each.\n\nCompliance with maximum compensation is reviewed at the end of each financial year. However, final compliance with maximum compensation for a financial year can only be reported after the end of the performance period of the last compensation component to be paid out (E.ON Performance Plan). Compliance with maximum compensation for the 2022 financial year can therefore only be reported eventually at the end of the performance period of the tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan granted in the 2022 financial year; that is, in the Compensation Report for the 2025 financial year.\n\n## 3.4. Share Ownership Guidelines\n\nTo strengthen the capital -market focus and equity culture, share ownership guidelines as effective from 2017 onwards apply to Management Board members. The guidelines obligate Management Board members to invest in E.ON shares equaling 200 percent of base salary (for the Management Board Chairman) and 150 percent of base salary (for the other Management Board members) and to prove this. The introduction of the new compensation system, effective January 1, 2022, obligates\n\nManagement Board members not only to fulfil their share ownership requirement until the end of their appointment to t he Management Board, but also for two additional years after leaving the Management Board. Until the required investment is reached, Management Board members are obligated to invest amounts equivalent to the net payouts from their long -term variable compensation in actual E.ON share. The degree of fulfillment of the shareholding requirements of the individual Management Board members can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Share Ownership Guidelines\n\n|                    | Member of the  Management  Board since   |   in % of base salary | Target in \u20ack   | in \u20ack   |   Status quo  December 31,  2022 in % of base salary |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leonhard Birnbaum  | July 1, 2013                             |                   200 | 2,880          | 2,890   |                                                  201 |\n| Thomas K\u00f6nig       | June 1, 2018                             |                   150 | 1,200          | 1,260   |                                                  158 |\n| Patrick Lammers    | August 1, 2021                           |                   150 | 1,200          | 487     |                                                   61 |\n| Victoria  Ossadnik | April 1, 2021                            |                   150 | 1,200          | 151     |                                                   19 |\n| Marc Spieker       | January 1, 2017                          |                   150 | 1,200          | 1,437   |                                                  180 |",

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192\n- IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 3.5. Malus and Clawback Provisions\n\nThe malus and clawback provisions apply to all Management Board members with the entry into effect of the new compensation system on January 1, 2022. This gives the Supervisory Board the opportunity of reducing variable compensation that has not yet been paid out (malus) or of reclaiming variable compensation that has already been paid out (clawback).\n\nIn the case of intentional violations of material provisions of E.ON's internal Code of Conduct and/or material contractual obligations, or in the case of a material breach of the duty of care as defined in Section 93 AktG, the Supervisory Board may, at its reasonable discretion, partially or fully reduce to zero any variable compensation not yet paid out during the assessment period in which the violation occurred.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board has the opportunity of partially or fully reclaiming the gross amount of variable compensation already paid out (compliance clawback) if one of the aforementioned violations becomes known or is discovered. In addition, if variable compensation has been determined or paid out on the basis of incorrect Consolidated Financial Statements, the Supervisory Board may reclaim the difference determined on the basis of a corrected determination (performance clawback).\n\nClawback is excluded if the payout was made more than three years ago.\n\nOther claims of E.ON SE, in particular pursuant to Section 93, Paragraph 2 AktG, the right to revoke the appointment as defined in Section 84, Paragraph 4 AktG, and the right to terminate the service agreement without notice remain unaffected.\n\nNeither the malus nor the clawback provision was made use of in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 4. Compensation-Related Transactions\n\n## 4.1. Premature Termination of a Management Board Service Agreement\n\nOrdinary termination of the service agreement is excluded. The right of either party to terminate the service agreement for cause remains unaffected. In case of premature termination of the Management Board service agreement for good cause for which the Management Board member is responsible, the Management Board member has no claim to a severance payment for the remaining term. Furthermore, all tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan not yet paid out lapse without any compensation .\n\nIn the event of premature termination of the Management Board service agreement without good cause, the Management Board service agreements provide for a severance cap in line with the recommendation of the DCGK. According to this, payments in this context may not exceed two years' compensation and may not compensate for more than the remaining term of the service agreement. Total compensation for the past financial year and the expected total compensation for the current financial year in which the service agreement ends prematurely are used to calculate the severance payment cap.\n\nIn the event of premature termination of the Management Board service agreement due to permanent incapacity to work, the service agreement ends at the end of the sixth month following the month in which the permanent incapacity to work was established. In this case, the performance period of outstanding tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan, paid out on the basis of a closing share price determined at the premature end of the performance period, a dividend equivalent calculated prematurely, and a target achievement determined prematurely, also ends.\n\nIf a Management Board member dies during the term of the service agreement, the surviving spouse, or, alternatively, their legally dependent children, is entitled to continued payment of the\n\nbase salary and the target bonus for six months following the month of death. In addition, outstanding tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan are paid out on the basis of a closing share price determined at the premature end of the performance period, a dividend equivalent calculated prematurely, and a target achievement determined prematurely.\n\nNo severance payments were made in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 4.2. Change of Control\n\nIn the event of a premature loss of a Management Board position due to a change of control, Management Board members are entitled to severance payments. The change -of -control agreements stipulate that a change of control exists in three cases: a third party acquires at least 30 percent of the Company's voting rights, thus triggering the automatic requirement to make an offer for the Company pursuant to Germany's Stock Corporation Takeover Law; the Company, as a dependent entity, concludes a corporate agreement; the Company is merged with a non -affiliated company. Management Board members are entitled to a settlement payment if, within 12 months of the change of control, their service agreement is terminated by mutual consent, expires, or is terminated by them; in the latter case, however, only if their position on the Management Board is materially affected by the change of control. Management Board members' severance payment consists of their base salary and target bonus plus fringe benefits for two years after termination of their service agreements. In accordance with the DCGK, these severance payments are limited to the amount of the annual compensation for the remaining term of the service agreement.\n\nTotal compensation for the past financial year and the expected total compensation for the current financial year in which the service agreement ends prematurely are used to calculate the severance payment cap.",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 4.3. NonCompete Clause\n\nThe service agreements of Management Board members include a noncompete clause. For a period of six months after the termination of their service agreement, Management Board members are contractually prohibited from working directly or indirectly for a company that competes directly or indirectly with the Company or its affiliates. Management Board members receive a compensation payment for the period of the non -compete restriction. The prorated payment is based on 100 percent of their contractually stipulated annual target compensation (base salary and target bonus), but is, at a minimum, 60 percent of their most recently received contractually stipulated compensation.\n\nIn line with the DCGK's recommendations, other benefits owed by the Company for the period after termination of the service agreement, in particular a severance payment in the event of premature termination of the service agreement and company pension benefits, will instead be offset against this compensation.\n\nNo compensation payments were granted in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 5.

Compensation of the Management Board in the 2022 Financial Year\n- \u2192\n- IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Year \u2192 V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## 5.2. Compensation awarded and due in the financial year pursuant to Section 162 Akt G\n\nThe following presents the compensation awarded and due of the individual Management Board member in the 2022 financial year below pursuant to Section 162 AktG. Compensation aw arded and due consists of all compensation components earned as of the end of the financial year. This includes all compensation components for which performance has been fully carried out or for which performance measurement ends at the conclusion of the 2022 financial year even if payout does not take place until the 2023 financial year. Consequently, the 2022 bonus is disclosed under oneyear variable compensation even though payout did not take place until the start of the 2023 financial year. The same applies to the E.ON Performance Plan, whose third tranche, which ended at the conclusion of the 2022 financial year, is disclosed for the 2022 financial year even though payout did not take place until the start of the 2023 financial year. This disclosure approach presents transparently the relationship between the business results of a financial year and the resulting compensation.\n\nConsequently, compensation awarded and due in the 2022 financial year consists, pursuant to Section 162 AktG, of:\n\n- \u00b7 the base salary in the 2022 financial year,\n- \u00b7 the fringe benefits (including the continuation of risk coverage in the event of disability or death) in the 202 2 financial year,\n- \u00b7 the pension substitute in the 2022 financial year,\n- \u00b7 the 2022 annual bonus, which is paid in the 2023 financial year\n- \u00b7 the third tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan, that was granted in the 2019 financial year and ended at the conclusion of the 2022 financial year and is paid out in the 2023 financial year.\n\nDue to the change of the company pension scheme to a pension substitute, service cost no longer arises from the granting of contributions for the company pension scheme as of the 2022 financial year. Unlike the service cost, however, the pension substitute is recognized as compensation awarded and due.\n\nFor reasons of comparability, the service cost of pension entitlements in accordance with IAS 19 for the 2021 financial year is additionally shown in the tables under the compensation awarded and due pursuant to Section 162 AktG as part of Management Board compensation .\n\n## Compensation Awarded and Due in the Financial Year pursuant to Section 162 AktG\n\n|                                                           | Leonhard Birnbaum (Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer) Management Board member since July 1,  2013; Chairman since April 1, 2021   | Leonhard Birnbaum (Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer) Management Board member since July 1,  2013; Chairman since April 1, 2021   | Leonhard Birnbaum (Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer) Management Board member since July 1,  2013; Chairman since April 1, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                           |                                                                                                                                       | 2022                                                                                                                                  | 2021                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                           | in \u20ack                                                                                                                                 | in %                                                                                                                                  | in \u20ack                                                                                                                                 |\n| Base salary                                               | 1,440                                                                                                                                 | 27                                                                                                                                    | 1,115                                                                                                                                 |\n| Fringe benefits                                           | 74                                                                                                                                    | 1                                                                                                                                     | 14                                                                                                                                    |\n| Pension substitute                                        | 560                                                                                                                                   | 10                                                                                                                                    | -

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## IV. Supervisory Board Compensation in the 2022 Financial Y ear\n\nThe following first presents the Supervisory Board's compensation system and then the compensation awarded and due of the individual Supervisory Board members in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 1. Compensation System of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe compensation of Supervisory Board members is determined by the Annual Shareholders Meeting and governed by Section 15 of the Company's Articles of Association. The Supervisory Board's compensation system was submitted to the Annual Shareholders Meeting for resolution most recently in the 2021 financial year and confirmed.\n\nThe purpose of the compensation system is to enhance the Supervisory Board's independence for its oversight role. Furthermore, there are a number of duties that Supervisory Board members must perform irrespective of the Company's financial performance. Supervisory Board members, in addition to being reimbursed for their expenses, therefore receive fixed compensation and compensation for committee duties.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed compensation of \u20ac440,000; the Deputy Chairmen, \u20ac320,000. The other members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed compensation of \u20ac140,000. The Chairman of the Audit and Risk\n\nCommittee receives an additional \u20ac180,000; the members of the Audit and Risk Committee, an additional \u20ac110,000. Other committee chairmen receive an additional \u20ac140,000; committee members, an additional \u20ac70,000. Members serving on more than one committee receive the highest applicable committee compensation only. In contradistinction to the compensation just described, the Chairman and the Deputy Chairmen of the Supervisory Board receive no additional compensation for their committee duties. In addition, Supervisory Board members are paid an attendance fee of \u20ac1,000 per day for meetings of the Supervisory Board or its committees. Individuals who were members of the Supervisory Board or any of its committees for less than an entire financial year receive pro rata compensation.\n\n## 2. Individualized Disclosure of Supervisory Board Compensation\n\nThe compensation awarded and due to the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2022 financial year is broken down below into the individual compensation components pursuant to Section 162 AktG. In addition, the table contains the individual compensation components' relative share of total compensation.",

Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\n## V. Comparative Presentation of the Development of Compensation and Earnings\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Section 162, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2, Number 2 AktG, the following table shows the development of compensation for current and former members of the Management Board, Supervisory Board members, and employees compared with the Company's earnings development. The presentation of the annual changes will continue to be added in the reporting years ahead and will cover the full five -year period for the first time in the 2025 Compensation Report.\n\nFor the development of Management Board and Supervisory Board compensation, compensation awarded and due for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years will be taken into account in accordance with Section 162 AktG.\n\nFor the average employee compensation, the compensation of employees in Germany is considered analogously to the vertical assessment. For the development of average employee compensation, the regular target compensation as of the end of the financial year is taken into account, which was extrapolated to a 100 percent employment level in each case. In the 2022 financial year, 33,690 (202 1 : 3 4 ,409; 2020: 35,526) employees are included in the average.\n\nIn addition to E.ON SE's net income pursuant to the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: 'HGB'), EPS based on adjusted net income is used to present earnings development.",

On March 6 , 202 3 , the Board of Management of E.ON SE approved the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 202 2 , for publication.\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the E.ON Group ('E.ON' or the 'Group') are generally prepared at cost, with the exception of financial assets that are measured at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) and of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) that are recognized in income and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are shown in millions of euros (\u20ac million). For accounting reasons, rounding differences may occur. These financial statements relate to the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022. In accordan ce with IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements' ('IAS 1'), the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been prepared using a classified balance sheet structure. Assets that will be realized within 12 months of the reporting date, as well as liabilities that are due to be settled within one year of the reporting date are generally classified as current. The Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using\n\nthe nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal purposes.\n\n## Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial statements of E.ON SE and entities controlled by E.ON ('subsidiaries'). Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to influence those returns. Control is generally deemed established when a majority of the voting rights is held. An entity is a structured entit y if control is based on contractual arrangements or other legal relationships and is not reflected in a majority of voting rights.\n\nThe results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or until the date of their disposal, respectively.\n\nIf the issue of shares in subsidiaries or associates to third parties leads to a reduction in E.ON's ownership interest in these investees ('dilution'), and consequently to a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, gains and losses from these dilutive transactions are included in the income statement under other operating income or expenses.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the subsidiaries' financial statements to bring their accounting policies into line with those of the Group. Intercompany receivables, liabilities and results are eliminated in the consolidation process.\n\n## Associated Companies\n\nAn associate is an investee over whose financial and operati ng policy d ecisions E.ON has significant influence and that is not controlled by E.ON or jointly controlled with E.ON. Significant influence is presumed if E.ON directly or indirectly holds at least 20 percent, but not more than 50 percent, of an entity's voting\n\nrights. Interests in associated companies are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nInterests in associated companies accounted for using the equity method are reported on the balance sheet at cost, adjusted for changes in the Group's share of the net assets after the date of acquisition and for any impairment charges. Losses that might potentially exceed the Group's interest in an associated company when attributable long -term loans are taken into consideration are generally not recognized. Any difference between the cost of the investment and the pro rata remeasured value of its net assets is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as part of the carrying amount.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with associated companies accounted for using the equity method are eliminated within the consolidation process on a pro rata basis if they are material.\n\nCompanies accounted for using the equity method are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the carrying amount is adjusted for this difference. If the reasons for previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist, such impairment losses are reversed acc ordingly.\n\n## Joint Ventures\n\nJoint ventures are also accounted for using the equity method. Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with joint -venture companies are eliminated within the consolidation process on a pro rata basis if they are mater ial.\n\n## Joint Operations\n\nA joint operation exists when E.ON and other investors directly control an operation, but unlike a joint venture, they do not have a claim to the changes in net assets from the operation. Instead, they have direct rights to individual assets or direct obligations",

E.ON recognizes assets and liabilities as well as revenues and expenses in a joint operation pro rata according to the rights and obligations attributable to E.ON.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method, under which the purchase price is offset against the proportional share in the acquired company's net assets. The fair values are determined using published exchange or market prices at the time of acquisition in the case of marketable securities or commodities, for example, and in the case of land, buildings and major technical equipment, generally using independent expert reports that have been prepared by third parties. If exchange or market prices are unavailable for consideration, fair values are derived from market prices for comparable assets or comparable transactions. If these values are not directly observable, fair value is determined using appropri ate valuation methods. In such cases, E.ON determines fair value using the discounted cash flow method by discounting estimated future cash flows by a weighted -average cost of capital.\n\nNoncontrolling interests can be measured either at cost (partial goodwill method) or at fair value (full goodwill method). The choice of method can be made on a case -bycase basis. The partial goodwill method is generally used within the E.ON Group.\n\nIntangible assets must be recognized separately if they are cl early separable or if their recognition arises from a contractual or other legal right. Provisions for restructuring measures may not be recorded in a purchase price allocation. If the purchase price paid exceeds the proportional share in the net assets at the time of acquisition, the positive difference is recognized as goodwill. No goodwill is recognized for positive differences attributable to noncontrolling interests. A negative difference is recognized in net income.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe Company's transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the current exchange rate at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date monetary foreign currency items are adjusted to the exchange rate on the reporting date; any gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in the relevant currencies are recognized in net income and reported as other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively. Gains and losses from the translation of non -derivative financial instruments used in hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in equity as a component of other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is immediately recognized in net income.\n\nThe functional currency as well as the reporting currency of E.ON SE is the euro. The assets and liabilities of Group companies with a functional currency other than the euro are translated using the mid -market exchange rates applicable on the balance sheet date. The income statements of foreign Group companies with a functional currency other than the euro are translated using annual average exchange rates. Differences arising from the application of both rates are recognized directly in equity.\n\nThe following table depicts the movements in exchange rates for the periods indicated for major currencies of countries outside the European Monetary Union:\n\n## Currencies\n\n|                  | ISO   |   \u20ac1, rate at year-end |   \u20ac1, rate at year-end |   \u20ac1, annual average rate |   \u20ac1, annual average rate |\n|------------------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                  | Code  |                2022    |                2021    |                   2022    |                   2021    |\n| British pound    | GBP   |                   0.89 |                   0.84 |                      0.85 |                      0.86 |\n| Danish krone     | DKK   |                   7.44 |                   7.44 |                      7.44 |                      7.44 |\n| Norwegian krone  | NOK   |                  10.51 |                   9.99 |                     10.1  |                     10.16 |\n| Polish z\u0142oty     | PLN   |                   4.68 |                   4.6  |                      4.69 |                      4.57 |\n| Romanian leu     | RON   |                   4.95 |                   4.95 |                      4.93 |                      4.92 |\n| Swedish krona    | SEK   |                  11.12 |                  10.25 |                     10.63 |                     10.15 |\n| Czech crown      | CZK   |                  24.12 |                  24.86 |                     24.57 |                     25.64 |\n| Turkish lira     | TRY   |                  19.96 |                  15.23 |                     17.41 |                     10.51 |\n| Hungarian forint | HUF   |                 400.87 |                 369.19 |                    391.29 |                    358.52 |\n| US Dollar        | USD   |                   1.07 |                   1.13 |                      1.05 |                      1.18 |\n\nCountries classified as hyperinflationary are required by IAS 29 to express their financial statements in the functional currency of the hyperinflationary economy in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date to reflect current purchasing power. As a result, among other things, non -monetary assets and liabilities are generally adjusted using a general price index and a gain or loss on the net monetary position is recognized. For additional information on the application of IAS 29 in fiscal year 2022, please refer to Note 16.\n\n## Recognition of Income\n\n## a) Revenues\n\nRevenues are generated primarily from the sale of electricity and gas to retail customers, industrial and commercial customers and wholesale markets. For contracts that do not provide for defined purchase quantities, the performance obligation consists in particular in the provision and availability of energy on demand at any time. Revenues earned from the distribution of electricity and gas and from deliveries of steam and heat are also primarily",

E.ON makes the electricity and gas distribution network available to its customers . Since the introduction of IFRS 15 with effect from January 1, 2018, revenues no longer include the fees for the promotion of Renewables because these revenues are netted with the corresponding cost of materials (net disclosure).\n\nRevenues are generally recognized when E.ON fulfills its performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is deemed to be transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset. The majority of the E.ON Group's revenues are recognized over time because customers use these services when they are provided. For all such revenues, progress is measured using output -based methods. Progress is generally measured on a straight -line basis with variable charges allocated to specific performance components. The methods used appropriately reflect the pattern of transfer of goods to customers or provision of services for customers. The relatively subordinate point-intime revenue recognition occurs primarily in the 'Build & Sell' segment and for so -called linear products, where a fixed amount of energy is provided to commercial customers at a specific point in time. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which means that no significant discretionary decisions are required.\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods and services are measured using the transaction prices allocated to these goods and services. They reflect the value of the volume supplied, including an estimated value of the volume supplied to customers between the date of the last invoice and the end of the period. Monthly advance payments for B2C customers are generally determined on the basis of historical consumption data, taking into account current temperature effects, and peak payments are settled at the end of the settlement period. In B2B, a bottom -up approach is used to calculate individual rates. E.ON's sales transactions generally are not based on any material finance components. The average target payment period is generally between 10 and 30 days, in exceptional cases longer. Refunds to customers are an exception\n\nand are granted if the customer is disconnected from the power supply for an extended period of time. Cash bonuses or bonus payments to customers are recognized as refund liabilities and presented as a decrease in revenues uniformly over the term of the contract. As a rule, no warranties are granted in the Core Business. Warranties are only granted in the 'Build & Sell' activities.\n\n## b) Interest Income\n\nInterest income is recognized pro rata using the effective interest method.\n\n## c) Dividend Income\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive the distribution payment arises.\n\n## Electricity and Energy Taxes\n\nElectricity and energy taxes are levied on electricity and natural gas delivered to retail customers and are calculated on the basis of a fixed tax rate per kilowatt -hour ('kWh'). This rate varies between different classes of customers. Electricity and energy taxes payable are deducted from sales revenues on the face of the income statement if those taxes are levied upon delivery of energy to the retail customer.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic (undiluted) earnings per share is computed by dividing the consolidated net income attributable to the shareholders of the parent company by the weighted -average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the relevant period. At E.ON, the computation of diluted earnings per share is identical to that of basic earnings per share because E.ON SE has issue d no potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The increase in the weighted -average number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the issue of treasury shares in E.ON SE under the voluntary employee stock purchase program.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at the cash -generating unit level on at least an annual basis. The term cash -generating unit also always includes groups of cash -generating units and is referred to in simplified form as a cash -generating unit. Goodwill must also be tested for impairment at the level of individual cash -generating units if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of a particular cash -generating unit might be impaired. Impairment tests must also be performed between these annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective cash -generating unit might not be recoverable.\n\nNewly created goodwill is allocated to those cash -generating units expected to benefit from the respective business combination. The cash -generating units to which goodwill is allocated are generally equivalent to the operating segments, since goodwill is reported, and considered in performance metrics for controlling, only at that level. If goodwill cannot be allocated arbitrarily to individual cash -generating units but instead can only be allocated to groups of cash -generating units, the lowest level within the unit at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes then includes several cash -generating units to which the goodwill relates but to which it cannot be allocated individually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed in euros, while the underlying goodwill is always carried in the functional currency.\n\nIn a first step, E.ON determines the recoverable amount of a cash -generating unit on the basis of the fair value (less costs to sell) using generally accepted valuation procedures. This is based on the medium -term planning data of the respective cash -generating unit. Valuation is performed using the discounted cash flow method unless market transactions or valuations prepared by third parties for comparable assets which are higher -level in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13 are available. If needed, a calculation of value in use is also performed.",

Factors such as typical product life cycles and legal or similar limits on use are taken into account in the classification.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets subject to amortization are related to software and are recognized as development costs. Intangible assets subject to amortization are generally amortized using the straight -line method over their expected useful lives. The useful lives of customer relationships and similar assets range between 2 and 50 years, and between 3 and 50 years for concessions, industrial property rights, licenses and similar rights, unless depreciation based on use reflects an appropriate level of depletion. This latter category includes software in particular. Useful lives and amortization methods are subject to r egular verification. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired.\n\nIntangible assets not subject to amortization or intangible assets whose use has not yet started are not amortized. An impairment test is carried out at least once a year as well as whenever there are indications of impairment, either for the individual asset or at\n\nthe level of the cash -generating unit. The useful life of an intangibl e asset with an indefinite life is tested annually to determine whether the indefinite life assumption continues to be justified.\n\nBoth assets with definite and indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount -the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use -is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment losses previously recognized under depreciation, amortization and impairment charges no longer apply, these assets are written up to a maximum of the value tha t would have resulted if no impairment losses had been recognized during the preceding periods, taking into account scheduled depreciation.\n\nSee Note 15 for additional information about goodwill an d intangible assets.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nUnder IFRS, expenditure on research is expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the development phase of new products, services and technologies are to be recognized as assets when the general criteria for recognition specified in IAS 38 are present. In the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, E.ON capitalized costs for internally generated software and other technologies in this context.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially measured at acquisition or production cost, including decommissioning or restoration cost that must be capitalized, and are depreciated over the expected useful lives of the components, generally using the straight -line method, unless a different method of depreciation is deemed more suitable in certain exceptional cases. Useful lives are regularly tested for appropriateness and the underlying assumptions and estimates are updated, for example, in view of technical, economic or legal circumstances.\n\nThe useful lives of the most significant asset classes of material property, plant and equipment are presented below:\n\n## Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\n\n| Buildings                                                  | 5 to 60 years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Technical equipment, plant and machinery                   | 2 to 80 years   |\n| Other equipment, fixtures, furniture and office  equipment | 2 to 30 years   |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In such a case, property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment according to the principles prescribed for intangible assets in IAS 36. If the reasons for the impairment losses previously recognized under depreciation, amortization and impairment charges no longer exist, such impairment losses are reversed and recognized in income. Such reversal shall not cause the carrying amount to exceed the amount that would have resulted had no impairment taken place during the preceding periods.\n\nSubsequent costs arising, for example, from additional or replacement capital expenditure are only recognized as part of the acquisition or production cost of the asset, or else -if relevant -recognized as a separate asset if it is probable that the Group will r eceive a future economic benefit and the cost can be determined reliably.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs that do not constitute significant replacement capital expenditure are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Borrowing Costs\n\nBorrowing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset from the time of acquisition or from the beginning of construction or production until its entry into service are capitalized and subsequently",

In the case of a specific financing arrangement, the respective borrowing costs incurred for that particular arrangement during the period are used. For nonspecific financing arrangements, a financing rate uniform within the Group of 2. 5 9 percent was applied fo r 2022 (202 1 : 2.79 percent). Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nThe Group receives grants for assets and grants related to income.\n\nGovernment investment subsidies do not reduce the acquisition and production costs of the respective assets; they are instead reported on the balance sheet as deferred income. They are recognized in income on a straight -line basis over the associated asset's expected useful life.\n\nGrants related to income are also generally recognized as deferre d income on the balance sheet. The liability item is reversed over the period necessary to match the corresponding income effects that are intended to compensate for the government grants. Grants are recognized in the same way as subsidized items.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized at fair value if the Group satisfies the necessary conditions for receipt of the grant and if it is highly probable that the grant will be issued.\n\n## Leasing\n\nLease agreements are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16, 'Leases' ('IFRS 16'). A lease is an agreement that conveys the right to use an identified asset for a specified period in exchange for consideration. In certain cases, agreements that are not concluded in the form of a rental or lease agreement (e.g., physical power purchase agreements) are also reviewed to determine whether they contain a lease in accordance with IFRS 16. E.ON is party to some agreements in which it is the lessor and to others in which it is the lessee.\n\n## E.ON as Lessee\n\nTransactions in which E.ON acts as a lessee are accounted for on the basis of the right -of -use model. The recognition exemption of IFRS 16.5 is used for low -value leases and for agreements with a lease term of less than 12 months (short -term leases). Accordingly, there is no recognition of the right -of -use asset and the lease liability. Instead, the payments are recognized on a straight -line basis as an expense. In line with internal management practice, intragroup leases are recognized as current expenses in the segment reporting.\n\nA lease liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the existing payment obligation. Where an arrangement provides for payments for lease components and non -lease components, the payments are not separated using the practical expedient under IFRS 16.15 (with the exception of real estate leases); the lease liability is measured taking into account the total amount of the payments. Present value is determined by discounting with an incremental borrowing rate that is equivalent in terms of risk and term if the implicit interest rate cannot be determined. The liability is subsequently measured using the effective interest method. A right -of -use asset corresponding with the lease liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the lease payments. The initial recognition amount of the right -of -use asset is increased by the amount of the initial direct costs, as well as expected costs for asset retirement obligations; prepayments made are included and lease incentives received are deducted from the initial recognition amount. A right -of -use asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost. Depreciation is carried out on a straight -line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the identified asset. An impairment test is carried out in accordance with IAS 36 if events or changed circumstances indicate an impairment.\n\nE.ON ensures its operational flexibility when concluding leasing agreements through the use of extension and termination options. In determining the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise\n\nexisting options. The lease term therefore also includes periods covered by extension options if it is assumed with reasonable certainty that they will be exercised.\n\n## E.ON as Lessor\n\nLease transactions in which E.ON acts as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases depending on the distribution of risks and rewards. If a lease is classified as an operating lease, E.ON recognizes the identified asset and recognizes the lease payments as other operating income on a straight -line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the identified asset is derecognized and a receivable is recognized in the amount of the net investment value. Payments made by the lessee are treated as a reduction of the lease receivable or interest income. The income from such arrangements is recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method. Subleases are classified based on the right -of -use asset under the head lease.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Non-D erivative Financial Instruments\n\nNonderivative financial instruments are measured in accordance with IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' ('IFRS 9'). They are recognized at fair value, including transaction costs, on the settlement date when acquired, provided they are not recognized at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost (AmC), financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) based on the business model and the characteristics of the cash flows.\n\nIf a financial asset is held for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and the cash flows of the financial asset represent exclusively interest and principal payments, then the financial asset is measured at amortized cost (AmC).",

Realized gains and losses are determined by analyzing each transaction individually .\n\nDebt instruments that do not exclusively serve to collect contractual cash flows or to both generate contractual cash flows and sales revenue, or whose cash flows do not exclusively consist of interest and principal payments are measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). For equity instruments that are not held for trading purposes, E.ON exercises the fair value option (FVPL).\n\nImpairments of financial assets are both recognized for losses already incurred and for expected future credit defaults. The amount of the impairment loss calculated in the determination of expected credit losses is recognized on the income statement.\n\nThe expected future credit loss is calculated by multiplying the probability of default by the carrying amount of the financial asset (exposure at default) and the expected loss ratio (loss given default). For information on the treatment of impairments under IFRS 9, please see Note 3 2.\n\nNonderivative financial liabilities (including trade payables) within the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Initial measurement takes place at fair value, with transaction costs included in the measurement. In the subsequent measurement, the residual carrying amount is adjusted by the amortization and accretion of any premium or\n\nd iscount remaining until maturity. The premium or discount is recognized in financial results over its term .\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments and separated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value as of th e trading date at initial recognition. Under IFRS 9, they are classified as at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) as long as they are not a component of a hedge accounting relationship. Gains and losses from changes in fair value are immediately recognized in net income.\n\nThe instruments primarily used are foreign currency forwards and cross -currency interest rate swaps, as well as interest rate swaps. In commodities, the instruments used primarily include physically and financially settled forwards and options related to electricity and gas.\n\nAs part of fair value measurement in accordance with IFRS 13, the counterparty risk is also taken into account for derivative financial instruments. E.ON determines this risk based on a portfolio valuati on in a bilateral approach for both own credit risk (debt value adjustment) and the credit risk of the corresponding counterparty (credit value adjustment). The counterparty risks thus determined are allocated to the individual financial instruments by applying the relative fair value method on a net basis.\n\nE.ON has designated some of these derivatives as part of a hedging relationship. IFRS 9 sets requirements for the admissibility of hedging instruments and the underlyings, the formal designation and docu mentation of hedging relationships, the hedging strategy, as well as fulfilling requirements of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting. The designated hedged items and hedging instruments are subject to the same risk. This economic relationship ensures that the amounts of the hedged items and hedging instruments are offset against each other and that the hedging relationships are therefore effective. The hedge ratio of the hedges is 1:1. Ineffectiveness\n\narises only if the measurement parameters of the hedged item and the hedging instrument differ from one another or in the case of subsequent designation of the hedging instrument. All components of derivative gains and losses from the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness are taken into conside ration during recognition.\n\nFor qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item that is due to the hedged risk(s) are recognized in income.\n\nIf a derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge under IFRS 9, the effective portion of the hedging instrument's change in fair value is recognized in equity (as a component of other comprehensive income) and reclassified into income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the transaction being hedged affect income. In accordance with IFRS 9, the currency basis spread (hedging costs) will be separated from the hedging instrument and reported separately as an excluded component in accumulated other comprehensive income in the reserve for hedging costs as a component of equity.\n\nThe hedging result is reclassified into income during the period in which the cash flows of the hedged asset are recognized in income. The result is recognized immediately in income if it becomes probable that the hedged underlying transaction will no longer occur. For hedging instruments used to establish cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement to the extent required.\n\nTo hedge the foreign currency risk arising from the Company's net investment in foreign operations, derivative as well as non -derivative financial instruments are used. Gains or losses due to changes in fair value and from foreign currency translation are recognized within equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, under currency translation adjustments.",

Gains and losses from interest -rate derivatives are included in interest income.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses resulting from the initial measurement of derivative financial instruments at the inception of the contract are not recognized in income. They are instead deferred and recognized in income systematically over the term of the derivative. An exception to the accrual principle applies if unrealized gains a nd losses from the initial measurement are verified by quoted market prices, observable prices of other current market transactions or other observable data supporting the valuation technique. In this case the gains and losses are recognized in income.\n\nContracts (in particular sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas) that are entered into for purposes of receiving or delivering nonfinancial items in accordance with E.ON's anticipated procurement, sale or use requirements, and held as such, are generally classified as own -use contracts.\n\nThey are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) in accordance with IFRS 9, but as pending transactions subject to the rules of IAS 37. Contracts that provide for net settlement and resales of the quantities to be delivered at a future date generally cannot, as a rule, be classified as own -use contracts. Based on forward -looking forecasts of delivery quantities specified by customer structure and por tfolio management, contracts with physical settlement upon conclusion are recognized as derivatives for which settlement cannot be ensured within the scope of ordinary delivery. This 'safety buffer' is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted if necessary.\n\nEmbedded derivatives in own -use contracts must be separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 if the economic characteristics and risks of these derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contr act. The contract is assessed upon conclusion to determine whether a derivative is required to be separated. A reassessment must be carried out if there is a significant change in the terms of the contract or in the context of business combinations.\n\nAgreements to buy or sell non -financial items that are not classified as own -use contracts under IFRS 9 and that are required to be accounted for as derivatives (so -called 'failed -own -use' contracts) must be realized or recognized in the balance sheet at the market price applicable at the time of physical settlement. In addition, any income from commodity derivatives arising from the difference between the contract price and the market price is recognized in other operating income.\n\nIFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' ('IFRS 7'), and IFRS 13 both require comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the extent of risks arising from financial instruments. Additional information on financial instruments is provided in Notes 31 and 32.\n\nNonderivative and derivative financial instruments are netted on the balance sheet if under IAS 32 E.ON has both an unconditional right -even in the event of the counterparty's insolvency -and the intention to settle offsetting positions simultaneously and/or on a net basis.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost and net realizable value. The cost of raw materials, finished products and goods purchased for resale is determined based on the average cost method. In addition to production materials and wages, production costs include material and production overheads based on normal capacity. The costs of general administration are not capitalized. Inventory risks resulting from\n\nexcess and obsolescence are provided for using appropriate valuation allowances, whereby inventories are written down to net realizable value.\n\n## Emission Rights and Similar Certificates\n\nEmission rights and similar certificates held under national and international emissions trading systems for the settlement of obligations are capitalized at cost at the date of acquisition and reported under current assets. Subsequent measurement is at amortized cost under IAS 38.\n\nThe obligation to submit emission rights and similar certificates to the relevant authorities is recognized as a liability as of the balance sheet date. Measurement is based on the best estimate of the future settlement amount.\n\n## Receivables, Contract Assets or Liabilities and Other Assets\n\nA receivable is recognized under IFRS 15 when the goods or services are delivered, provided that the right to consideration is unconditional, i.e., is only related to the passage of time. However, if the right to receive the consideration is contingent upon conditions other than the passage of time, a contract asset is recognized. A contract liability under IFRS 15 is recognized when consideration has been received for an existing IFRS 15 contract and the right to receive the goods or services still exists in full or in part. The contractual liability is only reversed with an effect on revenue when E.ON has performed the corresponding service. An asset is recognized under other assets under IFRS 15 if the cost of obtaining the contract is expected to be recovered and the amortization period is longer than one year. Other assets are amortized over the estimated term of the contract depending on how the goods or services to which the costs relate are transferred to the customer. If the estimated term of the contract is less than one year, the costs are immediately recognized as an expense on the income statement. Receivables and other assets are initially measured at fair value, which generally approximates nominal",

They are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Trade receivables without a significant financial component are measured upon initial recognition at their transaction price. Valuation allowances, included in the reported net carrying amount, are provided for identifiable individual risks. If the loss of a certain part of the receivables is probable, valuation allowances are provided to cover the expected loss. Impairments are also recognized for expected future credit losses.\n\n## Liquid Funds\n\nLiquid funds include checks, cash on hand, bank balances and current securities.\n\nLiquid funds with an original maturity of more than three months are recognized under securities and fixed -term deposits provided that their maturities are not more than 12 months and therefore are recognized under non -current financial receivables and other financial assets .\n\nLiquid funds with an original maturity of less than three months are considered to be cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. This also applies if they are merely contractually restricted, in which case the funds can technically be disposed of at any time at E.ON's discretion. However, if, as a result of a restriction, liquid funds cannot technically be disposed of at any time at E.ON's discretion, they are reported separately as restricted liquid funds .\n\n## Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\n\nNoncurrent assets and any corresponding liabilities held for sale and any directly attributable liabilities are recognized separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in the line items 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities associated with assets held for sale' if they can be disposed of in their current condition and if there is sufficient probability of their disposal actually taking place. The reclassification to the separate balance sheet items is\n\nshown in the fixed asset movement schedule under Changes in scope of consolidation.\n\nDiscontinued operations are components of an entity that are either held for sale or have already been sold and can be clearly distinguished from other corporate operations, both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. Additionally, the component of the entity classified as a discontinued operation must represent a major business l ine or a specific geographic business segment of the Group or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.\n\nNoncurrent assets that are held for sale either individually or collectively as part of a disposal group, or that belong to a discontinued operatio n, are no longer depreciated. They are instead accounted for at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less any remaining costs to sell. If this value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses.\n\nThe income and losses resulting from the measurement of components held for sale as well as the gains and losses arising from the disposal of discontinued operations, are reported separately on the face of the income statement under income/loss from discontinued operations, net, as is the income from the ordinary operating activities of these divisions. Prior -year income statement figures are adjusted accordingly. The relevant assets and liabilities are reported in a separate line on the balance sheet. The cash flows of discontinued operations are reported separately in the cash flow statement, with prior -year figures adjusted accordingly. However, there is no reclassification of prior -year balance sheet line items attributable to discontinued operations .\n\n## Equity Instruments\n\nE.ON has entered into purchase commitments to holders of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. By means of these agreements, the non -controlling shareholders have the right to require E.ON to purchase their shares on specified conditions. None of the contractual obligations has led to the transfer of\n\nsubstantially all of the risk and rewards to E.ON at the time of entering into the contract. Under the anticipated acquisition method, however, the right of tender is accounted for as if it had already been exercised. Accordingly, the minority interests are derecognized -irrespective of the probability of the option being exercised -and at the same time a liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the repurchase amount i n accordance with IAS 32, 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' (IAS 32). The difference between this measurement and the carrying amount of the minority shareholders' equity to be derecognized is recognized in equity of E.ON SE shareholders. The accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense. If a purchase commitment expires unexercised, the liability reverts to non -controlling interests. Any remaining difference is then recognized directly in equity in retained earnings.\n\nWhere shareholders of entities own statutory, non -excludable rights of termination (as in the case of German partnerships, for example), such termination rights require the reclassification of non-controlling interests from equity into liabilities under IAS 32. The liability is recognized at the present value of the expected settlement amount irrespective of the probability of termination. Changes in the value of the liability are reported within other operating income. Accretion of the share of the results of the no ncontrolling shareholders' share in net income is recognized in Net interest income/expense.\n\nIf E.ON SE or a Group company buys treasury shares of E.ON SE, the value of the consideration paid, including directly attributable additional costs (net after income taxes), is deducted from E.ON SE's equity until the shares are retired, distributed or resold. If such treasury shares are subsequently distributed or sold, the consideration received, net of any directly attributable additional transaction costs and associated income taxes, is recognized in equity in additional paid-in capital.",

'\n\nIn fiscal years 2018 to 2022 , virtual shares were granted to members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain E.ON Group executives under the new E.ON Performance Plan. See the Compensation Report for more details on the structure of the plan.\n\nThe E.ON Performance Plan represents commitments of the Company which provide for cash compensation based on the share price performance at the end of the term. The compensation expense is measured taking into account the fair value of the virtual shares granted and recognized in personnel expense pro rata over the vesting period .\n\nIn 2022 , as in 2021, employees of E.ON SE and participating subsidiaries once again had the opportunity to purchase E.ON shares at favorable conditions under the employee stock purchase progra m. The program includes a share -based payment settled in equity instruments (shares of E.ON SE) as consideration for services rendered or work performed. The corresponding compensation under IFRS 2 was recognized in personnel expense and the offsetting entry was made in equity.\n\n## Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations\n\nMeasurement of defined benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits,' is based on actuarial computations using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations performed at yea rend. The valuation encompasses both pension obligations and pension entitlements that are known on the reporting date and economic trend assumptions such as assumptions on wage and salary growth rates and pension increase rates, among others, that are made in order to reflect realistic expectations, as well as variables specific to reporting dates such as discount rates, for example.\n\nIncluded in gains and losses from the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset are actuarial gains and losses that may arise especially from differences between estimated and actual variations in underlying assumptions about demographic and financial variables. Additionally included is the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected interest income on plan assets included in the net interest result. Remeasurement effects are recognized in full in the period in which they occur and are not reported within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but are instead recognized within the S tatements of Recognized Income and Expenses as part of equity.\n\nThe employer service cost representing the additional benefits that employees earned under the benefit plan during the fiscal year is reported under personnel costs; the net interest on the net liability or asset from defined benefit pension plans determined based on the discount rate applicable at the start of the fiscal year is reported under financial results.\n\nPast service cost, as well as gains and losses from settlements, are fully recognized in the income statement in the period in which the underlying plan amendment, curtailment or settlement takes place. They are reported under personnel costs.\n\nThe amount reported on the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets. If a net asset position arises from this calculation, the amount is limited to the present value of available refunds and the reduction in future contributions and to the benefit from prepayments of minimum funding requirements. Such an asset position is recognized as an operating receivable.\n\nPayments for defined contribution pension plans are expensed as incurred and reported under personnel costs. Contributions to state pension plans are treated like payments for defined contribution pension plans to the extent that the obligations under these pension plans generally correspond to those under defined contribution pension plans.\n\n## Provisions for Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Miscellaneous Provisions\n\nIn accordance with IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' ('IAS 37'), provisions are recognized when E.ON has a legal or constructive present obligation towards third parties as a result of a past event, it is probable that E.ON will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is recognized at the expected settlement amount. Long -term obligations are reported as liabilities at the present value of their expected settlement amounts if the interest rate effect (the difference between present value and repayment amount) resulting from discounting is material; future cost increases that are foreseeable and likely to occur on the balance sheet date at year -end must also be included in the measurement. Longterm obligations are generally discounted at the market interest rate applicable as of the respective balance sheet date, provided that it is not negative. The accretion amounts and the effects of changes in interest rates are generally presented as part of financial results. A reimbursement related to the provision that is virtually certain to be collected is capitalized as a separate asset. No offsetting within provisions is permitted. Advance payments remitted are deducted from the provisions.\n\nObligations arising from the decommissioning or dismantling of property, plant and equipment are recognized during the period of their occurrence at their discounted settlement amounts, provided that the obligation can be reliably estimated, whereby no negative discount rates are applied. The carrying amounts of the respective property, plant and equipment are increased by the same amounts. In subsequent periods, capitalized asset retirement costs are amortized over the expected remaining useful lives of the assets, and the provision is accreted to its present value on an annual basis. Advance payments remitted are deducted from the provisions.\n\nChanges in estimates arise in particular from deviations from original co st estimates, from changes to the maturity or the scope",

The adjustment of provisions for the decommissioning and restoration of property, plant and equipment for changes to estimates is generally recognized by way of a corresponding adjustment to these assets, with no effect on income. As the property, plant and equipment concerned have, however, frequently already been fully depreciated, changes to estimates are primarily recognized within the income statement.\n\nThe estimates for nuclear decommissioning provisions are derived from studies, cost estimates, legally binding civil agreements and legal information. A material element in the estimates are the real interest rates applied (the applied discount rate, less the cost increase rate). No provisions are established for contingent asset retirement obligations where the type, scope, timing and associated probabilities cannot be det ermined reliably.\n\nIf onerous contracts exist in which the unavoidable costs of meeting a contractual obligation exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract, provisions are established for losses from pending transactions. Such provisions are recognized at the lower of the excess obligation upon performance under the contract and any potential penalties or compensation arising in the event of nonperformance. Obligations under an open contractual relationship a re determined from a sales market perspective.\n\nProvisions for pending sales transactions must also be recognized if these transactions are subject to the own -use -exemption under IFRS 9 and if they are partially offset by offsetting transactions that are ac counted for as derivative financial instruments and are therefore measured at current market prices. As a result, provisions are recognized under IAS 37 for transactions actually subject to the own -use exemption, for the purpose of which the market values of the procurement portfolio are taken into consideration in the calculation of the imputed performance costs.\n\nThe book structure adopted under IFRS 9 therefore affects the accounting treatment of the corresponding provisions.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations toward third parties arising from past events that are not wholly within the control of the entity, or else present obligations toward third parties arising from past events in which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet.\n\nA more detailed description is not provided for certain contingent liabilities and contingent receivables, particularly in connection with pending litigation, as this information could influence further proceedings.\n\nWhere necessary, provisions for restructuring costs are recognized at the present value of the future outflows of resources. Provisions are recognized once a detailed restructuring plan has been decided on by management and publicly announced or communicated to the employees or their representatives. Only those expenses that are directly attributable to the restructuring measures are used in measuring the amount of the provision. Expenses associated with the future operation are not taken into consideration.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nUnder IAS 12, 'Income Taxes' ('IAS 12'), deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and their tax bases (balance sheet liability method). Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable or deductible amounts when taxable income is calculated for future periods, unless those differences are the result of the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss (initial differences). Uncertain tax positions are recognized at their most likely value.\n\nIAS 12 further requires that deferred tax assets be recognized for unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized. Each of the corporate entities is assessed individually with regard to the probability of a positive tax result in future years. The planning horizon is basically three to five years in this context. Any existing history of losses is incorporated in this assessment. For those tax assets to which these assumptions do not apply, the value of the deferred tax assets is reduced.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities caused by temporary differences associated with investments in affiliated and associated companies are recognized unless the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences can be controlled within the Group and it is probable that, owing to this control, the differences will in fact not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to be applicable for taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates and tax law is generally recognized in net income. Equity is adjusted for deferred taxes that had previously been recognized directly in equity. The change is generally recognized in the period in which the material legislative process is completed. To the extent that they are material, income taxes for transaction costs of an equity transaction are recognized directly in equity under IAS 12.\n\nIncome tax items are regularly assessed, in particular against the backdrop of numerous changes in tax laws, tax regulations, legal decisions and ongoing tax audits. E.ON is responding to this circumstance, in particular through the application of IFRIC 23, by continuously identifying and assessing the tax environment and the resulting effects. The most current information is then incorporated into the estimate parameters necessary for",

Accordingly, related potential interest rate effects are also assessed, measured and reported separately.\n\n## Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows,' the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are classified in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nIn accordance with the so -called management approach required by IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments,' the internal reporting organization used by management for making decisions on operating matters is used to identify the Company's reportable segments. The internal performance measure used as the segment result since this year is EBITDA (EBIT in the prior year) adjusted to exclude certain non -opera ting effects (see Note 35). Transactions between the reportable segments are recorded at arm's length transfer prices.\n\n## Structure of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statement of Income\n\nIn accordance with IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements,' th e Consolidated Balance Sheets have been prepared using a classified balance sheet structure. Assets that will be realized within 12 months of the reporting date, as well as liabilities that are due to be settled within one year of the reporting date are ge nerally classified as current.\n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using the nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal purposes.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions; Critical Judgments in the Application of Accounting Policies\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may both influence the application of accounting principles within the Group and affect the measurement and presentation of reported figures. Estimates are based on past experience and on current knowledge obtained on the transactions to be reported. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as necessary in the periods in which they were recognized.\n\nEstimates are particularly necessary for the measurement of the value of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets, specifically in connection with purchase price allocations, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets, the accounting treatment of provisions for pensions and other provisions (in particular provisions for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and provisions for contingent losses from pending tr ansactions involving the sale of electricity and gas), for impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36, as well as the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments, as well as for the application of IFRS 15, and here in particular for the estimation of the value of electricity and gas units supplied, including the estimated values for units between the last settlement and the end of the period. Estimates are also factored in when applying IFRS 16, namely in connection with the determination of lease terms and the calculation of the discount rate, and in part when applying IFRS 9 in connection with the determination of expected future credit losses .\n\nThe application of accounting policies requires judgments to be made that may affect the amounts recognized in the financial statements. Judgments are relevant, for example, when assessing whether an item is to be classified in accordance with IFRS 5. Here, management assesses whether a disposal is considered highly probable. Furthe r judgments may be necessary in assessing whether E.ON controls, jointly controls with other investors, or can significantly influence an entity.\n\nSpecifically, management assesses here what the significant activities of the C ompany are, i.e., which activities have a material impact on the returns of the investee. The list of shareholdings (see Note 38) provides information on the form of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of certain investees whose share of voting rights indicates a different form of inclusion.\n\nThe underlying principles used for estimates in additional relevant topics are outlined in the respective sections.\n\nIn addition, estimates and judgments continue to be subject to increased uncertainty, in particular due to the significant volume and price volatilities on the energy markets due to the war in Ukraine and the consequences of the Covid -19 pandemic. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates and judgments made; changes may have a material impact on E.ON's net assets, financial position and results of operations. When the estimates and judgments were updated, all available information on expected economic developments and country -specific government measures was taken into account on the reporting date. I t is difficult to predict the duration and the extent of the impact on assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Russia -Ukraine war and the Covid -19 pandemic . More information on the impact of the Russia -Ukraine war in the E.ON Group is presented in Note 3.",

This invasion is having far -reaching economic consequences, and direct impacts -particularly in the energy sector -are being experienced, which are also explained further in the 'Industry Environment' section of the Management Report.\n\nThe consequences of the war also have an impact on E.ON's business, primarily due to increased tension and high volatility on the commodity markets. Commodity prices rose relentlessly throughout 2022 into the third quarter; by the end of the year, prices had declined significantly, but remained at a very high level. This had a corresponding impact on the sales and procurement transactions recognized on the balance sheet. Market values recognized on the balance sheet at the end of the year declined as a result of the realization of some of the procurement contracts concluded before the start of the war and from the corresponding new contracts concluded at high prices. This was partially offset by the development of provisions for onerous contracts in connection with pending electricity and gas supply contracts with customers . The impacts are explained in more detail in the sections 'Earnings Situation,' 'Financial Situation' and 'Asset Situation' of the Management Report.\n\nOne of them is a possible valuation risk for financial assets, including the investment in Nord Stream AG held in pension plan assets. Amid heightened uncertainty and against the backdrop of damage to both Nord Stream 1 pipelines, this investment was written down to its fair value of zero as of December 31, 2022. This decline of about \u20ac1.2 billion relative to December 31, 2021, was recognized in equity in other comprehensive income in acco rdance with IAS 19.\n\nThe situation assessable at the balance -sheet date with regard to the Russia -Ukraine war indicated no triggering events that would necessitate impairment charges on non -current assets under IAS 36, in particular goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, high energy prices due to the Russia -Ukraine war affected the ability of customers to pay significantly increased energy bills and led to additional impairment losses on trade receivables.\n\nPotential balance sheet effects of the future development of the war in Ukraine are being analyzed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Europe -wide energy crisis has prompted the governments of some countries in which E.ON operates to adopt various measures to soften the impact on the end consumer . Some of these measures may directly impact E.ON, such as the introduction of price caps or the elimination of excess earnings. In particular, the price caps could have a direct impact on E.ON's revenues under IFRS 15. However, these charges will not have a material effect on E.ON's earnings in the 2022 financial year. For example, negative effects from price caps were mostly offset by government grants in accordance with IAS 20 (see the comments in Notes 6 and 9). There are also government measures that do not directly affect E.ON, such as the temporary assumption of energy costs for the end consumer .\n\n## (4) Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe number of consolidated companies changed as follows in 2022 :\n\n| Scope of Consolidation                          |          |         |       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|-------|\n|                                                 | Domestic | Foreign | Total |\n| Consolidated companies  as of January 1, 2021   | 171      | 191     | 362   |\n| Additions                                       | 4        | 4       | 8     |\n| Disposals/Mergers                               | 9        | 39      | 48    |\n| Consolidated companies  as of December 31, 2021 | 166      | 156     | 322   |\n| Additions                                       | 4        | 3       | 7     |\n| Disposals/Mergers                               | 4        | 16      | 20    |\n| Consolidated companies  as of December 31, 2022 | 166      | 143     | 309   |\n\nIn 2022 , a total of 5 4 domestic and 1 0 foreign associated companies were consolidated under the equity method (202 1 : 5 2 domestic companies and 1 1 foreign companies). One domestic company reported as joint operations was presented pro rata on the consolidated financial statements (202 1 : one domestic company).\n\n## (5) Material Acquisitions, Disposals and Disposal Groups in 2022\n\n## Consortium Agreement with RheinEnergie\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Westenergie AG, a fully consolidated subsidiary of the E.ON Group, entered into a new consortium agreement with RheinEnergie AG. This agreement will enable E.ON to exert additional significant influence on the further development of the energy supply in one of Germany's fastest -growing economic regions and to benefit from growth and synergies in the Rhineland. According to current plans, Westenergie and RheinEnergie will merge shareholdings in individual municipal utilities into rhenag Rheinische Energie",

During this process, regional shareholdings of both parties will be contributed to rhenag. rhenag continues to be fully consolidated by Westenerg ie. Independently of this, Westenergie and RheinEnergie will further optimize their operational cooperation with regard to plant management, leases and service agreements. The Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Cartel Office) has granted approval in principle for the measures provided for in the Consortium Agreement. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023 once the conditions imposed by the Bundeskartellamt have been met. Within the framework of the entire transaction, Westenergie will transfer an additional 20 percent of the shares of Stadtwerke Duisburg, which is included in the consolidated financial statements as an associated company, to RheinEnergie, which will increase its share in RheinEnergie from 20 to 24.9 percent. The shareh olding in Stadtwerke Duisburg is allocated to the Energy Networks Germany segment and since Q2 2021 the investment has been reported for the first time as an asset held for sale under IFRS 5 in the amount of \u20ac154 million. No impairment loss was recognized from the comparison of the carrying amount with its fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Pro Rata Disposal of Stromnetz -gesellschaft Essen GmbH & Co. KG\n\nWestnetz GmbH sold 50 percent of the limited partnership interests in the newly established Stromnetzgesellschaft Essen GmbH & Co. KG to Essener Versorgungs - und Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH (EVV), with effect from January 1, 2022. Technical equipment such as the low -voltage grid of the city of Essen was transferred to this company, also with effect from January 1, 2022. Since the closing of the transaction, these assets have been leased back from E.ON, so that E.ON continues to operate the network. In Q3 2021, the criteria of IFRS 5 for reporting the assets to be contributed as held for sale were met for the first time. As a result, the corresponding property, plant and equipment in the amount of \u20ac136 million included in the Energy\n\nNetworks Germany segment has since been reported separately under 'Assets held for sale' in the balance sheet. No impairment loss was recognized from the comparison of the carrying amount with its fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Pro Rata Disposal of Westconnect GmbH\n\nWestenergie AG sold 50 percent of its shareholding in Westconnect GmbH (formerly known as Westenergie Breitband GmbH) to Igneo Infrastructure Partners with effect from October 31, 2022. Westconnect GmbH was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of the E.ON Group. The conditions for the consolidation of Westconnect GmbH as a joint venture in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements were met with effect from November 1, 2022.\n\nIn cooperation with the new partner, the high -speed broadband infrastructure in Germany will be expanded. Under the plan, more than 1.5 million households and large customers in Germany will be supplied with fiber -optic broadband lines in the future.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, the criteria of IFRS 5 for reporting the disposal group as held for sale were met for the first time. As a result, the assets and liabilities of Westconnect GmbH, which is allocated to the Energy Networks Germany segment, have since been reported in the balance sheet as 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities associated with assets held for sale,' respectively.\n\nWestconnect GmbH was deconsolidated upon completion of the transaction and, since November 1, 2022, has been accounted for in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements under the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 (see Note 16). The deconsolidation resulted in income of \u20ac810 million, of which \u20ac530 million is attributable to the fair value remeasurement of the remaining shares. In total, assets previously reported as held for sale, primarily other technical equipment, plant and machinery, and goodwill decreased by \u20ac766 million, and liabilities previously\n\nreported as held for sale, primarily liabilities from subsidies, decreased by \u20ac171 million.\n\n## Conclusion of a Future Consolidation Agreement by ZSE shareholders\n\nOn April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') and V\u00fdchodoslovensk\u00e1 energetika Holding a.s. ('VSEH'), E.ON SE and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Group. The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of the VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all or selected subsidiaries of VSEH to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate law changes at VSEH.\n\nThe transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE will result in ZSE becoming VSEH's sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of selected VSEH subsidiaries). The ownership interests in ZSE will remain unchanged; that is, E.ON will have a 49 percent stake in ZSE and the Slovakian state a 51 percent stake. The new ZSE shareholder agreement, which has yet to be concluded, is intended to essentially correspond to the shareholder agreement that is also currently in force. After closing of the agreement, ZSE will continue to be accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements, while the business activities of VSEH, which was previously fully consolidated, will also be presented using the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe transaction was originally expected to be closed by the end of 2022. Accordingly, the VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021. The transaction is currently expected to close no earlier than in the second quarter of 2023. Of the assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022, \u20ac945 million are non -current assets and \u20ac248 million are current assets. Goodwill of \u20ac149 million was also allocated. The corresponding liabilities (before minority interest deduction) amount to \u20ac764 million, of which \u20ac351 million",

An impairment of \u20ac61 million was recognized in 2022; this figure has already been included in the above figures.\n\n## Disposal of the Universal Service Provider Business in Hungary\n\nTo further optimize its portfolio in Hungary, on February 23, 2022, E.ON Hung\u00e1ria Zrt. signed an agreement with MVM Zrt. to sell 100 percent of its shares in E.ON \u00c1ramszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. ('E\u00c1S'). E\u00c1S holds a regional universal service provider license and supplies electricity to customers in certain regions in Hungary on this basis. As of December 31, 2021, the transaction was expected to be successfully concluded within the next 12 months. As a result, E\u00c1S or the universal service provider business, which was allocated to the Customer Solutions Other segment in the E.ON Group, was reported as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 as of December 31, 2021. The transaction was concluded on April 14, 2022, and the deconsolidation result amounted to -\u20ac11 million. In total, assets previously reported as held for sale, primarily receivables, decreased by \u20ac72 million and liabilities previously reported as held for sale, primarily operating liabilities and provisions, decreased by \u20ac59 million.\n\nDeconsolidation results are generally allocated to other operating income.\n\n## (6) Revenues\n\nAt \u20ac115.7 billion, revenues in 202 2 were roughly \u20ac 38.3 billion higher than in the previous year, primarily due to price developments on the commodity markets .\n\nThe higher prices for energy resulted on the one hand in higher selling prices on the sales markets. On the other hand, in the case of sales volumes purchased on a forward basis, which are to be\n\naccounted for as derivatives under IFRS 9, the corresponding revenues are to be measured at market prices at the time of physical delivery (so -called failed own -use adjustments).\n\nRevenues recognized in the current reporting period arising from performance obligations that have been fully or partially settled in prior reporting periods amounted to \u20ac 0.7 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0 .4 billion). The total amount of performance obligations already contracted but still outstanding (excluding expected contract renewals and expected new contracts) was \u20ac 43.6 billion as of December 31, 202 2 (December 31, 202 1 : \u20ac28.1 billion). The majority of these benefit obligations are expected to be met within the next three years. Revenue in the E.ON Group is recognized primarily on an over -time basis. Revenue recognized under non -IFRS 15 accounting standards totaled \u20ac5.1 b illion in fiscal 202 2 (2021: \u20ac6 73 m illion ) . Of this amount, \u20ac1.6 billion resulted from performance -related government grants.\n\nRevenues are broken down into intragroup and external revenues in the segment information (Note 35). They are also broken down into key regions and technologies. The overview also shows the effect of revenues on operating cash flow before interest and taxes.\n\n## (7) Own Work Capitalized\n\nOwn work capitalized amounted to \u20ac 997 million in 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac761 million) and resulted primarily from capitalized work performed in connection with ongoing and completed IT projects and network assets.\n\n## (8) Other Operating Income and Expenses\n\nThe table below provides details of other operating income for the periods indicated:\n\n## Other Operating Income\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from exchange rate differences                                      | 853    | 478    |\n| Gain on derivative financial instruments  (including currency derivatives) | 70,234 | 44,737 |\n| Gain on disposal of  non- current assets  and securities                   | 999    | 360    |\n| Gain on the reversal of provisions                                         | 16     | 155    |\n| Miscellaneous                                                              | 1,091  | 1,653  |\n| Total                                                                      | 73,193 | 47,383 |\n\nOther operating income increased by \u20ac25, 810 million to \u20ac73,193 million (2021: \u20ac47, 3 83 million).\n\nIncome and expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) relate to fair value measurement under IFRS 9.\n\nIncome from derivative financial instruments increased year -onyear by \u20ac25, 497 milli on to \u20ac 70,234 million (2021: \u20ac44.737 million), mainly due to price developments on the commodity markets during the course of the year.\n\nCommodity derivatives generated income in the amount of \u20ac6 8,302 million (2021: \u20ac 43,909 million). I n addition, income from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) includes realized income from currency derivatives of \u20ac1,632 million (2021: \u20ac339 million).

In 2021 there were gains on the disposal of Rampion Renewables in the amount of \u20ac64 million. Gains were realized on the sale of securities in the amount of \u20ac26 million (2021: \u20ac41 million).\n\nMiscellaneous other operating income decreased by \u20ac562 million compared with the prior year.\n\nIn 2021, this included effects of \u20ac560 million from the refund of previous purchases of residual electricity volumes.\n\nMiscellaneous also includes items such as transactions other than ordinary business activities in the amount of \u20ac21 2 million (2021: \u20ac221 million), income from contract penalties of \u20ac83 million (2021: \u20ac70 million), and rental and lease income of \u20ac58 million (2021: \u20ac58 million) and realizations of own -use contracts recognized as liabilities as part of the innogy purchase price allocation in the amount of \u20ac26 million (2021: \u20ac99 million).\n\nThe following table provides details of other operating expenses for the periods indicated:\n\n## Other Operating Expenses\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Loss from exchange rate differences                                         | 524    | 885    |\n| Loss on derivative financial instruments   (including currency derivatives) | 66,663 | 26,486 |\n| Taxes other than income taxes                                               | 111    | 42     |\n| Loss on disposal of non- current assets and securities                      | 223    | 209    |\n| Impairments of financial assets                                             | 660    | 319    |\n| Miscellaneous                                                               | 3,555  | 3,724  |\n| Total                                                                       | 71,736 | 31,665 |\n\nOther operating expenses of \u20ac71,736 million were \u20ac40,071 million higher than in the previous year (2021: \u20ac31,665 million). The increase is due to the \u20ac40,177 million rise in expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) to \u20ac66,663 million (2021: \u20ac26.486 million). Similar to the development in income from derivative financial instruments, this was mainly due to price developments on the commodity markets over the course of the year.\n\nExpenses from commodity derivatives amounted to \u20ac64,615 million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac 25,990 million) .\n\nIn addition, expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) includes realized expenses from currency derivatives of \u20ac1,473 million (2021: \u20ac51 million).\n\nExpenses from exchange rate differences in the amount of \u20ac524 million decreased by \u20ac361 million compared with the previous year (\u20ac885 million).\n\nForeign currency translation effects within other operating expenses amounted to \u20ac1,880 million (2021: \u20ac1,161 million).\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses includes effects from the recognition of own -use contracts capitalized in connection with innogy's purchase -price allocation amounting to \u20ac32 million (2021: \u20ac163 million).

This increase was mainly due to higher energy prices on the commodity markets. These factors have generated higher direct procurement costs and also have led to recognition of the corresponding expenses at the current market price at the time of realization in the case of forward procurement contracts that are to be accounted for as derivative financial instruments in accordance with IFRS (so -called failed own -use contracts). Accordingly, income from the market valuation of commodity derivatives are recognized in other operating income.\n\nIn addition, the change in provisions for pending transactions was included in the materials expense. These provisions were primarily recognized for contracted sales transactions that are not subject to IFRS 9 (so -called own -use contracts), but which are economically part of a portfolio that is partly offset by procurement transactions to be acc ounted for as derivative financial instruments.\n\nGovernment subsidies received reduced the cost of materials by \u20ac774 million.\n\n## (10) Financial Results\n\nThe following table provides details of financial results for the periods indicated:\n\n## Financial Results\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                                                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income/loss from companies in which  equity investments are held                                                      | 20     | 186    |\n| Fair value through P&L                                                                                                | -16    | 133    |\n| Other                                                                                                                 | 36     | 53     |\n| Impairment charges/reversals  on                                                               other financial assets | -27    | -19    |\n| Income/loss from equity investments                                                                                   | -7     | 167    |\n| Income/loss from securities, interest                                                         and similar income      | 2,552  | 1,037  |\n| Amortized cost                                                                                                        | 77     | 42     |\n| Fair value through P&L                                                                                                | 457    | 772    |\n| Fair value through OCI                                                                                                | 15     | 14     |\n| Other interest income                                                                                                 | 2,003  | 209    |\n| Interest and similar expenses                                                                                         | -1,625 | -1,590 |\n| Amortized cost                                                                                                        | -762   | -743   |\n| Fair value through P&L                                                                                                | -576   | -546   |\n| Other interest expenses                                                                                               | -287   | -301   |\n| Net interest income/loss                                                                                              | 927    | -553   |\n| Financial results                                                                                                     | 920    | -386   |\n\nThe significant improvement in financial results relative to the previous year is primarily attributable to the effects in interest income, while income from equity investments decreased. The strong positive development of provisions attributable to the increase in discount rates is only partially influenced by the negative valuation effects of securities recognized at fair va lue.\n\nThe amortized cost reported in interest and similar expenses included the positive effect from the difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective interest rate of former innogy bonds, which was adjusted due to the purchase price alloca tion, in the amount of \u20ac204 million, which is \u20ac63 million\n\nlower than in the previous year. This item was partially offset by the reduction in interest expense from redeemed bonds.\n\nBoth income (\u20ac35 million; 2021: \u20ac284 million) and expenses ( -\u20ac236 million; 2021: -\u20ac131 million) from fair value through P&L include the valuation effects of securities recognized at fair value.\n\nOther interest income consists of interest income from discounting provisions for asset retirement obligations in the amount of \u20ac1,338 million (2021: \u20ac0 million), provisions for environmental remediation obligations of \u20ac253 million (2021: \u20ac7 million) and other non -current provisions in the amount of \u20ac302 million (2021: \u20ac22 million).\n\nOther interest expenses primarily relate to financial lease liabilities in the amount of \u20ac162 million (2021: \u20ac160 million) and net interest charges relating to pension provisions in the amount of \u20ac51 million (2021: \u20ac63 million).\n\nInterest expenses also include \u20ac80 million of negative earnings effects (2021: \u20ac38 million) from non -controlling interests in subsidiaries that have already been fully consolidated and interests in fully consolidated partnerships, which are to be recognized as liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, and with legal structures that give their shareholders a statutory right of withdrawal combined with an entitlement to a settlement payment. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest on debt totaling \u20ac8 million (2021: \u20ac7 million).",

The income tax rate of 31 percent corresponds to the tax rate applicable to E.ON SE for 2022. The differences from the effective tax rate are reconciled as follows:\n\nContinuing operations generated tax income of \u20ac245 million in the reporting year (2021: tax expense of \u20ac818 million). This corresponds to a theoretical tax rate of -12 percent. This was primarily due to a one -off effect from the measurement of deferred tax assets in connection with the development of net pension obligations.\n\nThe tax rate on operating earnings was 25 percent (prior year: 23 percent). The use of tax loss carryforwards, which had a positive effect on the tax rate, served to reduce the tax rate on operating earnings in the prior year.\n\n## Reconciliation to Effective Income Taxes/Tax Rate\n\n|                                                                            | 2022          | 2022   | 2021          | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|---------------|--------|\n|                                                                            | \u20ac in millions | in %   | \u20ac in millions | in %   |\n| Income/loss from continuing operations before taxes                        | 1,997         | 100.0  | 6,123         | 100.0  |\n| Expected income taxes                                                      | 619           | 31.0   | 1,898         | 31.0   |\n| Foreign tax rate differentials                                             | 162           | 8.1    | -149          | -2.4   |\n| Changes in tax rate/tax law                                                | -95           | -4.8   | 48            | 0.8    |\n| Tax effects on tax - free income                                           | -173          | -8.6   | -408          | -6.7   |\n| Tax effects of non - deductible expenses and permanent differences         | 475           | 23.8   | 399           | 6.5    |\n| Tax effects on income from companies accounted for under the equity method | -61           | -3.1   | -21           | -0.3   |\n| Tax effects of changes in value and non - recognition of deferred taxes    | - 1,264       | -63.3  | -767          | -12.5  |\n| Tax effects of other taxes on income                                       | 46            | 2.3    | 83            | 1.4    |\n| Tax effects of income taxes related to other periods                       | 59            | 2.9    | -246          | -4.0   |\n| Other                                                                      | -13           | -0.6   | -19           | -0.3   |\n| Effective income taxes/tax rate                                            | -245          | -12.3  | 818           | 13.4   |",

The change in previously unrecognized tax losses and temporary differences reduced deferred tax expense by \u20ac71 million (2021: \u20ac446 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, E.ON recognized deferred tax assets for companies (primarily in the UK) that incurred losses in the current or the prior -year period which exceed the deferred tax liabilities by \u20ac478 million (prior year: \u20ac497 million). The basis for recognizing deferred tax assets is an assessment by management based on the development of temporary reversal effects and concrete tax structuring measures of the extent to which it is probable that the respective companies will achieve taxable earnings in the future against which the as yet unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be offset.\n\nIncome taxes recognized in other comprehensive income break down as follows:\n\n## Income Taxes of Other Comprehensive Income\n\n| \u20ac in millions             |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred taxes within OCI |    124 |    726 |\n| Current taxes within OCI  |    -13 |    -13 |\n| Total                     |    111 |    713 |",

Changes in deferred tax liabilities, with n et disposals of -\u20ac20 million, relate primarily to intangible assets ( +\u20ac15 million) property, plant and equipment ( -\u20ac48 million), receivables ( -\u20ac11 million) and liabilities ( +\u20ac25 million).\n\nChanges in deferred tax assets in the prior year, with net disposals of -\u20ac55 million, relate mainly to intangible assets ( -\u20ac27 million), property, plant and equipment (+\u20ac 94 million), provisions ( -\u20ac21 million) and value adjustments ( -\u20ac81 million). Changes in deferred tax liabilities, with net disposals of -\u20ac155 million, relate primarily to property, plant and equipment ( -\u20ac125 million) and receivables ( -\u20ac47 million).\n\nThe VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021. Th e transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 (see Note 5). The assets classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022, inclu de deferred tax liabilities in the amount of \u20ac121 million.\n\n## Global Minimum Tax\n\nAgreements reached at the global level include the introduction of a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent by more than 135 countries. In December 2021, the OECD published a draft legal framework which was then followed by detailed guidelines in March 2022 for use by individual countries that are signatories to the agreement to amend their local tax laws.\n\nThe EU Directive on ensuring this global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large -scale domestic groups came into force in December 2022. The EU member states now have until December 31, 2023, to transpose the Directive into national law.\n\nThe E.ON Group may be subject to minimum tax when changes in the tax laws of the countries in which it operates are in force or are expected to be in force in the near future. However, the statutory tax rate relevant for the E.ON Group is already above 15 percent in all jurisdictions. Consequently, current information does not at present indicate that the E.ON Group will be materially affected by this minimum tax. At the date of approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements for publication, minimum tax legislation is not applicable in any of the countries in which the Group operates. The Management Board is closely monitoring the progress of legislation in each country in which the Group operates.",

The change is primarily attributable to the lower headcount and to lower expenses for pensions. Expenses for restructuring measures also decreased.\n\n## Share -Based Payment\n\nThe expenses for share -based payment in 202 2 (the E.ON Performance Plan) amounted to \u20ac 24.6 million (202 1 : \u20ac61.3 million).\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Program\n\nThe voluntary employee stock purchase program took place again in 2022 , giving employees in the German Group companies the opportunity once again to purchase E.ON shares at favorable conditions. The favorable pricing conditions granted within the framework of the employee stock purchase program (IFRS 2, 'Share -based Payment') resulted in personnel expense of \u20ac 5 million; the offsetting entry was made in equity.\n\n## Longterm Variable Compensation\n\nMembers of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain executives of the E.ON Group receive share -based payment as part of their voluntary long -term variable compensation. The purpose of such compensation is to reward their contribution to E.ON's growth and to further the long -term success of the Company. This variable compensation component, comprising a long -term incentive effect along with a certain element of risk, provides for a logical linking of the interests of shareholders and management.\n\nThe following discussion includes reports on the E.ON Performance Plan introduced in 2017.\n\n## E.ON Performance Plan (EPP)\n\nIn the years 2017 to 2022, E.ON granted the members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain executives of the E.ON Group virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan. The vesting period of each tranche is four years. Vesting periods start on January 1 of each year.\n\nThe beneficiary will receive virtual shares in the amount of the agreed target. The conversion into virtual shares will be based on the fair market value on the date when the shares are granted. The number of virtual shares allocated may change during the four -year vesting period. For tranches granted through 2021, the only relevant criterion was the total shareholder return ('TSR') of E.ON stock compared with the TSR of the companies in a peer group ('relative TSR'). The final number of virtual shares allocated in the 2022 tranche depends on three performance criteria, namely, relative TSR, ROCE, and the E.ON Sustainability Index.\n\nThe TSR is the return on E.ON stock, which takes into account the stock price plus the assumption of reinvested dividends, adjusted for changes in capital. The peer group used for relative TSR will be the other companies in E.ON's peer index, the STOXX \u00ae Europe 600 Utilities. During a tranche's vesting period, E.ON's TSR\n\nperformance is measured once a year in comparison with the companies in the peer group and set for that year.\n\nThe E.ON Sustainability Index reflects the four most relevant ESG aspects (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance) at E.ON. In 2022 these aspects were: climate action, diversity, health and safety, and ESG ratings.\n\nFor the tranches granted up to and including 2021, the final number of virtual shares is determined as follows: E.ON's TSR performance in a given year determines the final number of one -fourth of the virtual shares granted at the beginning of the vesting period. If target attainment in a year is below the threshold defined by the Supervisory Board upon allocation, the number of virtual shares is reduced by one -fourth. If E.ON's performance is at the upper cap or above, the fourth of the virtual shares allocated for the year in question will increase, but to a maximum of 150 percent.\n\nFor the tranche granted in 2022, in addition to TSR (50 percent weighting), ROCE (25 percent weighting) and the E.ON Sustainability Index (25 percent weighting) are also taken into account as performance criteria.\n\nThe resulting number of virtual shares at the end of the vesting period is multiplied by the average price of E.ON stock in the final 60 days of the vesting period. This amount is increased by the dividends distributed on E.ON stock during the vesting period and then paid out. The sum of the payouts is capped at 200 percent of the agreed target.\n\nThe virtual shares are canceled if the employment relationship of the beneficiary ends before the end of the term for reasons within the control of the beneficiary. If the employment relationship of the beneficiary is terminated before retirement, through the end of a limited term or for operational reasons before the end of the term, the virtual shares do not expire but are settled at maturity.",

The same shall apply in the case of a change in control related to E.ON SE and also if the allocating company leaves the E.ON Group before maturity.\n\nThe following are the base parameters of the tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan active in 2022:\n\n## E.ON Performance Plan Virtual Shares\n\n|                          | 6th tranche   | 5th tranche   | 4th tranche   | 3rd tranche   |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Date of issuance         | Jan. 1, 2022  | Jan. 1, 2021  | Jan. 1, 2020  | Jan. 1, 2019  |\n| Term                     | 4 years       | 4 years       | 4 years       | 4 years       |\n| Target value at issuance | \u20ac 12.76       | \u20ac 7.65        | \u20ac 7.88        | \u20ac 6.68        |\n\nThe provision for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan as of the balance sheet date is \u20ac92.9 million (2021: \u20ac89.1 million). The expense for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth tranches amounted to \u20ac24.6 million in the 2022 fiscal year (2021: \u20ac61.3 million).\n\n## Employees\n\nIn 2022 , E.ON employed an average personnel of 68,888 (202 1 : 71,630).

The declaration has been made permanently and publicly accessible to stockholders on the Company's Website (www.eon.com).\n\n## Fees and Services of the Independent Auditor\n\nDuring 2022, the following fees were recorded as expenses for the services provided by the independent auditor of the Consolidated Financial Statements, KPMG and by companies in the international KPMG network:\n\n## Independent Auditor Fees\n\n| \u20ac in millions              | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial statement audits | 32     |     29 |\n| Domestic                   | 23     |     21 |\n| Other attestation services | 6      |      4 |\n| Domestic                   | 6      |      4 |\n| Tax advisory services      | 1      |      1 |\n| Domestic                   | -      |      1 |\n| Other services             | 0      |      0 |\n| Domestic                   | 0      |      0 |\n| Total                      | 39     |     34 |\n| Domestic                   | 29     |     26 |\n\nThe auditor fees relate to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the legally mandated financial statements of E.ON SE and its affiliates. They also include fees for auditing reviews of the IFRS interim financial statements and other audit services directly required by the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe fees for other attestation services include all attestation services that are not auditing services and are not used in connection with the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These costs are for the legally required attestation services and for other voluntary attestation services (e.g., resulting from the audit of sustainability reporting, Renewable Energy Sources Act [EEG] and the Act on Combined Heat and Power Generation [KWKG] and in connection with new IT systems).\n\nThe fees for tax consulting services relate to services in the area of tax compliance at  E.ON units abroad.\n\n## List of Shareholdings\n\nThe list of shareholdings pursuant to Section 313 (2) HGB is an integral part of these Notes to the Financial Statements and is presented in Note 38.\n\n## (14) Earnings per Share\n\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated is shown below:\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\n| \u20ac in  millions                                                                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income/loss from continuing  operations                                                   | 2,242  | 5,305  |\n| Less: Non - controlling interests                                                         | -411   | -614   |\n| Income/loss from continuing  operations (attributable to  shareholders of E.ON SE)        | 1,831  | 4,691  |\n| Income/loss from discontinued  operations, net                                            | -      | -      |\n| Less: Non - controlling interests                                                         | -      | -      |\n| Income/loss from discontinued  operations, net (attributable to  shareholders of E.ON SE) | -      | -      |\n| in \u20ac                                                                                      |        |        |\n| Earnings per share (attributable to  shareholders of E.ON SE)                             |        |        |\n| from continuing operations                                                                | 0.70   | 1.80   |\n| from discontinued operations                                                              | -      | -      |\n| from net income/loss                                                                      | 0.70   | 1.80   |\n| Weighted - average number of  shares outstanding (in millions)                            | 2,609  | 2,608  |\n\nThe computation of diluted earnings per share is identical to that of basic earnings per share because E.ON SE has issued no potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The increase in the weighted -average number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the issue of treasury shares in E.ON SE under the voluntary employee stock purchase program.",

Because there were no binding sales transactions or market prices for the respective cash -generating units in 202 2 , fair values were calculated based on discounted cash flow methods.\n\nValuations are based on the medium -term corporate planning authorized by the Management Board. The calculations for impairment -testing purposes are generally based on the three planning years of the medium -term plan plus two additional detailed planning years. Deviations from this are made in certain justified exceptional cases. The cash flow assumptions extending beyond the detailed planning period are determined using sustainable, currency -specific growth rates based on the analysis of past years and predictions for the future. In 202 2 , the sustainable, currency -specific inflation rate used for the euro area was 1.25 percent (202 1 : 0.5 percent). The discount rates after taxes used for discounting cash flows in the annual impairment test are calculated using market data for each cash -generating unit, and as of the valuation date, ranged between 3.9 and 13.0 percent after taxes (202 1 : between 3. 1 and 8.5 percent).\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the determination by management of recoverable amount are the respective forecasts for E.ON's investment activity, changes in the regu latory framework, as well as for rates of growth and the cost of capital, of revenue and EBITDA margin (in the Customer Solutions business) and Regulatory Asset Base and regulatory return (in the Energy Networks business). The assumptions used in these forecasts regarding the development of commodity market prices, future electricity and gas prices in the wholesale and retail markets are based on external market data from reputable suppliers as well as internal assessments and also appropriately take into a ccount climate -related impacts on market conditions and macroeconomic linkages as well as the sustainability targets anchored in the Group strategy, such as the reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 100 percent by 2050. For example, impacts of climate targets on CO2 prices and changing weather conditions (temperature, wind, etc.) are included. The assumed development of all of the key influencing factors mentioned corresponds to the expectations set out in the forecast report.",

If the goodwill of a cash -generating unit is combined with assets or groups of assets for impairment testing, the assets must be tested first.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nUnlike in the previous year, the goodwill impairment testing performed in 202 2 resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge under IAS 36. Good will of \u20ac4 million was fully impaired in the Customer Solutions Romania cash -generating unit. The new carrying amount of this cash -generating unit based on fair value less costs to sell is \u20ac370 million. An impairment loss was also recognized on the goodwill of the Slovakian operations after they were classified as held for sale under IFRS 5 from the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 5 for more information). This required impairment amounted to approximately \u20ac61 million. It is due to the fact that the fair value less costs of disposal is below the carrying amount of the disposal group. An impairment loss in such a case will always be allocated first to the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the disposal group (see also Note 5).\n\nThe tested goodwill of all cash -generating units whose respective goodwill as of the balance sheet date is material in relation to the total carrying amount of all goodwill shows a surplus of recoverable amounts over the respective carrying amounts and, therefore, based on current assessment of the economic situation, only a significant change in the material valuation parameters that is not considered realistic would necessitate the recognition of goodwill impairment.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIn 2022 , approximately \u20ac 2 million of impairments were recognized on intangible assets.\n\nReversals of impairments on intangible assets only in the amount of \u20ac1 million were recognized in the reporting year.\n\nIn 2022 , the Company recorded an amortization expense on intangible assets of \u20ac714 million (2 021 : \u20ac 850 million).\n\nThe closing balance of intangible assets not subject to amortization amounted to \u20ac30 8 million as of December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac307 million). These assets are mainly attributable to the Energy Networks Germany segment and are largely attributable to easements/rights of way for which the contractual basis does not provide for a time limitation.\n\n\u20ac68 million in research and development costs as defined by IAS 38 were expensed in the reporting year (202 1 : \u20ac59 million).\n\n## Rights of Use\n\nIn 2022 , the Company recorded an amortization expense of \u20ac 393 million (202 1 : \u20ac382 million). Impairment charges on rights of use amounted to \u20ac 3 million (202 1 : \u20ac 1 million).\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nImpairments on property, plant and equipment in 2022 amounted to \u20ac45 million. The two cash -generating units that were most affected were Customer Solutions Germany (\u20ac18 million) and Customer Solutions UK (\u20ac16 million). In the UK, the write -downs primarily related to the full write -off of traditional meters that are no longer needed and which have been replaced by smart energy meters. The impairment loss in the Customer Solutions Germany segment was attributable to various items, primarily generation plants due to lower earnings expectations .\n\nReversals of impairments on property, plant and equipment totaled around \u20ac17 million in the reporting year (2021: \u20ac20 million), of which \u20ac1 6 million related to the Energy Networks Hungary segment due to increased earnings expectations for assets in the distribution network area .\n\nDepreciation amounted to \u20ac2, 219 million in 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac2,490 million).\n\nBorrowing costs in the amount of \u20ac 8 million were capitalized in 2022 (202 1 : \u20ac 7 million) as part of the historical cost of property, plant and equipment.",

These impairments and reversals primarily relate to the first -time application of IAS 29 in Turkey.\n\nIn April 2022, Turkey was classified as a hyperinflationary economy. Consequently, since the second quarter of 2022, the financial statements prepared on the basis of historical cost have been adjusted in accordance with IAS 29 for the first time for two Turkish investees included in the Group using the equity method (joint ventures). Under IAS 29, financial statements in the functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy must be expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. As a result, among other things, non -monetary assets and liabilities are generally adjusted using a general price index and a gain or loss on the net monetary position is recognized. The adjustment under IAS 29 is made on the basis of the consumer price index as of December 31, 2022, published by the Turkish Statistical Institute, which amounted to 1,128.45 index points (June 30, 2022: 977.90; December 31, 2021: 686.95).\n\nThe transition effect as of January 1, 2022, amounted to \u20ac612 million (in foreign currency OCI), partially offset by a write -down in accumulated retained earnings ( -\u20ac381 million).\n\nThe amount shown for non -current securities relates primarily to fixed -income securities.\n\nImpairments on other financial assets amounted to \u20ac 30 million (202 1 : \u20ac29 million). Write -ups totaled \u20ac3 million (202 1 : \u20ac 10 million). The carrying amount of other financial assets with impairment losses was \u20ac3 0 million as of the end of the fiscal year (202 1 : \u20ac 3 million); the carrying amount of the other financial assets written up amounts to \u20ac4 million (202 1 : \u20ac 17 million).",

Disclosures of company names, registered offices and equity interests as required by IFRS 12 for material joint arrangements and associates can be found in the list of shareholdings pursuant to Section 313 (2) HGB (see Note 38).\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 , the investment in Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e. is marketable. The pro rata market value amounted to \u20ac 853 million as of December 31, 2022 (202 1 : \u20ac399 million). The carrying amount is \u20ac 712 million as of December 31, 202 2 . The free float in the company totals 20 percent, with E.ON and Haci \u00d6mer Sabanci Holding A.\u015e. holding half of the remaining shares; from E.ON's perspective, Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e. is therefore a joint venture.\n\nOf investments in companies accounted for under the equity method, the shareholdings in companies with a carrying amount of \u20ac702 million (202 1 : \u20ac129 million) are restricted because it was pledged as collateral for financing as of the balance sheet date.\n\nThere are no further material restrictions apart from those contained in standard legal and contractual provisions.\n\n## Material Joint Ventures-Balance Sheet Data as of December 31\n\n|                                                 | Westconnect GmbH 1   | Westconnect GmbH 1   | Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e.   | Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e.   | Enerjisa \u00dcretim Santralleri A.\u015e.   |   Enerjisa \u00dcretim Santralleri A.\u015e. |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                   | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2022                   | 2021                   | 2022                               |                               2021 |\n| Non- current assets                             | 1,557                | -

Based on this court order , the provision may result in an unjustified loss of potential to reduce a company's corporat e tax that could have been realized at the time of the transition from the 'imputation system' (Anrechnungsverfahren) to the 'half -income system' (Halbeink\u00fcnfteverfahren). The legislator is required to remedy the violation of constitutional law by December 31, 2023 , with retroactive effect. It is not currently clear how the legislator will structure the new regulation.

The reduction in additional paidin capital is attributable to the issue of employee shares to eligible employees of the E.ON Group.\n\n## (22) Retained Earnings\n\nThe following table breaks down the E.ON Group's retained earnings as of the dates indicated:\n\n## Retained Earnings\n\n|                         | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in millions           | 2022           | 2021           |\n| Legal reserves          | 45             | 45             |\n| Other retained earnings | 3,172          | 1,183          |\n| Total                   | 3,217          | 1,228          |\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 , these IFRS retained earnings totaled \u20ac 3,217 million (202 1 : \u20ac1,228 million). The total change of \u20ac 1,989 million is primarily due to the positive consolidated net income. In addition, actuarial gains from pensions led to an increase in retained earnings. This was partially offset by E.O N SE' s distribution to shareholders and the first -time application of IAS 29.\n\nUnder German securities law, E.ON SE shareholders may receive distributions from E.ON SE's income available for distribution in accordance with the German Commercial Code (German GAAP).\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 , these German -GAAP retained earnings totaled \u20ac 2,630 million (202 1 : \u20ac2,619 million). Of this amount, legal reserves of \u20ac45 million (202 1 : \u20ac45 million) are restricted pursuant to Section 150 (3) and (4) AktG. The increase in retained earnings is due to the sale of treasury shares under the employee stock purchase program in 202 2 . In addition, amounts of \u20ac 117.6 million (202 1 : \u20ac161.7 million) are restricted from distribution under German commercial law as a result of the surplus of plan assets and the difference between the recognition of provisions for retirement benefit obligations based on the corresponding average market interest rate over the past ten fiscal years and the recognition of these provisions based on the corresponding average market interest rate over the past seven fiscal years. The dividend -restricted amounts are fully covered by a sufficient amount of available reserves.\n\nThe amount of retained earnings available for distribution is \u20ac2, 467 million (202 1 : \u20ac 2,412 million).\n\nA proposal to distribute a cash dividend for 202 2 of \u20ac0. 51 per share will be submitted to the Annual Shareholders Meeting. For 2021 , shareholders at the May 1 2 , 202 2 , the Annual Shareholders Meeting voted to distribute a dividend of \u20ac0.49 for each dividend -paying ordinary share. Based on a \u20ac 0.51 dividend, the total profit distribution is \u20ac1,331 million (202 1 : \u20ac1,278 million).\n\n## (23) Changes in Other Comprehensive Income\n\nThe change in other comprehensive income is primarily the result o f exchange rate differences recognized on the balance sheet ( -\u20ac732 million) and the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflationary accounting) in Turkey (\u20ac656 million) .\n\nThe table below illustrates the share of OCI attributable to companies accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Share of OCI Attributable to Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method\n\n| \u20ac in millions                             | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of December 31 (before  taxes) | -889   | -2,116 |\n| Taxes                                     | -      | -      |\n| Balance as of December 31 (after  taxes)  | -889   | -2,116 |",

Both defined benefit plans and defined\n\ncontribution plans are in place at E.ON. Benefits under defined benefit plans are generally paid upon reaching retirement age, or in the event of disability or death.\n\nE.ON regularly reviews the pension plans in place within the Group for financial risks. Typical risk factors for defined benefit plans are longevity and changes in nominal interest rates, as well as inflation developments and rising wages and salaries.\n\nThe features and risks of defined benefit plans are shaped by the general legal, tax and regulatory conditions prevailing in the respective country. The configurations of the major defined benefit and defined contribution plans within the E.ON Group are described in the following discussion.\n\n## Germany\n\nActive employees at the German Group companies are covered by both cash balance plans and pension plans based on final salary. Pension plans based on final salary are closed to new hires. All new hires will receive cash balance plans in accordance with a capital or pension module system, which, depending on the pension plan, can provide for alternative payout options of a prorated single p ayment and payments of installments in addition to the payment of a regular pension. The cash balance plans use d different interest rules until December 31, 2021 . Depending on the underlying pension plan, either interest rates adjusted to market developments with a fixed lower limit or guaranteed interest rates were used to determine the capital or pension modules. The majority of pension commitments with a fixed guaranteed interest rate were modified as of January 1, 2022. The pension modules acquired from January 1, 2022, onwards now also bear interest at a rate adjusted to market developments and protected by a fixed lower limit. The pension modules for the prior years remain in place unchanged. The benefit expense for the cash balance plans is determined at different percentage rates based on the ratio between compensation and the contribution limit in the statutory retirement pension system in Germany. Employees can additionally choose to defer compensation. Future pension\n\nadjustments are either guaranteed at 1 percent per annum or largely track the development of the inflation rate, usually in a three -year cycle.\n\nTo fund the pension plans for the German Group companies, plan assets were established. The major part of these plan assets is administered in the form of Contractual Trust Arrangements ('CTAs') in accordance with specified investment principles. There are additional plan assets available through the implementation channels of the pension fund ('Pensionsfonds') and smaller German pension vehicles ('Pensions -und Unterst\u00fctzungskassen'). Only the pension fund and the 'Pensionskassen' vehicles are subject to regulatory provisions in relation to the investment of capital and funding requirements.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are various pension plans. In the past, employees were covered by defined benefit plans, which for the most part were final -pay plans and make up the majority of the pension obligations currently reported for the United Kingdom. Benefit payments to the beneficiaries are adjusted for inflation on a limited basis. These pension plans were closed to new hires. Since then, new hires are offered a defined contribution plan. Aside from the payment of contributions, this plan entails no additional risks for the employer.\n\nPlan assets in the United Kingdom are administered by trustees in independent special -purpose vehicles, most of which are separate sections of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS). The trustees are selected by the members of the plan or appointed by the entity. In that capacity, the trustees are particularly responsible for the investment of the plan assets.\n\nThe Pensions Regulator in the United Kingdom requires that a so -called 'technical valuation' of the plan's funding status be performed every three years. The actuarial assumptions underlying the valuation are agreed upon by the trustees and E.ON UK plc. They include presumed life expectancy, wage and salary",

In fiscal year 2020, the innogy section was transferred to RWE as agreed. At no time was it part of the scope of obligations presented in the E.ON Group. The technical reassessment of the Retail section relevant to the E.ON Group was made on March 31, 2022; as of the reporting date, this assessment has not yet been completed .\n\n## Other Countries\n\nThe remaining pension obligations are divided between the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and the USA.\n\nThe defined benefit plan in the Netherlands consists of commitments made by various employers within the framework of a sector -specific fund and does not permit a pro rata allocation of the obligations, plan assets and service cost. The E.ON Group accordingly accounts for this obligation as a defined contribution plan. There are no minimum funding requirements in this respect. Benefits may be reduced or contributions increased if there is insufficient funding.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Group, however, the benefit plans are relatively insignificant in the above -mentioned countries.",

This investment policy stems from the corresponding governance guidelines of the Group. An increase in the net defined benefit liability or a deterioration in the funded status following an unfavorable development in plan assets or in the present value of the defined benefit obligations is identified in these guidelines as a risk. E.ON therefore regularly reviews the development of the funded status in order to monitor this risk.\n\nTo implement the investment objective, the E.ON Group primarily pursues an investment approach that takes into account the structure of the benefit obligations. This long -term investment\n\nstrategy seeks to manage the funded status, with the result that any changes in the defined benefit obligations, especially those caused by fluctuating inflation and interest rates are, to a certain degree, offset by simultaneous corresponding changes in the fair value of plan assets. The investment strategy may also involve the use of derivatives (for example, interest rate swaps and inflation swaps, as well as currency hedging instruments) to facilitate the control of specific risk factors of pension liabilities. In the table above, derivatives have been allocated, based on their substance, to the respective asset classes. In order to improve the funded status of the E.ON Group as a whole, a portion of the plan assets will also be invested in a diversified portfolio of asset classes that are expected to provide for long -term returns in excess of those of fixed -income investments and the discount rate.\n\nThe determination of the target portfolio structure for the individual plan assets is based on regular asset -liability studies. In these studies, the target portfolio structure is reviewed in a comprehensive approach against the backdrop of existing investment principles, the current funded status, the condition of the capital markets and the structure of the benefit obligations, and is adjusted as necessary. The parameters used in the studies are additionally reviewed regularly, at least once each year. Asset managers are tasked with implementing the target portfolio structure. They are monitored for target achievement on a regular basis.",

As in the prior year, E.ON assumes a 2 percent increase in costs when estimating annual payments. For short -term periods, inflation has resulted in an additional cost increase effect of \u20ac0. 3 billio n being factored into the measurement of provisions. A change in the discount rate or in the cost increase rate of 0.1 percentage points would change the amount of the provision recognized on the balance sheet by approximately \u20ac 50 m illion.\n\nExcluding the effects of discounting and cost increases, the amounts for disposal obligations would be \u20ac7, 102 million with average credit terms of approximately six years.\n\nThere were changes in estimates for the nuclear -power business in 2022 in the amount of -\u20ac965 million (202 1 : -\u20ac338 million). This mainly includes the discounting effect in the amount of \u20ac 1.2 billion resulting from the increase in interest rates and optimization of decommissioning and disposal services and offsetting short -term cost increases in the amount of \u20ac 0.2 billion. \u20ac624 million (202 1 : \u20ac709 million) of this was used, of which \u20ac 562 million (202 1 : \u20ac337 million) related to decommissioning nuclear power plants based on circumstances for which decommissioning and dismantling costs were recognized.\n\n## Personnel Obligations\n\nProvisions for personnel costs primarily cover provisions for early retirement benefits, performance -based compensation components, restructuring and other deferred personnel costs. Rest ructuring provisions, which totaled \u20ac 766 million at December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac1,052 million), were made especially in Germany for various restructuring projects.\n\n## Obligations from Green Certificates\n\nRenewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs or Green Certificates) are an important mechanism for promoting renewable energies, especially in the UK. The ROCs represent a fixed share of Renewables in power sales and can be acquired either from renewable sources or on the market. During a twelve -month ROC period, the obligations recognized as a provision for this purpose are offset against the acquired certificates and used.",

In addition, the provisions for dismantling conventional plant components in the nuclear power segment, which are based on legally binding civil agreements and public provisions, in the amount of \u20ac300 million (202 1 : \u20ac482 million) are taken into account here. The change in this item is mainly due to the increase in interest rates. Excluding discounting and cost -increase effects, the amounts for these disposal obligations with an average payment term of about 16 years would be \u20ac3 21 million.\n\nThe other asset retirement obligations disclosed under economic net debt, not including the provisions for dismantling conventional plant components in the nuclear power segment, amount to \u20ac3 42 million.\n\n## Sales and Supplier -Re lated Obligations\n\nProvisions for supplier -related obligations consist of provisions for potential losses on open purchase contracts.\n\nThe provisions for sales -related obligations include risks of loss for price discounts and from pending sales contracts, as well as for settlement obligations from electricity and gas deliveries already made. The sharp decrease was due to the use of \u20ac7.8 billion as a result of the realization of the underlying transactions. This was partly offset by additions of \u20ac2.2 billion f or contingent losses on pending sales contracts and is related to the rise in energy prices on the commodity markets. These provisions were recognized for contracted sales transactions that form an economic part of a portfolio which are partly offset by procurement transactions to be accounted for as derivative financial instruments. The measurement of these provisions is generally based on the margins of the latest officially valid management planning. Judgment is required in defining the individual sales portfolios and allocating the procurement transactions to these portfolios. In\n\naddition, assumptions regarding the allocation of overheads to the individual sales portfolios and expectations regarding contract terms, particularly in the case of customer contracts with options for unilateral renewal or termination by the customer, are included in the calculation.\n\n## Environmental Remediation and Similar Obligations\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation refer primarily to redevelopment protection measures and the rehabilitation of contaminated sites.\n\n## Other\n\nThe other miscellaneous provisions consist of certain environmental remediation obligations from predecessor companies in the amount of \u20ac0.4 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0. 4 billion), possible obligations from tax -related interest expense in the amount of \u20ac0.1 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0.1 billion) and litigation cost risks in the amount of \u20ac0.1 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0. 1 billion).",

This collateral relates to amounts pledged by banks to limit the utilization of credit lines in connection with the fair value measurement of derivative transactions. The other financial liabilities include, inter alia, financial guarantees totaling \u20ac8 million (202 1 : \u20ac8 million). Also included is collateral received in connection with goods and services in the amount of \u20ac 2 4 million (202 1 : \u20ac1 4 million). E.ON can use this collateral without restriction.\n\nThe financial liabilities of innogy recognized at the date of initial consolidation were marked to market under IFRS. This market value was considerably higher than the nominal value because market interest rates had fallen since the bonds were issued. The difference between the nominal value and the market value calculated during the purchase price all ocation totaled \u20ac 1,668 million as of December 31, 202 2 (as of December 31, 202 1 : \u20ac1,931 million) and will be reversed over the term of each bond and recognized as an expense in the financial result (see Note 10). This difference is not taken into account in the economic net debt.",

In 2022, E.ON also concluded bilateral credit facilities in the amount of just under \u20ac4 billion, with maturities of up to 1.5 years. These facilities were agreed with a significant share of E.ON's core banking group and were not drawn on at any time during the reporting year.\n\n## \u20ac3.5 Bil lion Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility\n\nEffective October 24, 2019, E.ON arranged a syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac3.5 billion over an original term of five years, with two extension options for one year each. After both options are exercised, the term of the credit line will end on October 24, 2026. The credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ra tings are set by three prominent agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI\n\nESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as the Group's reliable, long -term liquidity reserve, one purpose of which is to function as a backup facility for the commercial paper progra ms. The facility was granted by 21 banks, which make up E.ON's core banking group. The facility has not been drawn.\n\n## \u20ac10 Billion and $10 Billion Commercial Paper Programs\n\nThe euro commercial paper program in the amount of \u20ac10 billion allows E.ON SE to issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of up to two years less one day to investors.

As in the prior year, the majority of these were government grants, in particular for the network business. The E.ON Group retains ownership of the assets. The grants are non -refundable and are recognized in other operating income over the period of the depreciable lives of the related assets.\n\nDerivative liabilities totaled \u20ac28,009 million as of December 31, 2022 (202 1 : \u20ac13,118 million). The increase compared with the previous year is mainly due to the market valuation of commodity derivatives.\n\nContract liabilities under IFRS 15 in the amount of \u20ac4,098 million (202 1 : \u20ac3,951 million) consist primarily of construction grants that were paid by customers for the cost of new gas and electricity connections in accordance with the generally binding terms governing such new connections. These grants are customary in the industry, generally nonrefundable and recognized as revenue in the amount of \u20ac3 72 million according to the useful lives of the related assets.\n\nOther operating liabilities consist primarily of other tax liabilities in the amount of \u20ac1, 019 million (202 1 : \u20ac1,559 million) and interest pay able in the amount of \u20ac36 9 million (202 1 : \u20ac3 68 million). This item also includes other liabilities to our customers from overpayments and refund claims of \u20ac 902 million (202 1 : \u20ac467 million) and current personnel liabilities of \u20ac45 8 million (202 1 : \u20ac452 million). Also included in other operating liabilities are carryforwards of counterparty obligations to acquire additional shares in already consolidated subsidiaries as well as non -controlling interests in fully consolidated partnerships with legal\n\nstructures that give their shareholders a statutory right of withdrawal combined with a compensation claim, in the amount of \u20ac555 million (202 1 : \u20ac486 million).\n\n## (28) Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial Obligations\n\nAs part of its business activities, E.ON is su bject to contingent liabilities and other financial obligations involving a variety of underlying matters. These primarily include guarantees, obligations from litigation and claims (as discussed in more detail in Note 29), short - and longterm contractual, legal and other obligations and commitments.\n\n## Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe fair value of the E.ON Group's contingent liabilities was \u20ac0. 3 billion as of December 31, 202 2 (December 31, 202 1 : \u20ac0. 4 billion) and primarily include contingent liabilities in connection with potential longterm environmental remediation measures and legal disputes. This value represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\nE.ON has also issued direct and indirect guarantees and surety bonds to third parties in connection with its own operations or the operations of affiliated companies, which may trigger payment obligations based on the occurrence of certain events. These instruments include both financial guarantees as well as operational guarantees, which primarily secure contractual obligations as well as benefit obligations for active and former employees.\n\nIn addition, E.ON has entered into indemnification agreements, which as a rule are incorporated in agreements concerning the disposal of shareholdings and, above all, affect the customary representations and warranties with relation to liability risks for\n\nenvironmental damage and contingent tax risks. In some cases, obligations are covered in the first instance by provisions of the disposed companies before E.ON itself is required to make any payments. Guarantees issued by companies that were later sold by E.ON SE or its legal predecessors are usually included in the respective final sales contracts in the form of indemnities.\n\nMoreover, E.ON has commitments under which it assumes joint and several liability arising from its interests in civil -law companies ('GbR'), non -corporate commercial partnerships and consortia in which it participates.\n\nThe guarantees of E.ON also include items related to the operation of nuclear power plants. Under the German Nuclear Energy Act ('Atomgesetz' or 'AtG') and the ordinance regulating the provision for coverage under the Atomgesetz ('Atomrechtliche Deckungsvors orgeVerordnung' or 'AtDeckV') of April 27, 2002, German nuclear power plant operators are required to provide nuclear accident liability coverage of up to \u20ac2.5 billion per incident.\n\nThe coverage requirement is satisfied in part by a standardized insurance facility in the amount of \u20ac255.6 million. The institution Nuklear Haftpflicht Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts ('Nuklear Haftpflicht GbR') now only covers costs between \u20ac0.5 million and \u20ac15 million for claims related to officially ordered evacuation measures. Group companies have agreed to place their subsidiaries operating nuclear power plants in a position to maintain a level of liquidity that will enable them at all times to meet their obligations as members of the Nuklear Haftpflicht GbR, in proportion to their shareholdings in nuclear power plants.\n\nTo provide liability coverage for the additional \u20ac2,244.4 million per incident required by the above -mentioned amendments, E.ON Energie AG ('E.ON Energie') and the other parent companies of German nuclear power plant operators reached a Solidarity Agreement ('Solidarvereinbarung') on July 11, July 27, August 2 1, and August 28, 2001, extended by agreement dated March 25, April 18, April 28, and June 1, 2011, and with agreement of",

If an accident occurs, the Solidarity Agreement calls for the nuclear power plant operator liable for the damages to receive -after the operator's own resources and those of its parent companies are exhausted -financing sufficient for the operator to meet its financial obligations. Under the Solidarity Agreement, E.ON Energie's share of the liability coverage on December 31, 202 2 , was 43.3 percent (prior year: 35.1 percent), plus an additional 5.0 percent charge for the administrative costs of processing damage claims. The contract does not provide for a change in share for the 2023 calendar year. Sufficient liquidity has been provided for and is included within the liquidity plan.\n\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2022 , E.ON is continuing to provide collateral in the amount of \u20ac70 0 .8 million (2021: \u20ac701 .8 million) for the former Group companies transferred to RWE which are to be repaid or assumed by RWE Group companies .\n\n## Other Financial Obligations\n\nIn addition to pro visions and liabilities carried on the balance sheet and to reported contingent liabilities, there also are other financial obligations arising mainly from contracts entered into with third parties, or on the basis of legal requirements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 , purchase commitments for investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac 2.3 billion (202 1 : \u20ac1.9 billion). Of these commitments, \u20ac1. 7 billion are due within one year (202 1 : \u20ac1. 3 billion). \u20ac 2.0 billion of the purchase commitment at December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac1. 6 billion) relates to the Energy Networks Germany and Sweden segments.\n\nAdditional contractual obligations in place at the E.ON Group as of December 31, 202 2 , relate primarily to the purchase of electricity and natural gas. Fixed financial obligations under electricity purchase contracts amount to \u20ac 11.3 billion on December 31, 2022 (202 1 : \u20ac 8 .8 billion), of which \u20ac 8.6 billion (202 1 : \u20ac5.8 billion) is due within one year. Financial obligations u nder fixed gas\n\npurchase contracts amount to approximately \u20ac 5.4 billion on December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac 7 .8 billion). Of this amount, \u20ac 4.5 billion (202 1 : \u20ac6.1 billion) is due within one year. Additional fixed purchase commitments as of December 31, 202 2 , amoun t to \u20ac0.7 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0.6 billion). They essentially include longterm contractual commitments to purchase heat and alternative fuels. Of these commitments, \u20ac0. 2 billion (202 1 : \u20ac0.1 billion) are due within one year. There are also additional purchase commitments whose amount is not fixed yet .\n\nOther financial obligations exist only to an insignificant extent. These include capital commitments in connection with joint ventures, obligations concerning the acquisition of financial assets, and obligations arising from capital measures.\n\n## (29) Litigation and Claims\n\nA number of different court actions, governmental investigations and proceedings, and other claims are currently pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against companies of the E.ON Group. This in particular includes legal actions and proceedings on contract amendments and price adjustments initiated in response to market upheavals and the changed economic and geopolitical situation in the electricity and gas sectors (also as a consequence of the energy transition and the energy crisis) and concerning price increases and anticompetitive practices. The courts and authorities are also subjecting competitive practices to stricter reviews.\n\nIn the Energy Networks segment, Group companies are involved in proceedings for the award of concessions and in connection with grid connections and the calculation of the grid fee. Official regulations, approvals and changes in regulatory practice have given rise to legal disputes. Of particular note here are effects in connection with the regulatory treatment of capital costs, return on equity and other key regulatory parameters. The national regulatory regimes within Europe are subject to changes, some of which have a significant impact on network operations. Owing to a\n\nnumber of factors, including regulatory and legal decisions, the regulatory framework has increased here. However, these regulatory interventions are not restricted to the network area; distribution activities in the customer solutions area have also been affected by regulatory measures, in Germany including in connection with electricity self -generation models seeking to be exempted from the payment of the EEG surcharge.\n\nThe changes to the legal and regulatory framework can in some cases also significantly impact subsidies and remuneration practices in the area of Renewables, which in turn are the object of regulatory or court proceedings.\n\nSharply rising energy prices in Europe have been leading to market distortions, to which member states have been increasingly responding with regulatory measures, such as price caps for electricity and gas. In some countries, rising energy prices are responsible fo r occasional insolvencies of energy supply companies, and suspension of energy deliveries. In some cases, the insolvencies of other suppliers lead to an increase in customers (due to regulatory effects) at E.ON Group companies.\n\nThere are also legal disputes in connection with completed M&A activities, in particular as a result of the acquisition of innogy SE.\n\nNo further action was taken in the test case brought by PreussenElektra GmbH regarding the calculation of interest on the nuclear fuel tax paid by E.ON due to a lack of prospects of success.\n\n## (30) Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures\n\nIn the current fiscal year, E.ON made no external payments for additions to consolidated shareholdings and activities (2021: \u20ac0 million).\n\nThe total consideration received by E.ON in 2022 on the disposal of consolidated equity interests and activities generated cash",

Cash and cash equivalents disposed of amounted to \u20ac3 million (2021: \u20ac71 million). The sale of the consolidated activities led to reductions of \u20ac855 million (2021: \u20ac1,261 million) in assets and \u20ac55 million (2021: \u20ac689 million) in provisions and liabilities. This in particular relates to the sale of 50% of the shares in Westconnect GmbH. The remaining 50% is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method.\n\nAt \u20ac11.5 billion, cash provided by operating activities before interest and taxes from continuing operations was \u20ac5.9 billion higher than in the prior year (\u20ac5.6 billion). Energy Networks reco rded a significant increase of +\u20ac2.3 billion to \u20ac7 billion, in particular as a result of higher cash -effective earnings and positive changes in working capital in the German energy network. Cash provided by operating activities before interest and taxes in Customer Solutions also increased by \u20ac1.9 billion to \u20ac2.4 billion, with both the UK and German businesses contributing to this development. The impact of the energy price crisis varied greatly from market to market depending on whether government support was granted or not, and in some cases these effects offset each other. In particular, cash provided by operating activities in the United Kingdom was \u20ac1.3 billion higher than in the previous year. This will lead to correspondingly lower incoming customer p ayments in subsequent quarters. The shutdown of power plants reduced the operating cash flow of the non -core business by \u20ac0.8 billion. Corporate Functions/Other's operating cash flow was about \u20ac2.4 billion above the prior -year level, primarily because of internal settlements between E.ON Energy Markets GmbH and the segments due to the central procurement of power and gas .\n\nCash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac3.1 billion was \u20ac2.3 billion above the prior -year figure of -\u20ac5.4 billion. This development is primarily attributable to a change in the balance of cash inflows and outflows on commodity futures transactions. Investments and disposals were at the prior -year level. Disposals include in particular a payment inflow from\n\nthe partial sale of Westconnect GmbH. Activities in Hungary were among those divested in the 2021 financial year.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac3.1 billion was \u20ac5.4 billion below the prior -year figure of \u20ac2.3 billion. The net of the issuance and repayment of bonds, commercial paper, and bank liabilities in the year under review had an adverse impact on cash provided by financing activities, as did the balance of cash inflows and outflows on margins resulting from the settlement of derivative transactions.\n\n## Supplemental Information on Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\n| \u20ac in millions                    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Income taxes paid (less refunds) | -594    | -652    |\n| Interest paid                    | - 1,091 | - 1,078 |\n| Interest received                | 219     | 160     |\n| Dividends received               | 575     | 559     |",

E.ON also hedges net investments in foreign operations.\n\nIn the commodity sector, fluctuations in future cash flows from procurement and sales transactions are economically hedged by offsetting transactions. Hedge accounting was applied in individual cases with regard to hedging electricity price change risks.\n\nTo hedge currency risk, E.ON entered into hedging transactions in the reporting year in pounds sterling at an average hedging rate of \u00a30. 91 /\u20ac (202 1 : \u00a30. 88/\u20ac) and in U S dollars at an average hedging rate of US$1.36/\u20ac (202 1 : US$1.36/\u20ac). Hedging transactions were concluded at an average interest rate of 2.67 percent (202 1 : 3.23 percent) to hedge the interest rate risk in the eurozone.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against the risk from changes in market values. Gains and losses on these hedges are generally reported in that line item of the income statement which also includes the respective hedged items.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are used to protect against the risk arising from variable cash flows. Interest rate swaps and cross -currency interest rate swaps are the principal instruments used to limit interest rate and currency risks. The purpose of these swaps is to\n\nmaintain the level of payments arising from long -term interest -bearing rec eivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and euro s by using cash flow hedge accounting in the functional currency of the respective E.ON company. Futures contracts are concluded to reduce future cash flow fluctuations arising from electricity transactions effected at variable spot prices. Cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the risk of changes in electricity prices was prospectively terminated during the fiscal year due to a restructuring of the procurement chain. The following table presents the carrying amounts of the hedging instruments and the changes in the fair values of the hedging instruments and hedged items by hedged risk type:\n\n## Carrying Amounts of Hedging Instruments and Changes in Fair Value of Hedging Instruments and Hedged Items in Connection with Cash Flow Hedges\n\n|                               | Receivables from   |   Receivables from | Carrying amount Liabilities from  derivative financial  instruments   | Carrying amount Liabilities from  derivative financial  instruments   |   Change in the fair value of  t he designated portion of  hedging instruments |   Change in the fair value of  t he designated portion of  hedging instruments |   Change in the fair value  of hedged items |   Change in the fair value  of hedged items |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                 | 2022               |               2021 | 2022                                                                  | 2021                                                                  |                                                                           2022 |                                                                           2021 |                                        2022 |                                        2021 |\n| Currency risk                 | 408                |                372 | 107                                                                   | 88                                                                    |                                                                            100 |                                                                            327 |                                         -99 |                                        -329 |\n| In terest - rate risk         | 66                 |                 50 | 465                                                                   | 1,299                                                                 |                                                                            816 |                                                                            291 |                                        -827 |                                        -338 |\n| Electricity price change risk | -                  |                 62 | -                                                                     | 33                                                                    |                                                                            676 |                                                                             27 |                                        -676 |                                         -27 |\n\nThe total amount of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges recorded for the year ended December 31, 202 2 , produced income of \u20ac3 million (202 1 : income of \u20ac21 million) resulting from exchange rate hedging.\n\nGains and losses from the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are classified as other operating income or other operating expenses.",

The fair values of the designated portion of the hedging instruments changed by \u20ac 304 million in the reporting period (202 1 : \u20ac41 million).\n\nAs in 202 1 , no ineffectiveness resulted from net investment hedges in 202 2.\n\nThe development of OCI arising from net investment hedges is as follows:\n\n## Changes in OCI Arising from Net Investment Hedges\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                      | Currency risk   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Balance as of January 1, 2021                      | 265             |\n| Unrealized changes - hedging reserve               | -47             |\n| Unrealized changes - reserve for hedging costs     | 6               |\n| Reclassification adjustments recognized in  income | -               |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | -4              |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2021 1                  | 220             |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2022                      | 220             |\n| Unrealized changes - hedging reserve               | 322             |\n| Unrealized changes - reserve for hedging costs     | -18             |\n| Reclassification adjustments recognized in  income | -               |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | -               |\n| Income taxes                                       | -170            |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022 1                  | 354             |\n\n1 As of December 31, 2022, includes -\u20ac71 million (2021: -\u20ac71 million) from terminated net investment hedges.\n\nAs a rule, reclassification adjustments recognized in income are reported under other operating income and expenses. The nominal volume of hedging instruments in net investment hedges amounted to \u20ac 4,759 million as of December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac5,082 million). Since the currency risk of net investment hedges is hedged through the ongoing rollover of the hedging instruments, the majority are concluded with a remaining term of less than one year.\n\n## Valuation of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is sensitive to movements in underlying market rates and other relevant variables. The Company assesses and monitors the fair value of derivative instruments on a periodic basis. The fair value to be determined for each derivative instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (exit price). E.ON also takes into account the counterparty credit risk for both own credit risk (debt value adjustment) and the risk of the corresponding counterparty (credit value adjustment) when determining fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using common market valuation methods with reference to available market data on the measurement date.\n\nThe following is a summary of the methods and assumptions for the valuation of utilized derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Currency, electricity and gas forward contracts, swaps, and emissions -related derivatives are valued separately at their forward rates and prices as of the balance sheet date. Whenever possible, forward rates and prices are based on market quotations, with any applicable forward premiums and discounts taken into consideration.",

Discounted cash values are determined for interest rate, cross -currency and cross -currency interest rate swaps for each individual transaction as of the balance sheet date. Interest income and expenses are recognized in income at the date of payment or accrual.\n- \u00b7 Equity forwards are valued on the basis of the stock prices of the underly ing equities, taking into consideration any timing components.\n- \u00b7 Exchange -traded futures and option contracts are valued individually at daily settlement prices determined on the futures markets that are published by their respective clearing houses. Paid in itial margins are disclosed under other assets. Variation margins received or paid during the term of such contracts are stated under other liabilities or other assets, respectively, unless they are offset against the recognized market values of the commodity derivatives, as the offsetting criteria of IAS 32.42 are met.\n- \u00b7 Certain longterm energy contracts are valued with the aid of valuation models that use internal data if market prices are not available. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in these internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date would lead to a theoretical change in market values of \u00b1\u20ac44 million.\n\n## (32) Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amounts of the financial instruments, their grouping into IFRS 9 measurement categories, their fair values and their measurement sources by class are presented in the following table:",

Any necessary discounting takes place using current market interest rates over the remaining terms of the financial instruments. The determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 31.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, E.ON assesses whether there might be grounds for reclassification between hierarchy levels. In 2022 , due to reduced price quotes, securities with a fair value of \u20ac175 million were reclassified from hierarchy level 1 to hierarchy\n\nlevel 2. Investments with a fair value of \u20ac117 million were reclassified from hierarchy level 2 to hierarchy level 3 because fair values can no longer derived from market values and instead wer e determined using valuation techniques. Derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value of \u20ac34 million were also classified in measurement level 3 because their fair value cannot be derived from market values but instead is determined on the b asis of internal parameters.\n\nThe input parameters of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for equity investments are specified taking into account economic developments and available industry and corporate data (see also\n\nNote 1). A hypothetical change of + 10 percent or -10 percent in these key internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date would lead to a theoretical change in market values of +\u20ac24 million or -\u20ac16 million, respectively. A change of +10 percent or -10 percent i n the key internal measurement parameters of other financial receivables as of the balance sheet date would result in a theoretical increase in fair values of +\u20ac3 million or a decrease of -\u20ac4 million, respectively. The fair values determined using valuation techniques for financial instruments carried at fair value are reconciled as shown in the following table:\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Level 3 Reconciliation\n\n|                                  |              |                                   |                               |             |                                    | Transfers     | Transfers      |                             |                |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                    | Jan. 1, 2022 | Purchases  (including  additions) | Sales  (including  disposals) | Settlements | Gains/losses  in income  statement | into  Level 3 | out of Level 3 | Exchange  rate  differences | Dec. 31,  2022 |\n| Equity investments               | 289          | 73                                | -47                           | 0           | -47                                | 117           | -              | 3                           | 388            |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 43           | -435                              | 19                            | 8           | 1                                  | -34           | -              | -                           | -398           |\n| Other financial receivables      | 123          | -                                 | -                             | -15         | -6                                 | -             | -              | -                           | 102            |\n| Total                            | 455          | -362                              | -28                           | -7          | -52                                | 83            | -              | 3                           | 92             |",

If there is also currently a legal right to set off and the intention is to settle on a net basis, offsetting is mandatory in accordance with IAS 32.\n\nThe netting agreements are derived from netting clauses contained in master agreements including those of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the German Master Agreement for Financial Derivatives Transactions (DRV), the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET) and the Financial Energy Master Agreement (FEMA).\n\nCollateral pledged to and received from financial institutions in relation to these liabilities and assets limits the utilization of credit lines in the fair value measurement of interest -rate and currency derivatives, and is shown in the table.\n\nThe following two tables illustrate the contractually agreed (undiscounted) cash outflows arising from the liabilities included in the scope of IFRS 7:\n\n## Cash Flow Analysis as of December 31, 2022\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                    | Cash outflows  2022   | Cash outflows  2023   | Cash outflows  2024-2026   | Cash outflows  from  2027   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Bonds                                                            | 5,299                 | 3,021                 | 7,371                      | 20,207                      |\n| Commercial paper                                                 | 767                   | -

This amount is the maximum amount that E.ON would have to pay in the event of claims on the guarantees. E.ON has recognized a liability for this in the amount of \u20ac8 million (202 1 : \u20ac8 million).\n\nFor financial liabilities that bear floating interest rates, the rates that were fixed on the balance sheet date are used to calculate future interest payments for subsequent periods as well. Financial liabilities that can be terminated at any time are assigned to the earliest maturity band in the same way as put options that are exercisable at any time.\n\nIn gross -settled derivatives (usually currency derivatives and commodity derivatives), outflows are accompanied by related inflows of funds or commodities.\n\nThe net gains and losses from financial instruments by IFRS 9 category are shown in the following table:\n\n## Net Gains and Losses by Category\n\n| \u20ac in millions                        | 2022   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Financial assets Amortized Cost      | -310   | -266    |\n| Financial liabilities Amortized Cost | -512   | - 1,179 |\n| Fair Value through P&L               | 3,438  | 18,651  |\n| Fair Value through OCI               | -5     | 50      |\n| Total                                | 2,611  | 17,256  |\n\nThe net result of the category fair value through OCI results in particular from currency translation effects, interest income and losses from the sale of fair value through OCI securities.\n\nIn addition to impairments of financial assets, net gains and losses in the amortized cost category are due primarily to interest income from financial assets and liabilities and effects from the currency translation of financial liabilities.\n\nThe net gains and losses in the fair value through profit or loss measurement category encompass both the changes in fair value from derivative financial instruments and from equity instruments, and gains and losses on realization. The dec rease in net results was due in particular to the fact that expenses from the fair value measurement of commodity derivatives increased significantly more than income from the fair value measurement of these financial instruments .\n\n## Impairments of Financial Assets\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets must be recognized not only for losses already incurred but also for expected future cr edit losses. E.ON takes into account expected future credit losses of financial assets carried at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and receivables from finance leases.\n\nFor trade receivables, expected credit losses are recognized over their entire residual term using the simplified method (lifetime expected credit loss [ECL] trade receivables). For other financial assets, E.ON first determines the credit loss expected within the first twelve  months (stage 1 -12 month ECL). In derogation of this, in the event of a significant increase in the default risk, the expected credit loss over the entire residual term of the respective instrument is recognized (stage 2 -lifetime ECL). Whether the default risk has increased significantly depends largely on the counterparty risk as calculated internally on initial recognition. E.ON uses an 18 -point internal rating scale to monitor counterparty risk. A significant increase in the default risk is assumed at the earliest after a three -level decline in the rating (since initial recognition). If there are objective indications of an actual default, an individual impairment loss must be recognized on the income statement (stage 3 -losses already incurred).\n\nE.ON distinguishes between two approaches when calculating expected future credit losses. If external or internal rating information is available, the expected credit loss for trade receivables and other financial assets is determined on the basis of this data. If no rating information is available, E.ON determines default ratios for trade receivables on the basis of historical default rates, taking into account forward -looking information on economic developments. In the E.ON Group, a default or the classification of a receivable as uncollect a ble is assumed after 180, 270 or 360 days, depending on the region.\n\nIn 2022, valuation allowances for trade receivables changed as shown in the following table:\n\n## Valuation Allowances for Trade Receivables\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1   | -1,253 | -1,239 |\n| Disposals                 | 259    | 337    |\n| Impairments               | -657   | -315   |\n| Other 1                   | 39     | -36    |\n| Balance as of December 31 | -1,612 | -1,253 |\n\n1 The item Other includes currency translation differences.\n\nThere were no significant changes in valuation allowances in 2022 for other financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, or for receivables from finance leases.",

Prior to the interest rate benchmark reform, the collateral balance generally accrued interest on the basis of the Euro Overnight Index Average, which was affected by the reform. The conversion of the affected agreement to interest at the Euro Short -Term Rate was fully completed on January 6, 2022.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Principles\n\nThe prescribed processes, responsibilities and actions concerning financial and risk management are described in detail in internal risk management guidelines applicable throughout the Group. The units have developed additional guidelines of their own within the confines of the Group's overall guidelines. To ensure efficient risk management at the E.ON Group, the Trading (Front Office), Financ e Controlling (Middle Office) and Financial Settlement (Back Office) departments are organized as strictly separate units. Risk steering and r eporting in the areas of interest rates, currencies and credit for banks and liquidity management is performed by the Financ e Controlling department (in the credit area, also in part by Counterparty Risk Management), while risk steering and reporting in th e area of commodities and in the credit area for industrial enterprises is performed at Group level by a separate department.\n\nE.ON uses a Group -wide treasury, risk management and reporting system. This system is a standard information technology solution t hat is fully integrated and is continuously updated. The system is designed to provide for the analysis and monitoring of the E.ON Group's exposure to liquidity, foreign exchange and interest risks. On a Groupwide basis, Financ e Controlling/Counterparty R isk Management monitors and steers credit risks for banks, and Counterparty Risk Management monitors and steers corporates of a certain materiality. These activities are carried out each using a standard software package.",

Liquidity Management\n\nThe primary objectives of liquidity management at E.ON consist of ensuring ability to pay at all times, the timely satisfaction of contractual payment obligations and the optimization of costs within the E.ON Group.\n\nCash pooling and external financing are largely centralized at E.ON SE and cer tain financing companies. Funds are provided to the other Group companies as needed on the basis of an 'in -house banking' solution.\n\nE.ON SE determines the Group's financing requirements on the basis of short -and medium -term liquidity planning. The financi ng of the Group is controlled and implemented on a forward -looking basis in accordance with the planned liquidity requirement or surplus. Relevant planning factors taken into consideration include operating cash flow, capital expenditures, divestments, mar gin payments and the maturity of bonds and commercial paper.\n\n## 2. Price Risks\n\nIn the normal course of business, the E.ON Group is exposed to risks arising from price changes in foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities and asset management. These risks create volatility in earnings, equity, debt and cash flows from period to period. E.ON has developed a variety of strategies to limit or eliminate these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, among others.\n\n## 3. Credit Risks\n\nE.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through the use of financial instruments. Uniform credit risk management\n\nprocedures are in place throughout the Group to identify, measure and steer credit risks.\n\nThe following discussion of E.ON's risk management activities and the estimated amounts generated from value -atrisk ('VaR') and sensitivity analyses are 'forward -looking statements' that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to actual, unforeseeable developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by the Company to analyze risks should not be considered forecasts of future events or losses. For example, E.ON faces certain risks that are either nonfinancial or no nquantifiable. Such risks principally include country risk, operational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk, which are not represented in the following analyses.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nE.ON SE is responsible for controlling the currency risks to which the E.ON Group is exposed.\n\nBecause it holds interests in businesses outside of the euro area, currency translation risks arise within the E.ON Group. Fluctuations in exchange rates produce accounting effects attributable to the translation of the balance sheet and income statement items of the foreign consolidated Group companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Translation risks are hedged through borrowing in the corresponding local currency, which may also include shareholder loans in foreign currency. In addition, derivative and nonderivative financial instruments are employed as needed. The hedges qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Group's translation risks are reviewed at regular intervals and the level of hedging is adjusted whenever necessary. The respective debt factor, net assets and the enterprise value denominated in the foreign currency are the principal criteria governing the level of hedging.\n\nThe E.ON Group is also exposed to operating and financial transaction risks attributable to foreign currency transactions. The\n\nsubsidiaries are responsible for managing their operating currency risks and are generally required to hedge their currency risks through E.ON S E. E.ON SE coordinates hedging throughout the Group companies and makes use of external derivatives as needed. It may either directly close out foreign currency positions that have been tendered, in whole or in part, through external transactions, or keep the position open within approved limits. The one -day value -atrisk (95 percent confidence) for transactional foreign currency positions totaled \u20ac0.7 million as of December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac0. 6 million) and is mainly determined by the currencies Czech koruna, Hungarian forint and Swedish krona.\n\nFinancial transaction risks result from payments originating from financial receivables and payables. They are generated both by external financing in a variety of foreign currencies, and by shareholder loans from within the Group denominated in foreign currency. Financial transaction risks are generally hedged.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nE.ON is exposed to profit risks arising from floating -rate financial liabilities and future (re)financing needs. Positions based on fixed interest rates, on the other hand, are subject to changes in fair value resulting from the volatility of market interest rates. E.ON seeks a balanced maturity profile. This is influenced, among other factors, by the type of business model, existing liabilities as well as the regulatory framework in which E.ON operates. Interest rate derivatives are also used to manage interest rate risk.\n\nWith interest rate derivatives included, the share of financial liabilities with floating interest rates or with maturities of less than 12 months was 0 percent as of December 31, 2022 (202 1 : 1 2 percent). The volume -weighted average interest rate of the financial liabilities, including interest rate derivatives, was 2. 7 percent as of December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : 2.6 percent).\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 , the E.ON Group held interest rate derivatives with a nominal value of \u20ac6,263 million (202 1 : \u20ac4,016 million).",

This measure is used for internal risk controlling and reflects the economic position of the E.ON Group. A one-percentage-point upward or downward change in interest rates (across all currencies) would raise or lower interest charges by \u00b1\u20ac8.0 million (202 1 : \u00b1\u20ac26.2 million) in the subsequent fiscal year.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk Management\n\nThe E.ON portfolio of physical assets, long -term contracts and endcustomer sales is exposed to substantial risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. The principal commodity prices to which E.ON is exposed relate, in particular, to electricity, gas, green and emission certificates.\n\nThe objective of commodity risk management is to transact through physical and financial contracts to optimize the value of the portfolio while reducing the potential negative deviation from target EBIT.\n\nIn the normal course of business of the underlying energy production and retail sales activities, E.ON's individual management units are exposed to uncertain commodity market prices, which impacts operating gains and costs. All external trading on commodity markets must be related to reducing open commodity positions and be undertaken in strict accordance with approved commodity hedging strategies.\n\nDue to the primary focus on procurement and purely hedging transactions, the allocation of risk capital is no longer necessary. The processes and operational management models within the trading system are monitored by the local market risk teams and centrally managed by the Risk Management department.\n\nFollowing the spinoff of Uniper, E.ON established its own procurement organization for the distribution business and secured market access for the output of the remaining energy production in order to appropriately manage the res idual\n\ncommodity risks. In addition, E.ON has established a subsidiary, E.ON Energy Markets GmbH (EEM), which acts as a central interface to the wholesale markets. The main function of EEM is to consolidate E.ON's commodity positions in order to diversify a nd reduce credit and margin risks.\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 , the E.ON Group primarily held electricity and gas derivatives with a nominal value of \u20ac 13 6, 765 million (202 1 : \u20ac31,512 million). Electricity derivatives account for \u20ac66,648 million (2021: \u20ac23,357 million) of this amount and gas derivatives for \u20ac70,055 million (2021: \u20ac7,961 million).\n\nA key foundation of the commodity risk management system is the Groupwide Commodity Risk Policy and the corresponding internal policies of the units. These specify the control principles for commodity risk management, minimum required standards and clear management and operational responsibilities.\n\nCommodity exposures and risks are reported across the Group on a monthly basis to the members of the Risk Committee. A repor t on complex weather risks is prepared once each quarter.\n\nA hypothetical change in market prices at the reporting date of +10 percent or -10 percent would result in a theoretical increase in fair value and recognition in income in the amount of +\u20ac 1,338 million or a decrease in fair value and recognition in expense in the amount of -\u20ac 1,338 million for the electricity derivatives (2021: \u00b1\u20ac 1,299 million). A corresponding hypothet ical change would result in a theoretical increase in fair value and recognition in income in the amount of \u20ac 810 million or a decrease in fair value and recognition in expense in the amount of \u20ac 810 million for gas derivatives (2021: \u00b1\u20ac 1,419 million).\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nIn order to minimize credit risk arising from operating activities and from the use of financial instruments, the Company enters into transactions only with counterparties that satisfy the Company's internally established minimum requirements. Maximum credit\n\nrisk is confined by credit limits based on internal and (where available) external credit ratings. The setting and monitoring of credit limits is subject to certain minimum requirements, which are based on Groupwide credit risk management guidelines. Long -term operating contracts and asset management transactions are not comprehensively included in this process. They are monitored separately at the level of the responsible units.\n\nIn principle, each Group company is responsible for mana ging credit risk in its operating activities. Depending on the nature of the operating activities and the credit risk, additional credit risk monitoring and controls are performed both by the units and by Corporate Headquarters. Regular reports on credit limits, including their utilization, are submitted to the Risk Committee. Intensive, standardized monitoring of quantitative and qualitative early -warning indicators, as well as close monitoring of the credit quality of counterparties, enable E.ON to act early in order to minimize risk.\n\nTo the extent possible, collateral is negotiated with counterparties for the purpose of reducing credit risk. Accepted as collateral are primarily guarantees issued by the respective parent companies, letters of comfort or evidence of profit and loss transfer agreements in combination with letters of awareness. To a lesser extent, the Company also requires bank guarantees and deposits of cash and securities as collateral to reduce credit risk. Risk -management collateral in the forms mentioned above totaling \u20ac61.0 billion (202 1 : \u20ac59.3 billion) was used for setting limits. Due to the continued high price levels on wholesale markets during 2022 , the eligible collateral of individual parent companies of our counterparties also remained at a high level and was taken into account.\n\nDerivative transactions are generally executed on the basis of standard agreements that allow for the netting of all open transactions with individual counterparties. To further reduce credit risk, bilater al margining agreements are entered into with selected banks. Limits, which are regularly monitored, are imposed",

The systematic management of liquidity risk remains an important component of risk management at E.ON, particularly against the backdrop of the current high level of energy price volatility. Consequently, the rise in energy prices since summer 2021 has increased credit risks from pending procurement contracts.\n\nThere is no credit risk with respect to the exchange -traded forward and option contracts with an aggregate nominal value of \u20ac37,086 million as of December 31, 202 2 (202 1 : \u20ac4,109 million). For the remaining financial instruments, the maximum risk of default is equal to their nominal amounts.\n\nAt E.ON, liquid funds are normally invested at banks with good credit ratings, in money market funds with first -class ratings or in short -term securities (for example, commercial paper) of issuers with strong credit ratings. Bonds of public and private issuers are also selected for investment. Group companies that for legal reasons are not included in the cash pool invest money at leading local banks. Standardized credit assessment and limit -setting is complemented by daily monitoring of CDS levels at the banks and at other significant counterparties.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nFor the purpose of financing long -term payment obligations, including those relating to asset retirement obligations (see Note 26 ) and cash investments, financial investments totaling \u20ac2. 4 billion (202 1 : \u20ac 2.9 billion) were held predominantly by German E.ON Group companies as of December 31, 202 2 . Isolated withdrawals were offset by positive performance.\n\nThese financial assets are invested on the basis of an accumulation strategy (total -return approach), with investments broadly diversified across the various asset classes, for example the money market, bond and equity asset classes, as well as alternative asset classes like real estate. The majority of the assets are held in investment funds managed by external fund managers. Corporate Asset Management at E.ON SE, which is part of the Company's Finance Department, is responsible for continuous monitoring of overall risks and those concerning individual fund managers. The three -month VaR with a 98 -percent confidence interval for these financial assets was \u20ac 166 million (202 1 : \u20ac100 million).\n\nThe liquidation of Versorgungskasse Energie VVaG (VKE i. L.) was almost complete as of December 31, 202 2 . Financial investments under management amounted to \u20ac 51.9 million as of December 31, 2022 (202 1 : \u20ac53.4 million). The company was deconsolidated on June 30, 2019.",

Leases are recognized in accordance with the right -of -use model as set out in IFRS 16. The tables in Note 15 present the development of the right -of -use assets by asset class. The net carrying amount of the rights of use at the balance sheet date of December 31, 202 2 , in the amount of \u20ac 2,377 million (202 1 : \u20ac2,424 million) decreased year -on-year by \u20ac47 million (202 1 : \u20ac119 million). Depreciation of right -of -use assets in the am ount of \u20ac 390 million (202 1 : \u20ac382 million) remained nearly constant compared with the prior year.\n\nTo ensure operative flexibility, in particular for real estate leases extension and termination options are included in the agreements. In determining the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and circumstances that have an impact on the exercise of an extension option or the non -exercise of a termination option. In the determination of the lease liability, and correspondingly, of the right -of -use assets, all rea sonably certain cash outflows are taken into consideration. As of December 31, 202 2 , potential future cash outflows in the amount of \u20ac 235 million (202 1 : \u20ac133 million) were not included in the lease liability as it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be renewed or not terminated. Possible future cash outflows for lease agreements that can be terminated without penalty by either party, subject to certain deadlines, are not included in this amount due to higher levels of uncertainty. Variable lease payments occur in only immaterial amounts and E.ON generally does not issue residual value guarantees. Leases not yet commenced to which E.ON as a lessee is committed result in potential future cash outflows over the expected lease terms of \u20ac110 million (2 021 : \u20ac348 million). The majority of this relates to future rental payments for the new office building of E.ON Sverige AB in Malm\u00f6, which is scheduled to be occupied in 2023. The figure reported in 2021 included leases in connection with network cooperation agreements at Westenergie AG that\n\ncommenced on January 1, 2022. The existing lease liabilities do not contain any covenant clauses that are linked to financial ratios.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date of December 31, 202 2 , right -of -use assets are offset by lease liabilities with a present value of \u20ac2, 512 million (202 1 : \u20ac2,539 million) recognized under financial liabilities (see Note 27); the short -term portion of the lease liabilities totals \u20ac367 million (202 1 : \u20ac355 million). The maturity structure of the future payment obligations from leases is presented in Note 32.\n\nDue to the practical expedients used, the recognition of a right -of -use asset is not necessary for low -value leases and leases with a lease term of less than twelve months. Instead, a lease expense is recognized in these cases. The following amounts are recognized in the income statement in connection with leases in the fiscal year:\n\n## E.ON as Lessee - Effects within the Income Statement\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expenses from short term leases (< 12 months)                      | 36     | 12     |\n| Expense for low - value leases not included in short - term leases | 11     | 19     |\n| Expense from variable lease payments                               | 14     | 10     |\n| Interest expense from leasing                                      | 162    | 160    |\n| Income from subleases                                              | -      | -      |\n| Gain/Loss from sale and leaseback transactions                     | -6     | 9      |",

This includes the lease expense for short -term and low -value leases as well as the expense from variable lease payments and interest expense for the period. Payments allocated to the amortization of the lease liability are recognized in cash flows from financing activities in the amount of \u20ac 357 million (202 1 : \u20ac363 million).\n\n## E.ON as Lessor\n\nE.ON enters into lease agreements as a lessor to a limited extent. Finance leases include technical equipment and machinery, in particular generation plants, that have been transferred to customers for use. Operating leases include assets that have been transferred for use, in particular real estate, heat and electricity generation plants and lines. There are no material risks in connection with rights retained to the assets temporarily transferred for use, with the result that risk management strategies, in particular, are not necessary. Residual -value guarantees are only entered into on an individual basis for purposes of additional hedging.\n\nThe present value of minimum lease payments is recognized under receivables from finance leases (see Note 18). The short -term portion totals \u20ac 33 million (202 1 : \u20ac44 million). There were no material changes to net investments in the period under review.\n\nThe nominal and present values of the lease payments had the following maturities:\n\n## E.ON as Lessor - Finance Leases\n\n|                          |   Undiscounted lease  payments |   Undiscounted lease  payments |   Unrealized interest |   Unrealized interest | Discounted non - guaranteed residual  value   | Discounted non - guaranteed residual  value   |   Present value of  minimum lease  payments |   Present value of  minimum lease  payments |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac in millions            |                           2022 |                           2021 |                  2022 |                  2021 | 2022                                          | 2021                                          |                                        2022 |                                        2021 |\n| Due within 1 year        |                             53 |                             64 |                    20 |                    21 | -                                             | 1                                             |                                          33 |                                          44 |\n| Due in 1 to 2 years      |                             45 |                             56 |                    18 |                    18 | -                                             | 1                                             |                                          27 |                                          39 |\n| Due in 2 to 3 years      |                             38 |                             47 |                    15 |                    15 | -                                             | 1                                             |                                          23 |                                          33 |\n| Due in 3 to 4 years      |                             32 |                             40 |                    14 |                    12 | 8                                             | 1                                             |                                          26 |                                          29 |\n| Due in 4 to 5 years      |                             28 |                             29 |                    12 |                    10 | -                                             | -                                             |                                          16 |                                          19 |\n| Due in more than 5 years |                            174 |                            134 |                    44 |                    37 | 11                                            | -                                             |                                         141 |                                          97 |\n| Total                    |                            370 |                            370 |                   123 |                   113 | 19                                            | 4                                             |                                         266 |                                         261 |\n\nThe following effects from activity as lessor are recognized for the period under review:\n\n## E.ON as Lessor - Effects within the Income Statement\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Finance-Lease                                |        |        |\n| Gain/loss from the disposal of  assets       | -      | -1     |\n| Financial income from net  investments       | 21     | 24     |\n| Income from  variable lease  payments        | 5      | 6      |\n| Operating-Lease                              |        |        |\n| Income from leasing                          | 59     | 50     |\n| thereof Income from variable  lease payments | 19     | 5      |\n\nResults from the disposal of assets were recognized in income.

The relationships with these entities do not generally differ from t hose that exist with municipal entities in which E.ON does not\n\nhave an interest. Expenses from transactions with related companies are generated mainly through electricity and gas deliveries as well as through management fees, IT services and third -party services.\n\nLiabilities of E.ON payable to related companies as of December 31, 202 2 , include \u20ac 55 million (202 1 : \u20ac62 million) in trade payables and shareholder loans to operators of jointly -owned nuclear power plants. These shareholder loans bear interest at 1.0 percent (202 1 : 1.0 percent) and have no fixed maturity. E.ON continues to have in place with these power plants a cost -transfer agreement and a cost plus -fee agreement for the procurement of electricity. The settlement of such liabilities occurs mainly through clearing accounts.\n\nUnder IAS 24, compensation paid to key management personnel (members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE) must be disclosed.\n\nThe total expense for 202 2 for members of the Management Board amounted to \u20ac11.8 million (202 1 : \u20ac11.3 million) in short -term benefits and \u20ac 0.3 million (202 1 : \u20ac1,9 million) in post -employment benefits. The cost of post -employment benefits is equal to the service cost of the provisions for pensions.\n\nThe expense determined in accordance with IFRS 2 for existing commitments arising from share -based payment in 202 2 was \u20ac2.7 million (202 1 : \u20ac9.2 million).\n\nProvisions for these commitments amounted to \u20ac1 0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: \u20ac15.6 million).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board received a total of \u20ac5.0 million for their activity in 2022 (2021: \u20ac5.1 million).\n\nEmployee representatives on the Supervisory Board were paid compensation under the existing employment contracts with subsidiaries totaling \u20ac1.0 million (2021: \u20ac0.8 million).",

To improve its meaningfulness as an indicator of the sustainable earnings power of the E.ON Group's business, unadjusted EBIT DA is adjusted for certain non-operating effects.\n\nOperating earnings also include income from investment subsidies for which liabilities are recognized.\n\nThe non -operating earnings effects for which EBIT DA is adjusted include, in particular, non -operating interest expense/income, income and expenses from the marking to market on the reporting date of un realized commodity derivatives and related provisions for contingent losses, where material, book gains/losses, certain restructuring expenses, impairment charges and reversals recognized in the context of impairment tests on noncurrent assets, on equity investments in affiliated or associated companies and on goodwill, and other contributions to non -operating earnings. IAS 29 is being applied for the first time in 2022 because of the hyperinflation in Turkey and the effects recognized in income are also presented in other non -operating earnings.\n\nIn addition, effects from the valuation of certain provisions on the balance sheet date are disclosed in non -operating earnings. In addition, effects that are to be initially recognized from the subsequent measurement of hidden reserves and charges in connection with the innogy purchase price allocation are included.\n\nNet book gains were higher compared with the previous year due to a pro rata disposal and the agreement between E.ON and igneo on the founding of a joint venture for the rollout of high -speed broadband infrastructure in Germany.\n\nRestructuring expenses were lower than in the 202 1 reporting period and, as in the previous year, mainly included expenses in connection with the restructuring of the UK distribution business.\n\nEffects in connection with derivative financial instruments changed by -\u20ac 6,373 million to -\u20ac3, 123 million. The change was primarily due to the realization of sales and procurement transactions that had been recognized in the previous year as derivatives with positive fair values, and to the decline in the fair values of unrealized sales and procurement transactions in line with price developments at the end of the year .\n\nOther non -operating earnings mainly include valuation effects for noncurrent provisions and the effects on earnings of the Turkish\n\ninvestments accounted for using the equity method in connection with the application of IAS 29. Measurement effects from foreign currency bonds also had a partially offsetting effect. The previous year was negatively impacted by measurement effects for repurchase obligations under IAS 32 and non -current provisions, as well as realized effects from hedging transactions for certain currency risks.\n\nIn addition to the non -operating earnings components of EBITDA described above, the following items are included in the earnings adjustments:\n\nIn 2022 , impairment losses were recognized in particular, in addition to the separately disclosed impairments in connection with the innogy purchase price allocation, in the areas of energy networks in Slovakia (mainly on goodwill in connection with the reporting as a disposal group). In the prior year, impairment losses were recognized in particular in the areas of energy networks in Romania and Customer Solutions in Slovakia .\n\nNonoperating interest income results from interest rate change effects from the l ongterm discounting of provisions at PreussenElektra. In addition, there is a positive effect from the difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective interest rate of the former innogy bonds adjusted due to the purchase price allocation.\n\nThe non -operating tax result includes high earnings which mainly result from the addition of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the measurement of pension obligations in the United Kingdom and commodity derivatives in Germany.\n\nOperating earnings attributable to non -controlling interests increased mainly as a result of higher operating earnings contributions from minority interests .",

In\n\nall material respects, this combined group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and ap propriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development .\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of th e consolidated financial statements and the combined group management report .\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; hereinafter the 'EU -AR'), taking into account the German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the German Institute of Public Auditors (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law and have fulfilled our other German professional obligations in compliance with these requirements. Furthermore, we declare in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) EU -AR t hat we have not provided any prohibited non -audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) EU -AR. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined group management report .\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are such matters that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 202 2 . These matters were taken into account in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n## Reco gnition and measurement of provisions for anticipated losses from sales -related gas and electricity supply contracts\n\nPlease refer to Section [1] and Section [26] in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied. Comments on the development of electricity and gas prices in the financial year can be found in the Business Report in the combined group management report .\n\n## RISK FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, E.ON SE accounted for provisions for anticipated losses totalling EUR 3.2 billion from executory sales contracts in the miscellaneous provisions in the consolidated financial statements. E.ON SE additionally reported market values of EUR 29.2 billion in the non -current and current (other) operating liabilities market values of EUR 26.3 billion in the operating liabilities that are accounted for at fair value in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments .\n\nA requirement for recognising provisions for onerous contracts is that there is a current external obligation in which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit is probable and which can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provisions is determined here based on the best estimate of the amount by which the unavoidable costs of fulfilling the contract will exceed the expected economic benefit of the contract, i.e. generally the agreed sales price in sales transactions.

Direct allocation of procurement transactions to individual sales obligations is generally not possible for electricity and gas supply companies and thus also not possible in the E.ON Group .\n\nThe recognition and measurement of the recognised provisions for anticipated losses from executory sales contracts - in due consideration of the various procurement transactions of the E.ON Group are consequently based on complex allocations and calcula tions for the sales portfolios of the E.ON Group as well as discretionary estimates by management, for example of anticipated contribution margins from the sales portfolios .\n\nThere is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that the provisions are not created or adequate provisions are not created .\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nAs a first step, we gained an understanding of the process at the E.ON Group for recognising the above -mentioned provisions for onerous contracts .\n\nWe subsequently assessed the design, implementation and effectiveness of controls that the E.ON Group has set up to ensure that the data for calculating the provisions for onerous contracts is collected in full. If IT processing systems were used in order to identify and collate the relevant data, we worked together with our IT specialists to test the effectiveness of the regulations and procedures that relate to a large number of IT applications and support the effectiveness of IT controls. We additionally assessed the design and implementation of controls that the E.ON Group has set up in order to ensure that appropriate assumptions are made .\n\nWe additionally assessed the appropriateness of the key data and assumptions as well as of the Company's calculation model. To this end, we verified the recognition and allocations of the procurement transactions and also discussed the expected development of margins and earnings in the various sales portfolios of the E.ON Group with the people responsible for the planning. We also carried out reconciliation with other forecasts that are available within the Group, e.g. the budget drawn up by the Board of Management and approved by the Supervisory Board and the medium -term planning. In addition, we assessed in sales markets of the E.ON Group selected on a risk -oriented basis the consistency of the assumptions relating to the sales volumes (and resulting unavoidable costs), e.g. in terms of possibilities for amending contracts, with the general regulatory conditions in these markets. In order to ensure that the valuation model used was mathematically accurate, we verified the Company's calculations on the basis of elements selected from a risk perspective .\n\n## OUR CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe calculations of the provisions for anticipated losses from executory sales transactions are appropriate. Overall, the assumptions made by management are reasonable .\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\nPlease refer to Section [1] in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied. Disclosures on the assumptions used as well as on the amount of the goodwill can be found in Section [15] of the notes to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## RISK FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe goodwill amounts to EUR 17. 0 billion as at 31 December 2022 and, at 78 % of the Group equity, constitutes a significant proportion of the assets .\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment once a year without this requiring a specific reason. If indications of impairment arise in the course of the year, an ad hoc impairment test is a dditionally carried out during the year. The goodwill is allocated to the cash -generating units or groups of cash -generating units, which essentially correspond to the operating segments at the E.ON Group. For the goodwill impairment test, the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount of the relevant cash -generating units or groups of cash -generating units. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss has to be recognised. At E.ON, the recoverable amount is initial ly calculated as the fair value less costs to sell .\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is complex and based on a number of discretionary assumptions. These include the expected business and earnings performance of the operating segments for generally the next three to five years, the long -term growth rates that are assumed and the discount rate that is applied .\n\nAs a result of the impairment tests that were carried out, the Company did not identify any need for impairment .\n\nThere is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that impairment existing as at the reporting date was not identified. There is also a risk that the related disclosures in the notes are not complete .\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nTo begin with, we gained an understanding of the process for assessing the recoverability of goodwill by getting explanations from staff of the finance organisation and by evaluating the Company's documentation. With the support of our valuation specialists, we assessed, among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions as well as of the Company's valuation model. To this end, we discussed and validated the expected business and earnings development as well as the assumed long -term growth rates with those responsible for the planning. We also carried out reconciliation with other forecasts that are",

In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the combined group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

This includes making steady progress toward our climate targets, effectively managing climate -related risks, seizing climate -related opportunities that fit with our corporate strategy, and reporting transparently on all these matters. To ensure that we do so, we have put in place a highly effective governance structure.\n\nThe TCFD's recommendations provide important guidance for reporting. Established in 2015, the TCFD aims to develop consistent, comparable, and accurate climate -related financial risk disclosures that companies can use to provide information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. E.ON became an official TCFD supporter in 2019, which marks the start of our TCFD reporting below. Going forward, we will continue to expand our TCFD reporting. One consequence of TCFD reporting is that we have developed a qualitative scenario analysis to assess how our businesses might be affected under different climate scenarios.\n\n\u203a In addition, the TCFD reporting is supported by additional information in the publication 'On course for net zero -Supporting paper for E.ON's decarbonization strategy and climate -related disclosures.' \u2039\n\n## Governance\n\nThe importance of climate change for E.ON is reflected in our governance. The Management Board has overall responsibility for the sustainability strategy, including the climate targets. It is informed on a quarterly basis by the Chief Sustainability Office r ('CSO') about important initiatives and developments as well as KPIs. The CSO manages and monitors all of the Company's sustainability activities and chairs the Sustainability Council. The council is E.ON's most important forum for discussing sustainability issues, establishing a sustainable mindset, and\n\nembedding it in business processes. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed about material sustainability topics by its Audit and Risk Committee, by its Innovation and Sustainability Committee, and by the Management Board. As part of the carbon management plan introduced in 2022, emission reduction paths were defined for the business units to implement the Group's climate targets at the local level. Our units conduct annual controls to ensure that we are on track to meet our targets.\n\n## Strategy\n\nE.ON's business operations cause carbon emissions. Yet our two core businesses -Energy Networks and Customer Solutions -also help millions of customers avoid emissions. They make the energy system more efficient and increase the proportion of renewables in the energy mix. E.ON's current climate strategy includes emission -reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050. In 2020 E.ON set new climate targets and intends to be climate -neutral by 2040 (Scope 1 and 2).\n\nBoth climate change and the energy transition aimed at slowing it could create risks as well as opportunities for E.ON's business. In 2022 we again performed a qualitative scenario analysis to model how the key value drivers of E.ON and five of our business units might be affected under different scenarios through 2050. The analysis consisted of three different climate scenarios: a conservative, ambitious, and fully committed climate policy. Subject experts analyzed the implications, which were used to conduct a risk -andopportunity assessment. It shows that we have a robust business model and great opportunities for decarbonization for every scenario. E.ON's high proportion of regulated business makes it robust, while massive electrification and decarbonization offer major opportunities for the Company's business model. In view of these important findings, we intend to review of the scenario analysis on an annual basis.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nE.ON regularly monitors and assesses its non -financial, climate, and other sustainability risks and opportunities and their potential impact in the short, medium, and long term. In 2020 we integrated climate -related risks into our Enterprise Risk Management system. In 2021 human rights risks in the supply chain, employee matters, social matters, and anti -corruption were integrated as well. Risk and sustainability managers at the units were actively involved in this process. The status of this process is presented to the E.ON Group Risk Committee on a regular basis. Our analyses of climat e risks encompass physical risks (such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes in consumer preferences, the regulatory environment, and carbon pricing ).\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nE.ON' s current climate metrics consist mainly of the emission figures for its carbon footprint categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3) and the measurement of progress toward its climate targets (see above). The climate targets defined in 2020 remain valid (see the Climate Protection chapter). We monitor progress toward these targets on an annual basis for all relevant GHG categories. The aforementioned carbon management plan apportions our emission -reduction targets to the business units, while giving them the operational decision -making authority on how to achieve them.\n\nIn addition, E.ON discloses avoided emissions. This applies to the annual reporting for its green b onds, which includes disclosures on the metric tons of CO 2 e avoided by the projects funded. A green b ond is a fixed -interest security whose issuance proceeds are used to fund infrastructure and energy -efficiency projects that yield measurable carbon savings. In 2022 E.ON issued three green bonds totaling \u20ac2.3 billion.",

Capital markets in particular want standardized ESG KPIs. Consequently, we have reported KPIs that give an indication on our ESG performance over three years.\n\nIn addition, since 2010 we've reported our KPIs in accordance with standards of the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (German abbreviation: 'DVFA') and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies ('EFFAS'). KPIs that reflect these standards are indicated by the DVFA/EFFAS ID. KPIs that are particularly important to us are highlighted.\n\nThe KPIs that were part of the independent Sustainability Assurance represent the different audit levels as follows:\n\n- Not part of the statutory audit, audited with reasonable assurance as part of the Sustainability Assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000.\n\nMore information about these figures (such as more detailed breakdowns) can be found in the corresponding chapters of this report.
