By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company cautions that its assumptions may not materialize and that current economic conditions render such assumptions, although reasonable at the time they were made, subject to greater uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'assumes,' 'outlook,' 'plans,' 'targets' or other similar words.\n\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of CN to be materially different from the outlook or any future results, performance or achievements implied by such statements. Accordingly, readers are advised not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that could affect the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions, including factors impacting global supply chains such as pandemics and geopolitical conflicts and tensions; industry competition; inflation, currency and interest rate fluctuations; changes in fuel prices; legislative and/or regulatory developments; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; actions by regulators; increases in maintenance and operating costs; security threats; reliance on technology and related cybersecurity risk; trade restrictions or other changes to international trade arrangements; transportation of hazardous materials; various events which could disrupt operations, including illegal blockades of rail networks; and natural events such as severe weather, droughts, fires, floods and earthquakes; climate change; labor negotiations and disruptions; environmental claims; uncertainties of investigations, proceedings or other types of claims and litigation; risks and liabilities arising from derailments; timing and completion of capital programs; and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed by CN with securities regulators in Canada and the U.S. Reference should be made to 'Management's Discussion and Analysis' in this annual report as well as the Annual Information Form and Form 40-F filed with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators and available on CN's website (www.cn.ca) for a description of major risk factors.\n\nForward-looking statements reflect information as of the date on which they are made. CN assumes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect future events, changes in circumstances, or changes in beliefs, unless required by applicable securities laws. In the event CN does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be made that CN will make additional updates with respect to that statement, related matters, or any other forward-looking statement.

I would like to thank our employees, shareholders and other stakeholders for welcoming me to the role and for their ongoing support and dialogue.\n\nFor CN, the past year has been transformative. Under the leadership of our new President and CEO, Tracy Robinson , CN renewed its disciplined approach to scheduled railroading, improving service to our customers and delivering strong operational and financial results. Our railroad is running well, and we are making significant progress toward building the railway and the supply chains of the future, together.\n\nAt CN, we understand our Company's purpose is to play an essential role in moving the North American economy and enabling global trade. Our tracks connect vibrant gateways on three coasts as well as busy terminals and yards in cities and towns everywhere in between. We work collaboratively with our customers to facilitate end-to-end supply chains and get the vital goods people and businesses need where and when they need them.\n\nBut CN's purpose is so much more. We know we must provide a safe and engaging work environment for our people, and we are making good progress in developing the next generation of railroaders. We are taking action to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment and help fight climate change. We are focused on supporting the communities in which we operate to help them become safer and stronger, including our Indigenous neighbours, by identifying and fostering economic and social opportunities. And, most important for our Board, we understand our responsibility to ensure leading governance practices as we work to create value and shared success for our shareholders and other stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples.\n\n## /d.smcp/e.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /s.smcp/o.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/d.smcp /f.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/c.smcp/i.smcp/a.smcp/l.smcp /p.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/f.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/m.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/c.smcp/e.smcp\n\nWith an experienced leadership team and the best railroaders in the business, CN once again delivered solid operating and financial performance in 2022, generating strong earnings per share and free cash flow. We delivered for our shareholders in 2022 by returning $4.7 billion through our share repurchase plan and by increasing the Company's quarterly dividend by 19%. For 2023, reflecting our prudent approach in the face of a softening economy, the Board was pleased to approve an 8% hike in the quarterly dividend, our 27th consecutive annual increase. This reflects our confidence in the strong cash flow generating capacity of CN through all business cycles.\n\nOn behalf of CN's Board of Directors, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Tracy, CN's entire leadership team and all our dedicated employees for their efforts and support throughout 2022.\n\n## /s.smcp/t.smcp/r.smcp /a.smcp/t.smcp/e.smcp/g.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp /o.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/s.smcp/i.smcp/g.smcp/h.smcp/t.smcp /a.smcp/n.smcp/d.smcp /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /i.smcp/m.smcp/p.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/c.smcp/e.smcp /o.smcp/f.smcp /e.smcp/s.smcp/g.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp /p.smcp/o.smcp/w.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /s.smcp/u.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/b.smcp/l.smcp/e.smcp /g.smcp/r.smcp/o.smcp/w.smcp/t.smcp/h.smcp\n\nWe are deeply dedicated to ensuring CN's strategic direction is aligned with our vision to sustainably power the North American economy. The Board purposefully focuses its agenda on a few critical areas: strategy and risk; monitoring and measuring the execution of the strategy, including assuring operational performance in support of our customers; and ensuring robust talent development and succession plans.\n\nAn important part of our strategic discussions is risk oversight. The business and risk environment have changed significantly in recent years and the Board's processes have responded accordingly, including scenario planning and dynamic deep dives in the areas of climate, cybersecurity, safety, geopolitics, and more.",

As one of Canada's largest companies, we are steadfast in our commitment to ensuring our ESG initiatives are in line with our responsibility to all stakeholders as we strive to modernize and lead in a constantly evolving landscape.\n\nIn accordance with our leading governance practices, we held an advisory vote of shareholders on CN's Climate Action Plan, which received an approval rating of 98.54% at the 2022 annual meeting. We are making good progress toward our 2030 science-based climate targets and to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nAnother pillar of ESG for CN is diversity, equity, inclusion and indigeneity. In 2021, our Board announced the creation of the CN Indigenous Advisory Council, an independent body comprised of Indigenous leaders from across Canada. We also made a commitment for half of the independent directors to represent diverse groups, including gender parity, by the end of 2022 - an objective we have achieved.\n\nCN is dedicated to fulfilling its role as a responsible corporate citizen in every aspect of what we do, from the field to the boardroom. We believe good governance is good business, and last year, CN joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative - a voluntary platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices.\n\n## /c.smcp/h.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp /t.smcp/o.smcp /y.smcp/o.smcp/u.smcp/r.smcp /b.smcp/o.smcp/a.smcp/r.smcp/d.smcp\n\nOver the past year, I have been pleased to work with our new Board members: David Freeman , Robert Knight , and Susan C. Jones . They bring deep expertise to their roles as well as a diversity of perspectives that enrich our Board discussions. In October 2022, we were very pleased to welcome Montreal-based Michel Letellier to our Board. As an independent director with extensive North American business experience and a record of sustainability leadership, Michel's diverse experience is a valuable asset to CN's Board.\n\nI am grateful for the diligent contributions of our directors over the past year, as they bring their unique viewpoints and expertise and work collaboratively with management to understand the changing risks and opportunities of our environment. We are committed to exercising foresight to \"see around corners\" through these strategic discussions at every meeting, informed by continuing director education and ongoing stakeholder and third-party perspectives.\n\nI would like to thank Board Chair Emeritus Robert Pace for his leadership over many years and wish him the best in his future endeavours. I would like to also thank Kevin Lynch , who retired last December, and Robert Phillips , who will retire in April, for their invaluable insight during their tenures, and lasting contributions to the Company.\n\nFinally, I would like to welcome our new Board nominee, Al Monaco , retired President and Chief Executive Officer of Enbridge Inc. Al brings to CN decades-long experience overseeing a large, complex, federally regulated and geographically diverse organization, including the management of capital-intensive operations, development of important linear infrastructure projects, deployment of operating technology, as well as international operations, sustainability and strategic planning.\n\nAs your Chair, and on behalf of every member of the CN Board of Directors, thank you once again for your trust, confidence, and continued support as we work together to power sustainable growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShauneen Bruder\n\nChair of the Board\n\n## /l.smcp/e.smcp/a.smcp/d.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /s.smcp/u.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/b.smcp/i.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/t.smcp /y.smcp /b.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp /p.smcp/r.smcp /a.smcp/c.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp\n\nIn 2022, we were proud to earn a spot for the seventh time on CDP's prestigious 'A List' for our leadership in corporate transparency and performance on tackling climate change. We have also been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for 11 straight years. CN took second place out of 226 companies listed on the S&P/TSX Composite Index in 2022 for corporate governance with a score of 98% in the Globe and Mail 's Report on Business' annual comprehensive ranking. We were also ranked one of the 'Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada' by Corporate Knights for the 14th consecutive year. And, CN was honoured to receive the 'Top 5% ESG Score' in the 2023 S&P Global Yearbook as one of the top sustainability performers in the transportation industry.",

I am proud of what our team has accomplished over the last year, and I am excited about what lies ahead. We take our role in supporting the growth of the North American economy seriously and we are focused on providing the right service, the right supply chain solutions and the right partnerships for our customers in their growth.\n\n## /b.smcp/a.smcp/c.smcp/k.smcp /t.smcp/o.smcp /b.smcp/a.smcp/s.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp/s.smcp\n\nWe are continuing our back-to-basics approach that drives the level of service our customers need and expect. Our scheduled operating plan provides consistent service to our customers, improves asset velocity and identifies available capacity. On-time operations drive predictability, efficiency and performance across our entire system and to our supply chain partners. Increasing the velocity of our operation creates the opportunity to move more goods and improves our capacity, reliability and financial performance. The entire CN team has leaned into this plan together, and we have delivered on our commitments over the last year, together. We are building trust and confidence between us and with our customers, shareholders, and the communities where we operate and where we live.\n\nCollaboration and integration are the keys to how we will move forward, together. We are breaking down silos and the team is energized about taking scheduled railroading to the next level and helping our customers succeed.\n\n## /p.smcp/o.smcp/w.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /n.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/t.smcp/h.smcp /a.smcp/m.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp /e.smcp/c.smcp/o.smcp/n.smcp/o.smcp/m.smcp/y.smcp\n\nWe have learned through the pandemic, and through the uncertainties that have followed, that the performance of global supply chains needs to improve to adjust to increasing demands for reliability and resilience. If we are to succeed in this new environment, we need to come together in a different way.\n\nIt is important to the proper functioning and growth of the economy that supply chains perform highly and have a better ability to respond to shocks. The customers we serve and the goods we deliver are vital to people across the continent and around the world. Changing trade flows are making optionality more important to our customers and supply chain partners. Building the ability to provide this capacity and flexibility requires a higher level of integration across all parts of the supply chain. We need to come together by sharing data, plans and performance to ensure we maximize the throughput of our supply chains, and we are nimble in responding to capacity needs.\n\nAt CN, we continue to invest in our network and our capabilities. We are working with our customers to understand their growth plans and the capacity requirements of our system and the broader supply chain. We are also leaning in to work more closely with our supply chain partners to build the performance and reliability that our customers need to succeed.\n\nThe supply chain performance essential to support the economic growth of the continent is available to us. We need to come together to realize how close it is. We have an opportunity to enable a robust future; one that powers growth and prosperity for national, regional and local economies.",

At the time of writing, we are completing our second consecutive year fatality free and we have worked over 600 days without a serious injury. We make this commitment each day.\n\nThe safe movement of all goods through the communities we serve across North America has never been more front-of-mind. We invest to reduce the likelihood of any incident. We invest in our infrastructure, our safety culture, our work processes and our operating protocols. We invest in powerful detection technology for track, roadbed and rolling stock with the aim to identify potential failures before they occur, and to ensure they are addressed proactively. We continue to work with industry and regulators to further best practices and to fully leverage the capabilities of technology and AI.\n\nWe work with our communities to ensure the capabilities to minimize the impact of any incident that takes place. Our team conducts regular training exercises internally and with local first responders to ensure the safe transport of all commodities, including hazardous materials. Our communities are important partners in planning and in\n\nresponse.

We care about communities. We care about how we work. We understand the importance of the work we do and our potential impact when we come together as an integrated and empowered team. Our employees are the family, friends and neighbours within communities - in good times and bad. When our neighbours are hurting, we step up to help them recover and rebuild.\n\nWe are focused on developing the next generation of supply chain talent. We are creating opportunities to experience more broadly and participate more directly. We want to harness the imaginations of our team around what is possible in the future and partner with them in building their ability to create it. There is both a great need to engage with the next generation and tremendous opportunity for them to grow and make a difference.\n\nCN has an exciting future. Our vision is to lead in the effort to create the next level of integrated supply chain performance and support the growth of the North American economy.

We are also focusing on strict adherence to Life Critical Rules , which address the day-to-day activities that have the potential to cause serious injury or even loss of life.\n\nCN has more than 80 joint union-management health and safety committees across the system that are helping to address the main causes of accidents and injuries and improve our safety culture.

Most recent technologies include autonomous track inspection railcars positioned in regularly scheduled trains. These are equipped with the latest sensors and AI technology, helping to improve the quantity and quality of our track inspections. With our fleet of 10 inspection cars running 24/7 and embedded in freight service without interrupting operations, we cover 100% of our mainline network, inspecting up to 20 times more track than with previous slow-moving methods. Other safety advancements include predictive analytics, digital processes, Electronic Track Authority Verification (see sidebar), a hazardous situations reporting app, and a walking simulator to train frontline employees how to avoid slips, trips and falls - the number one cause of injuries in the railway industry.\n\nOur 2022 safety results demonstrate good progress. CN's personal injury rate was down 19%, reaching its lowest level in the Company's history, evidence that our Safety Leadership Training , Looking Out for Each Other , and Life Critical Rules programs, among other initiatives, are having a positive effect. Innovative technologies are increasing the frequency and quality of track and railcar inspections and, combined with on-going infrastructure investments, are beginning to help reduce network accidents. CN's accident rate in Q4 2022 was down 13% compared to Q4 2021; however, the full year accident rate was up 7% compared to the previous year. This is evidence that we still have work to do, particularly during severe winter conditions as was the case in Q1 2022, on our journey to becoming the safest railroad in North America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /a.smcp/w.smcp/a.smcp/r.smcp/d.smcp-/w.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/n.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /t.smcp/e.smcp/c.smcp/h.smcp/n.smcp/o.smcp/l.smcp/o.smcp/g.smcp/y.smcp /h.smcp/e.smcp/l.smcp/p.smcp/s.smcp /k.smcp/e.smcp/e.smcp/p.smcp /f.smcp/i.smcp/e.smcp/l.smcp/d.smcp /t.smcp/r.smcp/a.smcp/c.smcp/k.smcp /e.smcp/m.smcp/p.smcp/l.smcp/o.smcp/y.smcp/e.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp /s.smcp/a.smcp/f.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn innovative real-time technology app developed by CN to keep field track employees safer has earned a 2022 Railway Association of Canada (RAC) Safety Award, our sixth RAC Safety Award in the past seven years. CN was recognized for its Electronic Track Authority Verification (ETAV) tool, which provides precise location information to Engineering hi-rail operators and warns them prior to exceeding their track authority limits.\n\nETAV complements existing processes that hi-rail operators use to get permission from rail traffic controllers to access and work on tracks. Operators log onto the ETAV application to see their precise location within their authorized track limits. Their truck's exact position is monitored in real-time through a global navigation satellite system. If they approach the limits of their track authority, ETAV sends them auditory and visual alerts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on CN's safety policies and initiatives, visit www.cn.ca/safety",

Since 2011, CN employees have initiated actions that have reduced energy consumption by 30% and avoided 171,000 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions at key yards and facilities, diverted 200,000 tonnes of operational waste from municipal landfills, and completed over 1,500 projects to improve housekeeping and create cleaner, more efficient and safer workplaces and communities.\n\nEcoConnexions has also been supporting the greening of communities and First Nations along our network in addition to mass reforestation projects. Together, we have been creating a living legacy of sustainability for current and future generations by supporting the value of trees. Since 2012, CN and our partners in Canada and the U.S. have planted over 2.3 million trees , making CN one of the leading private non-forestry tree planters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /f.smcp/u.smcp/t.smcp/u.smcp/r.smcp/e.smcp /i.smcp/s.smcp /e.smcp/l.smcp/e.smcp/c.smcp/t.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/f.smcp/y.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp\n\nWhen the Prince George Mechanical Car Shop needed to replace their 1988 propane forklift, the team decided to go electric. Using an electric forklift instead of propane removes 7.6 tonnes of CO2 from the environment each year and has kickstarted interest in electric forklifts across the network.\n\n'It was the way to go to support CN's sustainability efforts and contribute to the Company's goal of reducing carbon emissions.'

How we deliver success is just as important as what we achieve. Therefore, we work diligently to bring integrity and excellence into everything we do. As a Canadian reporting issuer with securities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), CN ensures its corporate governance practices comply with the highest standards and rules adopted by the Canadian Securities Administrators, applicable provisions of the U.S. Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CN is exempted from complying with many of the NYSE corporate governance rules, provided it complies with Canadian governance requirements. Except as summarized on our website at www.cn.ca/governance, CN's governance practices comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules in all significant respects.\n\nConsistent with the belief that ethical conduct goes beyond compliance and resides in a comprehensive governance culture, CN publishes and enforces its Corporate Governance Manual, Code of Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy. We also maintain several methods for employees and third parties to anonymously report accounting, auditing and other concerns.\n\nCN is proud of the leadership demonstrated by its Board of Directors with respect to diversity and is a proud signatory to the Catalyst Accord 2022. In 2021, the Board set a new target that at least 50% of the independent directors will come from diverse groups, including gender parity, by the end of 2022 - an objective we have achieved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN is in regular contact with Indigenous communities across our network, identifying and fostering business opportunities and promoting employment opportunities within these communities. In 2021, our Board announced the creation of the CN Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), an independent body comprised of Indigenous leaders from across Canada with a mandate to provide advice to CN's Board and CEO. CN is committed to building awareness and understanding of Indigenous culture at CN, increasing economic opportunities and partnerships to grow CN's Indigenous supply base, and establishing and strengthening our relationships to enhance our ability to attract Indigenous talent.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is aligned with international standards, including the United Nations Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the World Bank Mobility Goals, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. These expectations are integrated into our five sustainability pillars: Environment, Safety, People, Communities, and Governance.\n\nFor more information on CN's sustainability disclosures, visit: www.cn.ca/delivering-responsibly",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) dated January 31, 2023, relates to the consolidated financial position and results of operations of Canadian National Railway Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively \"CN\" or the \"Company,\" and should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. All financial information reflected herein is expressed in Canadian dollars and prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise noted.\n\nCN's common shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Additional information about CN filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company's 2022 Annual Information Form and Form 40-F, may be found online on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov through EDGAR, and on the Company's website at www.cn.ca in the Investors section. Printed copies of such documents may be obtained by contacting CN's Corporate Secretary's Office.\n\n## Business profile\n\nCN is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN's network of 18,600 route miles of track spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.), connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's extensive network and efficient connections to all Class I railroads provide CN customers access to Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Essential to the economy, to the customers, and to the communities it serves, CN safely transports more than 300 million tons of cargo, serving exporters, importers, retailers, farmers and manufacturers. CN and its affiliates have been contributing to community prosperity and sustainable trade since 1919. CN is committed to programs supporting social responsibility and environmental stewardship.\n\nCN's freight revenues are derived from seven commodity groups representing a diversified and balanced portfolio of goods transported between a wide range of origins and destinations. This product and geographic diversity better position the Company to face economic fluctuations and enhances its potential for growth opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CN's largest commodity group accounted for 29% of total revenues. From a geographic standpoint, 16% of revenues relate to U.S. domestic traffic, 32% transborder traffic, 18% Canadian domestic traffic and 34% overseas traffic. The Company is the originating carrier for over 85%, and the originating and terminating carrier for over 65%, of traffic moving along its network, which allows it both to capitalize on service advantages and build on opportunities to efficiently use assets.\n\n## Corporate organization\n\nThe Company manages its rail operations in Canada and the U.S. as one business segment. Financial information reported at this level, such as revenues, operating income and cash flow from operations, is used by the Company's corporate management in evaluating financial and operational performance and allocating resources across CN's network. The Company's strategic initiatives are developed and managed centrally by corporate management and are communicated to its regional activity centers (the Western Region, Eastern Region and U.S. Region), whose role is to manage the day-to-day service requirements of their respective territories, control direct costs incurred locally, and execute the strategy and operating plan established by corporate management.\n\nSee Note 24 - Segmented information to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's corporate organization, as well as selected financial information by geographic area.\n\n## Strategy overview\n\nCN has long been a nation builder and trade enabler, and is essential to the North American economy. The Company's strengths are many: a three-coast network; geographic, customer and product diversity; and a proven ability to innovate, including running a scheduled railroad.\n\nCN's business strategy is anchored on the Company's vision of Powering Sustainable Growth for our customers, our people and the communities in which we operate . CN's strategic plan is anchored on driving operational excellence every day, developing strong customer partnerships, growing geographic and product reach, and continuous innovation. CN's objective is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth by providing superior customer service, growing faster than the economy, pricing ahead of rail inflation, and continuously improving operating efficiency. This strategy rests on CN's strong commitment to Delivering Responsibly , moving its customers' goods safely and efficiently, doing so in a manner that seeks to minimize the impact on the environment, attracting and retaining top talent, helping build safer and stronger communities, and adhering to the highest governance standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nCN aims to drive consistent shareholder returns and earnings growth by striving for sustainable financial performance, including profitable top-line growth, strong free cash flow generation and return on invested capital well above the Company's cost of capital. CN also returns value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\n## Driving operational excellence every day\n\nCN's goal is to deliver reliable, efficient and cost-effective transportation services for its customers. CN continues to improve its service productivity and safety, with a focus on investments in network fluidity, automation, big data analytics and the digital customer experience. CN's scheduled railroading model focuses on improving every aspect of railroad operations to meet customer commitments efficiently and profitably. This calls for the continuous measurement of results and the use of such information to generate further improvements in the service provided to customers and in the efficiency of operations. By running a disciplined scheduled operation, with a focus on car velocity, CN can lean into its strengths and pursue growth opportunities across its three-coast network.\n\n## Developing strong customer partnerships\n\nCN aims to provide the best customer service by anticipating its customers' needs, understanding their growth plans, earning their trust, becoming a truly customer-centric organization and demonstrating agility. CN is developing deeper and stronger customer partnerships, putting its customers, and ultimately their end customers, at the center of its operations.\n\nCN's focus is on end-to-end collaboration to help our customers grow their markets. Supply chain collaboration agreements with ports, terminal operators and customers leverage key performance metrics that drive efficiencies within CN's operations and across the entire supply chain. CN's goal is to ensure a seamless end-to-end customer experience by bringing transparency to the supply chain and adjusting its service performance measures to better reflect its customers' changing requirements.\n\nCN is also leveraging technology in the way it does business, including sharing data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and improving its communications and service performance through the use of mobile reporting and enhanced digital customer interfaces.\n\n## Growing geographic and product reach\n\nWith its three-coast network that spans North America, CN is helping its customers in connecting North America to the world. To grow its reach for carload customers, CN is expanding its network of transload facilities across North America. In Western Canada, CN is investing in infrastructure and equipment to grow its capacity and increase its share of new industrial production while also responding to shifting demands in commodities. In Eastern Canada and the U.S., CN aims to further densify its network through gateway growth and providing customers with cost-advantageous intermodal routes.\n\n## Continuous innovation\n\nCN proactively pursues an ambitious innovation strategy using technology, analytics and automation to increase safety and efficiency as well as deliver a reliable, lower-carbon, seamless service to its customers. As a pioneer of scheduled railroading, CN is well positioned to drive the next wave of change by applying technology and new ways of working to unlock further operational excellence, customer service and employee engagement, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Leveraging a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to deliver new customer experiences and modernize CN's technology infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Using advanced digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics for better planning, efficiency, and safety.\n- \u00b7 Improving real-time data and analytical support tools.\n- \u00b7 More accurate, consistent and relevant information provided to all stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, communities).\n- \u00b7 Automating manual processes to improve efficiency and safety.\n- \u00b7 Protecting the Company's physical assets, digital assets and data to keep its network safe.\n- \u00b7 Collaborating on the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\n## Delivering Responsibly\n\nSustainability is at the heart of how CN is building for the future. Delivering Responsibly , the encapsulation of the Company's sustainability strategy and commitments, underpins all of CN's decisions, commitments and investments. The Company is focused on transporting goods safely and efficiently, doing so in a manner that seeks to minimize the impact on the environment, attracting, retaining and engaging top talent, helping to build stronger, safer communities, while adhering to the highest governance standards. CN understands that transparency is essential for stakeholder trust concerning the Company's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments. In that regard, CN seeks to align its ESG disclosures with global best practice frameworks, reporting on commitments and performance with focus, clarity and comparability. In 2022, CN announced that it joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative - a voluntary platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices. CN is also proud of its 2022 accomplishments, including being recognized\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\non CDP's prestigious \"A List' for the Company's efforts to tackle climate change, and for once again being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American indices.\n\n## Safety is a core value\n\nCN is intensely committed to the health and safety of its employees, the communities and environments in which it operates and the customers it serves. The Company embraces a safety culture based on the fundamental belief that all injuries and accidents are preventable. CN's primary objective is to reduce serious injuries and fatalities to zero. The Company is employing advanced technology and innovative training to help achieve this goal. More specifically, CN is:\n\n- \u00b7 Fostering an engaged workforce that understands and respects Life Critical Rules .\n- \u00b7 Embedding a mindset whereby employees take ownership for their own safety and the safety of others by Looking Out for Each Other .\n- \u00b7 Training employees to identify and mitigate exposures.\n- \u00b7 Using advanced technologies to proactively mitigate human error and reduce risk.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining reliable and safe equipment and infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Investing in employee training, coaching, recognition and engagement initiatives.\n\nSee the section entitled Human capital management -Health and safety of this MD&A for additional information regarding CN's safety initiatives.\n\n## Building the talent and culture to drive CN's continuous performance\n\nCN people have always been the Company's most important differentiator, caring passionately about railroading and bringing optimism, commitment and resilience to daily tasks. CN aims to attract, retain and train the very best talent, with a focus on a diverse, inclusive and winning culture to enhance employee engagement. The Company aspires to have workforce diversity that reflects the communities in which it operates. CN develops its employees with the necessary skills for an increasingly automated and data-driven work environment.\n\nSee the section entitled Human capital management of this MD&A for additional information regarding CN's human capital initiatives.\n\n## Tackling the impact of climate change\n\nThe Company's goal is to conduct its operations in a way that seeks to minimize environmental impact, while offering a carbon-efficient and sustainable way to move goods. CN is making a positive contribution in the fight against climate change and playing a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nWith approximately 85% of its direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from rail operations, CN believes the best way to reduce its carbon footprint is by continuously improving fuel efficiency. Over the years, this focus has resulted in significant progress in decoupling volume growth from carbon emissions intensity. CN continues to maintain its leadership position among Class I North American railways, consuming approximately 15% less locomotive fuel per gross ton mile than the industry average. CN was also the first North American railway, and among the first 100 companies globally, to announce an approved science-based climate target. CN aims to reduce GHG emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and in 2021, committed to setting a net-zero target by joining the \"Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C\" and the United Nations' \"Race to Zero\" campaign.\n\nTo achieve its decarbonization targets, CN will need to continue to improve the fuel efficiency of its fleets, increase its use of sustainable renewable fuels and test innovative propulsion technologies while working collaboratively to bring low-carbon alternatives to market. Collaboration with suppliers, customers, supply chain partners, innovators and regulators is critical for CN to deliver on its climate commitments and to help drive economic prosperity in a low-carbon environment.\n\nThe Company's CDP Report and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report are available on CN's website in the Delivering Responsibly section.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nCN does not operate in isolation. It is tightly integrated with the rest of society, providing vital links spanning eight provinces, 16 states, 110 First Nation and M\u00e9tis territories, and more than 2,000 towns and cities across its network. As such, CN continues to play an essential role and contributes to economic prosperity through job creation, investments and freight transportation services. However, CN believes it is not just what it does but how it does it that matters for its long-term success. The Company seeks to enhance its reputation through open and proactive engagement to ensure stakeholders and Indigenous communities are aware of its strategy. CN engages externally across a wide spectrum of initiatives and fosters effective two-way communications that ensure a respectful and beneficial exchange.\n\nCN believes the rail industry can enhance safety by working closely with communities. Under CN's structured Community Engagement program, the Company engages with municipal officers and their emergency responders to assist them in their emergency response planning. During this frequent outreach, CN discusses:\n\n- \u00b7 Its comprehensive safety programs and performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- \u00b7 The nature, volume and economic importance of dangerous goods it transports through their communities.\n- \u00b7 Emergency response planning.\n- \u00b7 Training sessions for emergency responders.\n\nThe outreach builds on CN's involvement in Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER \u00ae ), through which the Company has been working for many years to help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of transportation incidents. All Aboard for Safety is CN's flagship community education program. Every year, CN employees make hundreds of presentations and talk to thousands of children and adults at schools and community events in Canada and the U.S. about the importance of rail safety and the dangers of walking or playing on or near railway tracks.\n\nAs part of CN's year-round outreach effort, the CN Police Service continues to be active in communities across the CN network to promote safe behavior around railroad infrastructure. Activities include conducting enforcement initiatives with external agencies and delivering safety presentations to high-risk groups. During the industry's annual Rail Safety Week campaign, CN police officers and other employees, in partnership with Operation Lifesaver \u00ae , participate in numerous safety initiatives to raise awareness about preventing accidents and injuries around railway property.\n\nCN believes another way to help build more sustainable communities is to actively contribute millions of dollars each year through its CN Stronger Communities Fund to organizations, programs and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, innovation and safety, education, environmental protection, and many other causes such as food banks, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, healthcare centers, and anti-poverty organizations.\n\nCN is proud of its employees, retirees and their families who volunteer to make their communities better places to live, work and play. The CN Railroaders in the Community program recognizes these acts of kindness by providing grants to the community-based not-for-profit organizations employees (current, retired or family) choose to support through their volunteer efforts. CN also encourages employee community involvement through its annual volunteer CN In Your Community Day .\n\nOperating within or adjacent to the nearly 200 reserve lands of 110 First Nations and M\u00e9tis territories, CN is in regular contact with Indigenous communities across its network, identifying and fostering business opportunities, increasing employee awareness, and promoting employment opportunities within these communities. CN's Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), created in February 2021, is an independent body comprised of Indigenous leaders from across Canada. The IAC's mandate is to provide advice to CN's Board and to the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on relevant issues such as reinforcing diversity and inclusion through policies and procedures that reflect these principles.\n\n## Disciplined capital allocation and execution\n\nCN's success depends on a steady stream of capital investments that are aligned with and support its business strategy. These investments cover a wide range of areas, from track infrastructure and rolling stock to information and operating technologies, as well as other equipment and assets that improve the safety, efficiency, capacity and reliability of CN's service offering. Investments in track infrastructure enhance the safety and integrity of the physical plant, increase the capacity and fluidity of the network, promote service excellence, and support growth. New locomotives equipped with distributed power capability increase capacity, fuel productivity and efficiency, and improve service reliability, particularly in cold weather, while improving train handling and safety. Targeted railcar acquisitions aim to tap growth opportunities, complementing the fleet of privately owned railcars that traverse CN's network. CN is also investing in and deploying advanced technologies to automate labor-intensive tasks like track and railcar inspections, as well as to improve the customer experience through 'track and trace' functionality. CN's long-term economic viability depends on the presence of a supportive regulatory and government policy environment that encourages investment and innovation.\n\nThe multi-year implementation of CN's strategic plan requires a disciplined, analysis-driven approach to capital investment. Talent, technology and capital need to be fully aligned. The Company's capital investment roadmap includes several core elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in the maintenance of a safe and reliable network.\n- \u00b7 Investing in asset infrastructure to increase the capacity of its three-coast network.\n- \u00b7 Developing a portfolio approach to technology with business-led investment decisions, delivering value at each stage of implementation.\n- \u00b7 Deepening supply chain partnerships with its customers, including road-to-rail conversion.\n- \u00b7 Investing in data analytic systems, including AI, to support data-driven decision-making.\n- \u00b7 Investing in technologies and capital assets to support decarbonization of its footprint.\n- \u00b7 Growing its physical and commercial reach through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\n\n|",

The legislation implemented collective bargaining agreement terms for the four unions that had not previously ratified their agreements. These agreement terms are the same terms that previously were ratified and implemented by the other eight rail unions. All U.S. employees in the bargaining round are therefore now covered by new collective bargaining agreement terms based on the recommendations of the Presidential Emergency Board. The new terms increase wages by a compounded 24 percent over the five-year term of the contract, from 2020 through 2024, with a 14.1 percent wage increase effective immediately. The agreements also include five US$1,000 annual lump sum payments, adjustments to health care premiums, health benefit enhancements, and an additional personal leave day for all employees. This resulted in an incremental wage accrual of $47 million, or $35 million after-tax ($0.05 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter of 2022 in Labor and fringe benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Income, to reflect the terms of the new agreements.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nOn January 25, 2022, CN announced that Tracy Robinson was appointed as CN's President and CEO effective February 28, 2022. On November 28, 2022, the Company announced that Edmond (Ed) Harris assumed the role of Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, following the departure of Rob Reilly.\n\n## Reinvestment in the business\n\nIn 2022, CN spent approximately $2.75 billion in its capital program, of which $1.60 billion were invested to maintain the safety and integrity of its network, particularly track infrastructure. CN's capital spending also included $0.75 billion for strategic initiatives to increase capacity, enable growth and improve network resiliency, including line capacity upgrades and information technology initiatives, and $0.40 billion on equipment, including the acquisition of 500 new grain hopper cars.\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nThe Company repurchased 30.2 million of its common shares during the year, returning $4.7 billion to its shareholders. CN also increased its quarterly dividend per share by 19% to $0.7325 from $0.6150 in 2021, effective for the first quarter of 2022, and paid $2.0 billion in dividends in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

In addition, on that same day, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase of 8% to the quarterly dividend to common shareholders, from $0.7325 per share in 2022 to $0.7900 per share in 2023, effective for the first quarter.\n\n## Sustainability recognition\n\nThe Company's sustainability practices earned it a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices, for the 11 th and 14 th consecutive year, respectively. CN was also recognized for its actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low carbon economy, earning a spot on the CDP 'A' List for the seventh time, as well as being recognized for the 13 th time. CN was one of only three Canadian companies to earn a spot on the prestigious 'A' List in 2022.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated governments, institutions and communities to take actions that resulted in a partial economic shutdown beginning in March 2020. New variants of the virus led to the re-imposition of restrictive measures across North America and in other parts of the world in late 2021, however, in 2022, many North American jurisdictions relaxed or eliminated pandemic-related restrictions and mandates.\n\nThe long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of the impact on the business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity of the Company, remain unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the occurrence, scope and duration of any outbreaks as well as additional actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic.\n\n## 2023 Business outlook and assumptions\n\nThe Company assumes negative North American industrial production in 2023. For the 2022/2023 crop year, the grain crop in Canada was above its three-year average (or in line when excluding the significantly lower 2021/2022 crop year) and the U.S. grain crop was in line with its three-year average. The Company assumes that the 2023/2024 grain crops in Canada and the U.S. will be in line with their respective three-year averages (excluding the significantly lower 2021/2022 crop year in Canada).\n\nIn 2023, the Company will continue to invest in its capital program to improve the safety, efficiency and integrity of its network. These investments will enable and support the growth of the Company and will be financed with cash generated from operations or with cash from financing activities as required.\n\nThe forward-looking statements discussed in this section are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements and are based on certain factors and assumptions which the Company considers reasonable about events, developments, prospects and opportunities that may not materialize or that may be offset entirely or partially by other events and developments.

CN's Board and its committees, including the Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee and Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) provide oversight of the Company's human capital management strategies, programs, practices and performance. The HRCC is responsible for monitoring executive management's performance assessment, compensation and succession planning as well as ensuring effective talent management through engagement surveys and monitoring union relations and strategy for consistency with CN's strategic direction. The HRCC also has the mandate to review human resources practices and policies by ensuring, amongst other things, that appropriate human resources systems are in place so that the Company can attract, motivate and retain the quality and diversity of personnel required to meet its business objectives. The Company's senior management provides regular briefings on human capital matters to the Board and its Committees to facilitate oversight.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management are committed to maintaining and instilling a strong ethical culture at CN, and as such, have developed a solid ethics program based on CN's core values of integrity and respect. Each director, executive officer and management employee must certify annually their compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and employees are required to complete an online training course on the Code of Business Conduct. Integrity training is also part of every new employee's onboarding program. In addition, Anti-Fraud Policy and Guidelines apply to all employees of CN and its wholly owned subsidiaries and set out steps to be taken in response to reported or suspected fraud in all its forms, as well as measures that are taken to identify, prevent and manage fraud-related risks.\n\n## Total employees\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, CN employed a total of 17,392 employees in Canada (2021 - 16,314), of which 12,841, or 74%, were unionized employees (2021 - 11,878, or 73%) and 6,579 employees in the U.S. (2021 - 6,290) of which 5,571, or 85%, were unionized employees (2021 5,289, or 84%). Within Canada, there are 79 bargaining units and in the U.S., there are currently 43 active bargaining units. See the section entitled Business risks of this MD&A for additional information regarding labor negotiations.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nCN has an uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of its employees, the customers it serves, and the communities and environments in which it operates. The Company's long-term safety improvement is driven by continued investments in infrastructure, rigorous safety processes and exposure reduction efforts, as well as efforts to continue deepening the Company's safety culture. The attainment of annual accident and injury targets is a component of management's annual incentive bonus plan. The Company's injury frequency rate and accident rate, defined according to the criteria of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), are provided for the entire company's operations and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis. See the section entitled Selected railroad statistics for additional information on CN's safety measures.\n\nCN's culture and commitment to safety is supported by its focus on training, leadership, and technology. CN's Safety Management System is the framework for putting safety at the center of its day-to-day operations. This proactive plan is designed to minimize risk, drive continuous improvement in the reduction of injuries and accidents, and engage employees at all levels of the organization.\n\nThe Looking Out For Each Other peer-to-peer engagement program focuses on raising awareness among all employees of the top causes of incidents and injuries, identifying and reviewing safe work procedures, training employees to be aware of their surroundings and recognize potential at-risk work practices, teaching employees how to provide constructive feedback to their peers and learning from past incidents. The Company's Life Critical Rules address the day-to-day activities that have the potential to cause serious harm or even loss of life. They are based on past incidents and are designed to help ensure they do not happen again. CN's safety leadership training program is heavily focused on teaching employees the importance of controlling exposures to risk and on developing the attitudes and behaviors required for a values-driven safety culture.\n\nCN also continues to leverage new technology to drive improved safety performance including installing powerful sensor and AI technology into specially equipped autonomous track inspection cars positioned in existing train service, enabling track inspections at normal track speed. AI technology is also enhancing how CN inspects its railcar fleet. Automated inspection portals feature ultra-high-definition cameras that capture a 360\u00b0 view of a train as it travels through at track speed. Both these innovations in automation increase inspection frequency and quality and play an important role in preventing incidents. CN has also implemented Electronic Track Authority Verification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Triennially, CN undergoes a Responsible Care\u00ae audit conducted by an external audit team to ensure CN's processes, programs and policies meet the rigorous Responsible Care\u00ae Management System Specifications, Guiding Principles and Stewardship Codes.\n\nCN works closely with all of its customers and suppliers to ensure adherence to Life Critical Rules where applicable, and to encourage a shared commitment to a values-based safety culture.\n\nCN believes that the rail industry can also enhance safety by working more closely with communities. Under CN's structured Community Engagement program, the Company engages with municipal officers and their emergency responders in an effort to assist them in their emergency response planning. The outreach builds on CN's involvement in the TRANSCAER \u00ae initiative, through which the Company has been working for many years to help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of transportation incidents.\n\n## Pandemic Plan\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CN deployed its multi-phase Pandemic Plan in March of 2020 and continues to institute various measures to protect its employees, customers, and the communities in which CN operates:\n\n- \u00b7 CN's medical team and occupational health department, who are members of the Association of American Railroads Health Committee, have played a pivotal role in CN's pandemic planning, taking direction from the World Health Organization, as well as federal, provincial and state authorities, as required, and offering best practices shared amongst North American railroads.\n- \u00b7 CN implemented preventative measures to ensure the safety of its employees and by extension, of its customers and communities. As Public Health authorities have relaxed their recommendations, CN has evolved accordingly.\n- \u00b7 Between January and June 2022, CN complied with Transport Canada's Ministerial Order mandating COVID vaccination. In June 2022, the government of Canada repealed the mandatory COVID vaccination. CN therefore invited back to work employees who had been put on leave of absence per the Ministerial Order. CN continues to follow all public health recommendations across our network and adjusts as these recommendations evolve.\n- \u00b7 Aligned with public health, office-based employees who were able to work from home during the height of the pandemic have been invited back to the office and are now working from the office in a hybrid model where possible. Safety measures are in place and remain aligned with relevant public health authorities' recommendations for all employees, office and field alike.\n- \u00b7 Through a dedicated COVID team which includes nurses, CN continues to monitor COVID cases as well as answer any employees questions or concerns.\n- \u00b7 CN communicates any relevant updates on the status of the pandemic as it relates to our operations.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Attraction and recruitment\n\nCN continues to align its talent strategies to the business objectives, by focusing on acquiring as well as developing the various skills and capabilities required to meet its commitments, address challenges, and ensure a solid bench of talent to mitigate risk. CN recruits and hires talent with a broad range of strengths, perspectives and experiences, while also engaging with partners across our network, including Indigenous and other equity-seeking groups to ensure CN has the representation of populations across our communities. Over the last year, similar to other organizations, CN has had to compete extensively to attract talent, however its refreshed early career strategy, which allows it to partner with university and technical schools across Canada and the U.S., has helped create strong visibility of our jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, CN was recognized as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers and Montreal's Top Employers. In addition, CN was also listed as one of Canada's best Diversity Employers.\n\n## Training and development\n\nCN offers a variety of training programs, which cover mandatory requirements or are part of an employee's learning journey and development. This ensures that its employees are equipped to perform in their roles and prepare for career advancement opportunities, as required.\n\nThe Company offers trainings in technical, business and leadership programs, with either online, e-learning or virtually-led courses, and, when possible or necessary, through in-person sessions. People leaders are supported in building the skills and knowledge needed to successfully perform at each level and this includes a focus on enhancing communication skills, increasing collaboration across teams and creating a strong base of inclusive leadership throughout our workforce. In 2022, CN also launched its online and curated playlists/curricula for more self-guided and self-paced learning to allow for development tools to be available throughout the year and self-directed by the employee. For the Operations group, CN has various entry-level supervisory programs, to onboard front-line management, that focus on providing those\n\n|",

The programs last between six to twelve months, with both classroom learning and practical application in the field before they are ready for appointment into front line positions.\n\nFurthermore, CN also supports its employees through a structured performance management process. At the beginning of each year, nonunionized employees set goals for the year that align to its business strategy and objectives. At mid and year-end, there is a formal discussion and review of progress against these goals as well as how they were achieved. CN continues to emphasize the importance of a performancebased culture. In addition, there are also development discussions with key talent to enhance skills, capabilities and experience across the talent pools.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCN's approach to compensation continues to be driven by our goal to deliver sustainable value creation, while ensuring that target compensation supports the attraction and retention of talent. Compensation programs are designed to encourage appropriate behaviors and include appropriate risk mitigation mechanisms. In addition, compensation best practices adopted by CN include industry benchmarking and pay positioning as well as pay equity reviews.\n\nCN offers a competitive compensation portfolio that consists of base salary, employee share investment plan, short-term and long-term incentives (applicable to certain employees only), benefits, retirement plans and other non-monetary elements.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nAt CN, employees are the Company's single greatest asset and the importance of creating a work environment that welcomes the contribution and uniqueness of every employee is recognized. CN is committed to creating a workforce of top talent that reflects the diversity of the population and stakeholders it serves. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan (\"Diversity Plan\") focuses on developing a more inclusive workplace by increasing the representation of women, people of color, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and veterans. The plan applies at all levels within the organization and includes strategies on sourcing (among others, early career sourcing through internships, co-op and new graduate programs), selection, hiring, training and development of diverse candidates, anchoring CN's commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\nThe Company has embedded diversity in its policy regarding composition of the Board and executive management. The Diversity Policy, which also applies to executive management, states that in fulfilling its oversight role, the HRCC regularly reviews CN's integrated approach to executive and high-potential talent management and succession planning, in order to ensure that CN has diverse candidate pools for potential successors for executive roles.\n\nCN is undertaking various initiatives aimed at better promoting and reinforcing diversity, equity and inclusion which are strongly supported through active involvement by management and the Board. Some examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 executing on a renewed DE&I vision whereby CN aims to reflect the communities in which it operates;\n- \u00b7 conducting regular reviews of pay equity and defining a roadmap to address identified gaps;\n- \u00b7 refocusing our sponsorships and donations budget to better align with our strategic DE&I vision;\n- \u00b7 assessing hiring practices to leverage diversity focused recruitment agencies and requiring diverse candidate slates for all recruitment mandates;\n- \u00b7 developing inclusive leaders through targeted training and education, including unconscious bias and inclusive leadership training, as leaders will be critical in creating and sustaining an inclusive environment;\n- \u00b7 continuing to support and leverage the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that are backed by executive sponsors (currently seven ERGs); and\n- \u00b7 having sufficient resources to support our DE&I vision.\n\nCN had set a target that by the end of 2022 it would achieve and thereafter maintain a Board composition in which at least 50% of the independent Board members are to come from diverse groups, including gender parity. Currently, five out of 10, or 50% of independent Board members are women and two, or 20% of independent Board members are from underrepresented groups. CN had also elected to set a gender diversity target for executive management (comprising all Vice-Presidents and more senior positions), whereby at the end of 2022, at least 30% of this group would be women. This aligns to the targets as set out in the Catalyst Accord 2022, to which CN is a signatory. CN made significant progress with respect to the representation of executive women, increasing from 18% at the end of 2021, to attaining the 30% target in early December 2022. Currently 27%, or eight of the 30 executive management roles, are held by women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The 2022 actual results were in line with the Company's last 2022 outlook that was updated on October 25, 2022.\n\nCapital expenditures for the year were $2.75 billion, approximately 16% of revenues, compared to 17% of revenues per the Company's 2022 outlook, mainly due to higher revenues as a result of higher fuel surcharge revenue and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n|",

The increase of $2,630 million, or 18%, was mainly attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports and higher volumes of U.S. grain; partly offset by lower international container traffic volumes via the port of Vancouver as a result of supply chain congestion and significantly lower export volumes of Canadian grain in the first half of 2022.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $10,267 million compared to $8,861 million in 2021. The increase of $1,406 million, or 16%, was mainly as a result of higher fuel prices, the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar as well the Recovery of the loss on assets held for sale of $137 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from the Company entering into an agreement for the sale of non-core lines; partly offset by Transaction-related costs of $84 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $1,224 million, or 22%, to $6,840 million, when compared to the same period in 2021. The operating ratio was 60.0% in 2022, compared to 61.2% in 2021, a 1.2-point improvement.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $5,118 million, an increase of $219 million, or 4%, when compared to 2021, and diluted earnings per share increased by 8% to $7.44. (1) The increase was mainly driven by higher operating income in 2022, partly offset by a merger termination fee of $886 million ($770 million after-tax) received from KCS in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

In addition, the Company's fuel initiatives allowed it to achieve a new record for fuel efficiency of 0.867.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to 2020, operating performance improved across most measures, specifically through network train speed, through dwell and car velocity, despite negative impacts from the polar vortex in February, the forest fires in Western Canada over the summer and the B.C. washouts in the fourth quarter. The Company capitalized on its prior year's strategic investments in its infrastructure and its continued focus on efficiency and network fluidity. In addition, the Company's fuel initiatives allowed it to achieve a record fuel efficiency of 0.884.\n\n|",

From management's perspective, these non-GAAP measures are useful measures of performance and provide investors with supplementary information to assess the Company's results of operations and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nFor further details of these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, refer to the sections of this MD&A entitled Adjusted performance measures, Constant currency, ROIC and adjusted ROIC, and Liquidity and capital resources .\n\n## Adjusted performance measures\n\nAdjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating ratio are non-GAAP measures that are used to set performance goals and to measure CN's performance. Management believes that these adjusted performance measures provide additional insight to management and investors into the Company's operations and underlying business trends as well as facilitate period-to-period comparisons, as they exclude certain significant items that are not reflective of CN's underlying business operations and could distort the analysis of trends in business performance. These items may include:\n\n- i. operating expense adjustments: workforce reduction program, depreciation expense on the deployment of replacement system, advisory fees related to shareholder matters, losses and recoveries from assets held for sale, business acquisition-related costs;\n- ii. non-operating expense adjustments: business acquisition-related financing fees, merger termination income, gains and losses on disposal of property; and\n- iii. the effect of tax law changes and rate enactments.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's adjusted net income was $5,134 million, or $7.46 per diluted share, which excludes advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $22 million, or $16 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) recorded in Casualty and other within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported adjusted net income of $4,225 million, or $5.95 per diluted share, which excludes: (1)\n\n- \u00b7 employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program of $39 million, or $29 million after-tax ($0.04 per diluted share) recorded in the third quarter in Labor and fringe benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $20 million, or $15 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) of which $13 million, or $10 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter and $7 million, or $5 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the third quarter in Casualty and other within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 the recovery of $137 million, or $102 million after-tax ($0.14 per diluted share) recorded in the first quarter related to the loss on assets held for sale in the second quarter of 2020, to reflect an agreement for the sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core rail lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario to a short line operator;\n- \u00b7 transaction-related costs, consisting of an advance to Kansas City Southern (KCS) and a related refund, net of transaction costs, of $84 million, or $70 million after-tax ($0.10 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS;\n- \u00b7 amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million, or $84 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted share), of which $65 million, or $60 million after-tax ($0.08 per diluted share) was recorded in the third quarter and $32 million, or $24 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) was recorded in the second quarter, resulting from the KCS transaction, recorded in Interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income; and\n- \u00b7 merger termination fee paid by KCS to CN of $886 million, or $770 million after-tax ($1.08 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from KCS' notice of termination of the CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported adjusted net income of $3,767 million, or $5.28 per diluted share (1) , which excludes a loss of $486 million, or $363 million after-tax ($0.51 per diluted share) in the second quarter, resulting from the Company's decision to market for sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, and a current income tax recovery of $141 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in the first quarter resulting from the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company calculates ROIC as return divided by average invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Return is defined as Net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's effective tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of Total shareholders' equity, Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt less Cash and cash equivalents, and Restricted cash and cash equivalents, averaged between the beginning and ending balance over the last twelve-month period. The Company calculates adjusted ROIC as adjusted return divided by average invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted return is defined as adjusted net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's adjusted effective tax rate. Return, average invested capital, ROIC, adjusted return and adjusted ROIC do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income and adjusted net income to return and adjusted return, respectively, as well as the calculation of average invested capital, which have been used to calculate ROIC and adjusted ROIC:\n\n| In millions, except percentage                                                         | As at and for the year ended December 31,   | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net income  (1)                                                                        | $                                           | 5,118     | $  4,899  | $  3,545  |\n| Interest expense                                                                       |                                             | 548       | 610       | 554       |\n| Tax on interest expense  (2)                                                           |                                             | (133)     | (139)     | (120)     |\n| Return  (1)                                                                            |                                             | $  5,533  | $  5,370  | $  3,979  |\n| Average total shareholders' equity                                                     |                                             | $  22,064 | $  21,198 | $  18,846 |\n| Average long-term debt                                                                 |                                             | 13,175    | 11,987    | 11,931    |\n| Average current portion of long-term debt                                              |                                             | 783       | 709       | 1,420     |\n| Less:  Average cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents |                                             | (1,088)   | (1,221)   | (844)     |\n| Average invested capital                                                               |                                             | $  34,934 | $  32,673 | $  31,353 |\n| ROIC  (1)                                                                              |                                             | 15.8%     | 16.4%     | 12.7%     |\n| Adjusted net income  (1)(3)                                                            |                                             | $  5,134  | $  4,225  | $  3,767  |\n| Interest expense                                                                       |                                             | 548       | 610       | 554       |\n| Less:  Amortization of bridge financing and other fees  (4)                            |                                             | -         | (97)      | -         |\n| Tax on interest expense less amortization of bridge financing and other fees           | (5)                                         | (133)   - | (123)     | (137)     |\n| Adjusted return  (1)                                                                   | $                                           | 5,549     | $  4,615  | $  4,184  |\n| Average invested capital                                                               |                                             | $  34,934 | $  32,673 | $  31,353 |\n| Adjusted ROIC  (1)                                                                     |                                             | 15.9%     | 14.1%     | 13.3%     |\n\n|",

On a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been lower by $90 million ($0.13 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n| In millions, except per share data                   | Year ended December 31,   | 2022     | Constant  currency impact   | 2021    | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                             |                           |          |                             |         |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                              |                           | $  3,229 | $  (74)  $                  | 2,816   | 12%                                            |\n| Metals and minerals                                  |                           | 1,911    | (57)                        | 1,548   | 20%                                            |\n| Forest products                                      |                           | 2,006    | (57)                        | 1,740   | 12%                                            |\n| Coal                                                 |                           | 937      | (11)                        | 618     | 50%                                            |\n| Grain and fertilizers                                |                           | 2,783    | (56)                        | 2,475   | 10%                                            |\n| Intermodal                                           |                           | 4,906    | (58)                        | 4,115   | 18%                                            |\n| Automotive                                           |                           | 797      | (24)                        | 576     | 34%                                            |\n| Total freight revenues                               |                           | 16,569   | (337)                       | 13,888  | 17%                                            |\n| Other revenues                                       |                           | 538      | (15)                        | 589     | (11%)                                          |\n| Total revenues                                       |                           | 17,107   | (352)                       | 14,477  | 16%                                            |\n| Operating expenses                                   |                           |          |                             |         |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                            |                           | 2,935    | (43)                        | 2,879   | -%                                             |\n| Purchased services and material                      |                           | 2,191    | (33)                        | 2,082   | (4%)                                           |\n| Fuel                                                 |                           | 2,518    | (88)                        | 1,513   | (61%)                                          |\n| Depreciation and amortization                        |                           | 1,729    | (25)                        | 1,598   | (7%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                      |                           | 338      | (10)                        | 336     | 2%                                             |\n| Casualty and other                                   |                           | 556      | (15)                        | 506     | (7%)                                           |\n| Recovery of loss on assets held for sale             |                           | -

The increase of $2,630 million, or 18%, was mainly attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports and higher volumes of U.S. grain; partly offset by lower international container traffic volumes via the port of Vancouver as a result of supply chain congestion and significantly lower export volumes of Canadian grain in the first half of 2022.\n\nFuel surcharge revenues increased by $1,592 million in 2022, mainly as a result of higher fuel prices.\n\nIn 2022, RTMs, measuring the weight and distance of freight transported by the Company, increased by 1% relative to 2021. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 18% in 2022 when compared to 2021, mainly driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, a decrease in the average length of haul and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Petroleum and chemicals\n\n| Year ended December 31,   | 2022     | 2021     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)      | $  3,229 | $  2,816 | 15%        | 12%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)          | 46,273   | 42,436   | 9%         | 9%                              |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)      | 6.98     | 6.64     | 5%         | 3%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands)     | 636      | 596      | 7%         | 7%                              |\n\nThe petroleum and chemicals commodity group comprises a wide range of commodities, including chemicals and plastics, refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids, crude oil and sulfur. The primary markets for these commodities are within North America, and as such, the performance of this commodity group is closely correlated with the North American economy as well as oil and gas production.

Production of grain varies considerably from year to year, affected primarily by weather conditions, seeded and harvested acreage, the mix of grains produced and crop yields. Grain exports are sensitive to the size and quality of the crop produced, international market conditions and foreign government policy. The majority of grain produced in Western Canada and moved by CN is exported via the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Thunder Bay. These rail movements are subject to government regulation that establishes a maximum revenue entitlement that railways can earn. Although railway companies are free to set freight rates for western grain shipments, total revenue is limited based on a formula that takes into account tonnage, length of haul, and a specified price index. Shipments of grain that are exported to the U.S. are not regulated. Grain grown in the U.S. Midwest is exported as well as transported to domestic processing facilities and feed markets. The Company also serves major producers of potash in Canada, as well as producers of ammonium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia, urea and other fertilizers across Canada and the U.S. The key drivers for fertilizers are input prices, demand, government policies, and international competition.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues for this commodity group increased by $308 million, or 12%, when compared to 2021, mainly due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, freight rate increases and increased volumes of U.S. grain and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by significantly lower export volumes of Canadian grain in the first half of 2022 compared to record volumes in the prior year and reduced potash shipments.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 19% in 2022 when compared to 2021, mainly due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, freight rate increases, a decrease in the average length of haul and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Canadian grain - regulated               | 32 %   | 39 %   |\n| U.S. grain - domestic                    | 22 %   | 19 %   |\n| Canadian grain - commercial              | 13 %   | 12 %   |\n| Fertilizers - potash                     | 13 %   | 14 %   |\n| U.S. grain - exports                     | 11 %   | 7 %    |\n| Fertilizers - other                      | 9 %    | 9 %    |\n\n## Intermodal\n\n|                       | 2022     | 2021     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  4,906 | $  4,115 | 19%        | 18%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 56,029   | 58,412   | (4%)       | (4%)                            |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 8.76     | 7.04     | 24%        | 23%                             |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 2,450    | 2,611    | (6%)       | (6%)                            |\n\nThe intermodal commodity group includes rail and trucking services and is comprised of two markets: domestic intermodal and international intermodal. Domestic intermodal transports consumer products and manufactured goods, serving retail, wholesale and logistics provider channels, within domestic Canada, domestic U.S., Mexico and transborder, while international intermodal handles import and export container traffic, serving the major ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert, Montreal, Halifax, New Orleans and Mobile. CN's network of inland intermodal terminals, located near ports and large urban centers, connects customers to major markets in North America and overseas. Domestic intermodal is driven by consumer markets, with growth generally tied to the economy. International intermodal is driven by North American economic and trade conditions as well as global trade patterns.

Certain incentive compensation plans are based mainly on financial performance targets and the related expense is recorded in relation to the attainment of such targets.\n\nLabor and fringe benefits expense increased by $56 million, or 2%, in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to general wage increases, an incremental wage accrual for the tentative agreements with the U.S. unions and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by lower average headcount, lower pension expense and employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n## Purchased services and material\n\nPurchased services and material expense includes the cost of services purchased from outside contractors; materials used in the maintenance of the Company's track, facilities and equipment; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; utility costs; and the net costs of operating facilities jointly used by the Company and other railroads.\n\nPurchased services and material expense increased by $109 million, or 5%, in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher material costs, the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and higher snow clearing and utility costs driven by harsher winter operating conditions; partly offset by lower international freight forwarding expense as a result of closing down CN Worldwide.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense includes fuel consumed by assets, including locomotives, vessels, vehicles and other equipment as well as federal, provincial and state fuel taxes.\n\nFuel expense increased by $1,005 million, or 66%, in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly as a result of higher fuel prices and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes the costs associated with the use of properties and intangible assets over their estimated service lives. Depreciation expense is affected by capital additions, railroad property retirements from disposal, sale and/or abandonment and other adjustments including asset impairments.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $131 million, or 8%, in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to a higher depreciable asset base and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Equipment rents\n\nEquipment rents expense includes rental expense for the use of freight cars owned by other railroads (car hire) or private companies and for the lease of freight cars, locomotives and intermodal equipment, net of rental income from other railroads for the use of the Company's freight cars (car hire) and locomotives.\n\nEquipment rents expense increased by $2 million, or 1%, in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher locomotive horsepower-hour income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Casualty and other\n\nCasualty and other expense includes expenses for personal injuries, environmental, freight and property damage, insurance, bad debt, operating taxes, cloud computing, software and support costs, advisory fees related to shareholder matters as well as travel expenses.\n\nCasualty and other expense increased by $50 million, or 10% in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher cloud computing costs, travel costs and operating taxes as well as the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher passenger train recoveries.\n\n## Recovery of loss on assets held for sale\n\nRecovery of loss on assets held for sale of $137 million in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from the Company entering into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario representing 850 miles that were classified as assets held for sale plus an additional 50 miles of track and roadway assets. See Note 6 - Assets held for sale to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Transaction-related costs\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred transaction costs related to the terminated CN Merger Agreement of $84 million, consisting of $125 million of transaction-related costs; US$700 million ($845 million) paid to KCS and reported as an advance to KCS in the second quarter and expensed in the third quarter; and the related refund received of US$700 million ($886 million) in the third quarter. See Note 4 - Acquisition to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income and expenses\n\n## Interest expense\n\nIn 2022, Interest expense was $548 million compared to $610 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million recorded in 2021 (see Note 4 - Acquisition to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information ) ; partly offset by a higher average level of debt and a negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2022, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $498 million compared to $407 million in 2021. (1) The increase was mainly due to lower amortization of net actuarial loss and higher expected return on assets; partly offset by higher interest cost.\n\n## Merger termination fee\n\nIn 2021, the Company received a US$700 million ($886 million) termination fee resulting from KCS terminating the CN Merger Agreement and entering into a merger agreement with CP. See Note 4 - Acquisition to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income (loss)\n\nIn 2022, Other loss was $27 million compared to Other income of $43 million in 2021. The unfavorable variance was mainly due to fluctuations in the fair value of an equity investment in autonomous driving technology.\n\n## Income tax expense (1)\n\nIn 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,645 million compared to an income tax expense of $1,443 million in 2021.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2022 was 24.3% compared to 22.8% in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the merger termination fee, transaction-related costs, and bridge financing and other fees resulting from the KCS transaction recorded in the 2021 Consolidated Statements of Income, taxed at a lower inclusion rate.\n\nFor 2023, the Company anticipates the estimated annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 25.0%.\n\n- (1) See Note 2 - Change in accounting policy to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n|",

The increase of $658 million, or 5%, was mainly attributable to freight rate increases, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and an increase in intermodal ancillary services; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of Canadian grain in terms of RTMs compared to record volumes in 2020.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,861 million compared to $9,042 million in 2020. The decrease of $181 million, or 2%, was mainly due to the $137 million recovery recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to the $486 million loss on assets held for sale recorded in the second quarter of 2020, as well as the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher fuel costs due to rising fuel prices, higher incentive compensation and $84 million of transaction-related costs resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $839 million, or 18%, to $5,616 million, an all-time record. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5,622 million, an increase of $359 million, or 7%, when compared to 2020. (1)\n\nThe operating ratio was 61.2% in 2021, compared to 65.4% in 2020, a 4.2-point improvement. The adjusted operating ratio was 61.2% in 2021 compared to 61.9% in 2020, a 0.7-point improvement. (1)\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,899 million, an increase of $1,354 million, or 38%, when compared to 2020, and diluted earnings per share increased by 39% to $6.90. (2) The increase was mainly driven by a merger termination fee of $886 million ($770 million after-tax) received from KCS. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,225 million, an increase of $458 million, or 12%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 13% to $5.95, when compared to 2020. (1)(2)\n\nThe Company generated record free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3,296 million compared to $3,227 million in 2020, an increase of $69 million, or 2%. (1)\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, CN entered into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario representing 850 miles that were classified as assets held for sale plus an additional 50 miles of track and roadway assets, resulting in a $137 million recovery ($102 million after-tax) of the $486 million loss ($363 million after-tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2020 to adjust the carrying amount of the track and roadway assets to their then estimated net selling price.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of assets held for sale of $260 million was included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) approved the Company's agreement with the short line operator without condition and the transaction closed on January 28, 2022 and January 31, 2022 for the U.S. and Canadian assets, respectively. The resulting difference between the net selling price and what was estimated was insignificant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Constant currency\n\nFinancial results at constant currency allow results to be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons in the analysis of trends in business performance. Measures at constant currency are considered nonGAAP measures and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Financial results at constant currency are obtained by translating the current period results denominated in US dollars at the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate transactions denominated in US dollars of the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe average foreign exchange rates were $1.25 and $1.34 per US$1.00, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have been higher by $166 million ($0.23 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n| In millions, except per share data                   | Year ended December 31,   | 2021     | Constant  currency impact   | 2020   | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                             |                           |          |                             |        |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                              |                           | $  2,816 | $  128  $                   | 2,631  | 12%                                            |\n| Metals and minerals                                  |                           | 1,548    | 83                          | 1,409  | 16%                                            |\n| Forest products                                      |                           | 1,740    | 93                          | 1,700  | 8%                                             |\n| Coal                                                 |                           | 618      | 17                          | 527    | 20%                                            |\n| Grain and fertilizers                                |                           | 2,475    | 80                          | 2,609  | (2%)                                           |\n| Intermodal                                           |                           | 4,115    | 95                          | 3,751  | 12%                                            |\n| Automotive                                           |                           | 576      | 32                          | 591    | 3%                                             |\n| Total freight revenues                               |                           | 13,888   | 528                         | 13,218 | 9%                                             |\n| Other revenues                                       |                           | 589      | 29                          | 601    | 3%                                             |\n| Total revenues                                       |                           | 14,477   | 557                         | 13,819 | 9%                                             |\n| Operating expenses                                   |                           |          |                             |        |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                            |                           | 2,879    | 65                          | 2,723  | (8%)                                           |\n| Purchased services and material                      |                           | 2,082    | 60                          | 2,152  | -%                                             |\n| Fuel                                                 |                           | 1,513    | 94                          | 1,152  | (39%)                                          |\n| Depreciation and amortization                        |                           | 1,598    | 44                          | 1,589  | (3%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                      |                           | 336      | 19                          | 432    | 18%                                            |\n| Casualty and other                                   |                           | 506      | 27                          | 508    | (5%)                                           |\n| Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale              |                           | (137)    | (12)                        | 486    | 131%                                           |\n| Transaction-related costs                            |                           | 84       | 47                          | -

The increase of $658 million, or 5%, was mainly attributable to freight rate increases, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and an increase in intermodal ancillary services; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of Canadian grain in terms of RTMs compared to record volumes in 2020. Fuel surcharge revenues increased by $301 million in 2021, mainly due to higher applicable fuel surcharge rates.\n\nIn 2021, RTMs, measuring the weight and distance of freight transported by the Company, increased by 1% relative to 2020, despite the unfavorable impact of the ongoing supply chain challenges, the polar vortex in February, the forest fires and drought in Western Canada over the summer and the B.C. washouts in the fourth quarter of 2021. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 4% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly driven by a decrease in the average length of haul, freight rate increases and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Petroleum and chemicals\n\n|                       | 2021     | 2020     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  2,816 | $  2,631 | 7%         | 12%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 42,436   | 43,556   | (3%)       | (3%)                            |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 6.64     | 6.04     | 10%        | 15%                             |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 596      | 597      | -%         | -%                              |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group increased by $185 million, or 7%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to freight rate increases, increased volumes of natural gas liquids (principally propane) and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of petroleum crude.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 10% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to freight rate increases, including volume commitment amounts under customer contracts and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by negative translation impact of stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Lower incident costs and the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar were offset by an increase in insurance premiums and $20 million of advisory fees related to shareholder matters.\n\n## Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company recovered $137 million of the $486 million loss on assets held for sale recorded in the second quarter of 2020, resulting from the Company entering into an agreement for the sale of non-core lines. See Note 5 -Assets held for sale to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Transaction-related costs\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred transaction costs related to the terminated CN Merger Agreement of $84 million, consisting of $125 million of transaction-related costs; US$700 million ($845 million) paid to KCS; and the related refund received of US$700 million ($886 million) in the third quarter. See Note 3 -Acquisitions to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income and expenses\n\n## Interest expense\n\nIn 2021, Interest expense was $610 million compared to $554 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million; partly offset by a lower average level of debt and a positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2021, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $407 million compared to $292 million in 2020. (2) The increase was mainly due to lower interest cost, partly offset by higher amortization of net actuarial loss and lower expected return on plan assets.\n\n## Merger termination fee\n\nIn 2021, the Company received a US$700 million ($886 million) termination fee resulting from KCS terminating the CN Merger Agreement and entering into a merger agreement with CP. See Note 3 -Acquisitions to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income\n\nIn 2021, Other income was $43 million compared to $6 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to fluctuations in the fair value of the equity investment in autonomous driving technology and higher gains on disposal of land.\n\n## Income tax expense (1)\n\nIn 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,443 million compared to an income tax expense of $976 million in 2020. Included in the 2020 figure was a current income tax recovery of $141 million recorded in the first quarter, resulting from the enactment of the CARES Act.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which included corporate income tax measures allowing U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be fully carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the NOL. As a result of the CARES Act, the Company reclassified its 2019 deferred income tax asset of $213 million on the NOL that arose in 2019, to a current income tax receivable and recorded a current income tax recovery of $141 million in 2020 to reflect an amount recoverable at the higher U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% applicable to pre-2018 tax years.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2021 was 22.8% compared to 21.6% in 2020. Excluding the aforementioned income tax recovery, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 was 24.7%. (2) The decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the merger termination fee, transaction-related costs, and bridge financing and other fees resulting from the KCS transaction recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income, taxed at a lower inclusion rate.\n\n- (1) See Note 2 - Change in accounting policy to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n- (2) The adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure, defined as the effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the effect of the 2020 income tax recovery as it is not reflective of CN's underlying business operations. This measure does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to a similar measure presented by other companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Operating expenses reflect the impact of freight volumes, seasonal weather conditions, labor costs, fuel prices, and the Company's productivity initiatives. Fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar have also affected the conversion of the Company's US dollardenominated revenues and expenses and resulted in fluctuations in Net income in the rolling eight quarters presented above.\n\n## Summary of fourth quarter 2022\n\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $789 million, or 21%, to a record $4,542 million, when compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, freight rate increases and higher volumes of Canadian grain. Fuel surcharge revenues increased by $382 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly as a result of higher fuel prices. RTMs in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by 6% when compared to the same period in 2021. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 15% in the fourth quarter of 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021, mainly driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and freight rate increases.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $443 million, or 20%, to $2,630 million, when compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was mainly as a result of higher fuel prices and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $346 million, or 22%, to $1,912 million, when compared to the same period in 2021. The operating ratio was 57.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 58.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 0.4-point improvement.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1,420 million, an increase of $219 million, or 18%, when compared to the same period in 2021, and diluted earnings per share increased by 24% to $2.10.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Liquidity and capital resources\n\nThe Company's principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, which is supplemented by borrowings in the money markets and capital markets. To meet its short-term liquidity needs, the Company has access to various financing sources, including unsecured revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. In addition to these sources, the Company can use equipment loans or issue debt securities to meet its longer-term liquidity needs. The strong focus on cash generation from all sources gives the Company increased flexibility in terms of meeting its financing requirements.\n\nThe Company's primary short-term and long-term cash requirements are discussed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term cash requirements: includes working capital requirements, such as labor and fringe benefits, fuel, income tax instalments, pension contributions, and contractual obligations; interest and principal payments on current debt financing; dividends; and share repurchases.\n- \u00b7 Long-term cash requirements: includes capital expenditures relating to track infrastructure and other, interest and principal repayments of long-term debt financing, operating and finance lease obligations; business acquisitions and long-term contractual obligations.\n\nThe Company sets priorities on its uses of available funds based on short-term operational requirements, expenditures to continue to operate a safe railway and pursue strategic initiatives, while also considering its long-term contractual obligations and returning value to its shareholders; and as part of its financing strategy, the Company regularly reviews its capital structure, cost of capital, and the need for additional debt financing. For a summary of short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including material cash requirements related to such obligations, refer to the table within this section entitled Contractual obligations .\n\nThe Company has a working capital deficit, which is common in the capital-intensive rail industry, and is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. The Company maintains adequate resources to meet daily cash requirements, and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its dayto-day cash requirements and current obligations. As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $328 million and $838 million, respectively; Restricted cash and cash equivalents of $506 million and $503 million, respectively; and a working capital deficit of $625 million and a working capital surplus $306 million, respectively. (1) The cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for a minimum term of one month pursuant to the Company's bilateral letter of credit facilities are recorded as Restricted cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThere are currently no specific requirements relating to working capital other than in the normal course of business as discussed herein.\n\nThe Company's U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries maintain sufficient cash to meet their respective operational requirements. If the Company should require more liquidity in Canada than is generated by its domestic operations, the Company could decide to repatriate funds associated with undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, including its U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries. The impact on liquidity resulting from the repatriation of funds held outside Canada would not be significant as such repatriation of funds would not cause significant tax implications to the Company under the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and the tax treaties currently in effect between them.\n\nThe Company expects cash from operations and its various sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. The Company is not aware of any trends or expected fluctuations in its liquidity that would impact its ongoing operations or financial condition as of the date of this MD&A.\n\n## Available financing sources\n\n## Shelf prospectus and registration statement\n\nOn May 4, 2022, the Company filed a new shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators and a registration statement with the SEC, pursuant to which CN may issue up to $6.0 billion of debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets over a 25-month period following the filing date. This shelf prospectus and registration statement replaced CN's previous shelf prospectus and registration statement that expired on March 11, 2022.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the remaining capacity of this shelf prospectus and registration statement was $4.1 billion. Access to the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under the shelf prospectus and registration statement is dependent on market conditions.\n\nThe Company's access to long-term funds in the capital markets depends on its credit ratings and market conditions. The Company believes that it continues to have access to the capital markets. If the Company were unable to borrow funds at acceptable rates in the capital markets, the Company could borrow under its credit facilities, draw down on its accounts receivable securitization program, access the pledged cash under its letter of credit facilities, raise cash by disposing of surplus properties or otherwise monetizing assets, reduce discretionary spending or take a combination of these measures to assure that it has adequate funding for its business.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Revolving credit facilities\n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company's revolving credit facility agreement was amended, to extend the term of the credit facility by one year and transition from the benchmark on US borrowings from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The credit facility of $2.5 billion consists of a $1.25 billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2025 and a $1.25 billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2027. The revolving credit facility agreement is structured as a sustainability linked loan whereby its applicable margins are adjusted upon achievement of certain sustainability targets. The credit facility provides for borrowings at various benchmark interest rates, such as the SOFR and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings and sustainability targets. There is no fallback language for CDOR.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility.\n\nOn March 18, 2022, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion two-year unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a consortium of lenders. The credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and provides for borrowings at various benchmark interest rates, such as SOFR and CDOR, plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility.\n\n## Equipment loans\n\nThe Company has a secured non-revolving term loan credit facility for financing or refinancing the purchase of equipment. The equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facility have a tenor of 20 years, bear interest at variable rates such as LIBOR and CDOR plus a margin, are repayable in equal quarterly installments, are prepayable at any time without penalty, and are secured by rolling stock.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings of US$542 million ($734 million) and US$572 million ($723 million), respectively, and had no further amount available under this non-revolving term loan facility.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nThe Company has a commercial paper program in Canada and in the U.S. Both programs are backstopped by the Company's revolving credit facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount of commercial paper that can be issued is $2.5 billion, or the US dollar equivalent, on a combined basis. The commercial paper programs, which are subject to market rates in effect at the time of financing, provide the Company with a flexible financing alternative, and can be used for general corporate purposes. The cost of commercial paper and access to the commercial paper market in Canada and the U.S. are dependent on credit ratings and market conditions. If the Company were to lose access to its commercial paper program for an extended period of time, the Company could rely on its revolving credit facilities to meet its short-term liquidity needs.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of US$594 million ($805 million) and US$111 million ($140 million), respectively, presented in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization program\n\nThe Company has an agreement to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in a revolving pool of accounts receivable to unrelated trusts for maximum cash proceeds of $450 million. On January 19, 2023, the Company extended the term of its agreement by one year to February 1, 2025. The trusts are multi-seller trusts and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Funding for the acquisition of these assets is customarily through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper notes by the unrelated trusts.\n\nThe Company has retained the responsibility for servicing, administering and collecting the receivables sold. The average servicing period is approximately one month and the interest on borrowings under the Accounts receivable securitization program is renewed based on commercial paper rates then in effect or SOFR or CDOR if the commercial paper market is inaccessible and includes fallback language that allows for the succession of CDOR to an alternative rate consistent with market convention. Subject to customary indemnifications, each trust's recourse is limited to the accounts receivable transferred.\n\nThe accounts receivable securitization program provides the Company with readily available short-term financing for general corporate use. In the event the program is terminated before its scheduled maturity, the Company expects to meet its future payment obligations through its various sources of financing including its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, and/or access to capital markets.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, and 2021 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program.\n\n## Bilateral letter of credit facilities\n\nThe Company has a series of committed and uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facility agreements. On March 31, 2022, the Company extended the maturity date of certain committed bilateral letter of credit facility agreements to April 28, 2025. The agreements are held with various banks to support the Company's requirements to post letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, the Company has the option from time to time to pledge collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents, for a minimum term of one month, equal to at least the face value of the letters of credit issued.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Rating downgrades could limit the Company's access to the capital markets, or increase its borrowing costs.\n\nThe following table provides the Company's long-term debt and commercial paper credit ratings as of the date of this MD&A, which remain unchanged from 2021.\n\n|                           | Outlook   | Long-term debt rating  (1)   | Commercial paper rating  (1)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| DBRS Morningstar          | Stable    | A                            | R-1 (low)                      |\n| Moody's Investors Service | Negative  | A2                           | P-1                            |\n| Standard & Poor's         | Negative  | A                            | A-1                            |\n\n## Cash flows\n\nThe following table provides the cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n| In millions                                                                                                          | Year ended December 31,   | 2022     | 2021     | Variance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Net cash provided by operating activities                                                                            |                           | $  6,667 | $  6,971 | $  (304)   |\n| Net cash used in investing activities                                                                                |                           | (2,510)  | (2,873)  | 363        |\n| Net cash used in financing activities                                                                                |                           | (4,667)  | (3,857)  | (810)      |\n| Effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and  restricted cash equivalents |                           | 3        | -        | 3          |\n| Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and  restricted cash equivalents                 |                           | (507)    | 241      | (748)      |\n| Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents,  beginning of year                         |                           | 1,341    | 1,100    | 241        |\n| Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents, end of year                                | $                         | 834      | $  1,341 | $  (507)   |\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate cash for debt obligations and for discretionary uses such as payment of dividends, share repurchases and strategic opportunities. The Company defines its free cash flow measure as the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for the impact of (i) business acquisitions and (ii) merger transaction-related payments, cash receipts and cash income taxes, which are items that are not indicative of operating trends. Free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\n|",

Pension contributions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $70 million and $127 million, respectively. The 2021 contributions are mainly attributable to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, for the current service cost as determined by the actuarial valuation as at December 31, 2020. For 2022, given the fully funded status of the CN Pension Plan as determined by the latest actuarial valuation for funding purposes as at December 31, 2021, the Company was prohibited from making contributions once the actuarial valuation report was filed in April 2022.\n\nBased on the anticipated results of the Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes, the CN Pension Plan is expected to remain fully funded and at a level such that the Company would continue to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan in 2023. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $55 million for all pension plans in 2023.\n\nSee the section of this MD&A entitled Critical accounting estimates - Pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information pertaining to the funding of the Company's pension plans. Additional information relating to the pension plans is provided in Note 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Income tax payments\n\nThe Company is required to make scheduled instalment payments as prescribed by the tax authorities. In Canada, the Company's domestic jurisdiction, tax instalments in a given year are generally based on the prior year's taxable income whereas in the U.S., the Company's predominant foreign jurisdiction, they are based on forecasted taxable income of the current year.\n\nIn 2022, net income tax payments were $1,288 million (2021 - $759 million). The increase was mostly due to higher required instalment payments in Canada and in the U.S. mainly caused by higher pre-tax income and the merger termination fee recorded in 2021.\n\nFor 2023, the Company's net income tax payments are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. The increase is mostly due to higher required instalment payments caused by higher expected pre-tax income.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $363 million in 2022 when compared to 2021, mainly due to proceeds received from the assets held for sale and lower property additions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

These investments will enable and support the growth of the Company and will be financed with cash generated from operations or with cash from financing activities as required.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $810 million in 2022 when compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher repurchases of common shares; partly offset by higher issuance of long-term debt and higher issuance of commercial paper.\n\n## Debt financing activities\n\nDebt financing activities in 2022 included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 On November 15, 2022, repayment of US$250 million ($332 million) 2.25% Notes due 2022 upon maturity;\n- \u00b7 On August 5, 2022, issuance of US$800 million ($1,028 million) 3.85% Notes due 2032 and US$700 million ($900 million) 4.40% Notes due 2052, in the U.S. capital markets, which resulted in total net proceeds of $1,901 million. In conjunction with this debt issuance, CN settled a notional US$675 million ($868 million) of treasury locks, resulting in a cumulative loss of $2 million. This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 23 - Financial instruments to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information);\n- \u00b7 Repayment of equipment loans of $40 million;\n- \u00b7 Net issuance of commercial paper of $563 million; and\n- \u00b7 Repayment of finance leases of $7 million.\n\nDebt financing activities in 2021 included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 On September 15, 2021, early redemption of US$400 million ($506 million) 2.85% Notes due 2021;\n- \u00b7 On March 31, 2021, issuance of US$310 million ($389 million) equipment loan under the non-revolving credit facility;\n- \u00b7 On January 18, 2021, early redemption of $250 million 2.75% Notes due 2021;\n- \u00b7 Repayment of equipment loans of $33 million;\n- \u00b7 Net issuance of commercial paper of $66 million; and\n- \u00b7 Repayment of finance leases of $68 million.\n\nCash obtained from the issuance of debt was used for general corporate purposes, including the redemption and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness and share repurchases. Additional information relating to the Company's outstanding debt securities is provided in Note 16 Debt to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n|",

Following the termination of the CN Merger Agreement, the Company resumed share repurchases at the end of September 2021.\n\nPrevious NCIBs allowed for the repurchase of up to 14.0 million common shares between February 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022, and up to 16.0 million common shares between February 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021.\n\nThe following table provides the information related to the share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions, except per share data    | Year ended December 31,   | 2022   | 2021      | 2020      |     | Total NCIB   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|--------------|\n| February 2022 - January 2023 NCIB     |                           |        |           |           |     |              |\n| Number of common shares               |                           | 29.4   | N/A       | N/A       |     | 29.4         |\n| Weighted-average price per share  (1) |                           | 156.06 | N/A       | N/A       |     | $  156.06    |\n| Amount of repurchase  (1)             |                           | 4,591  | N/A       | N/A       |     | $  4,591     |\n| February 2021 - January 2022 NCIB     |                           |        |           |           |     |              |\n| Number of common shares               |                           | 0.8    | 10.3      | N/A       |     | 11.1         |\n| Weighted-average price per share  (1) |                           | 153.54 | $  153.69 | N/A       |     | $  153.68    |\n| Amount of repurchase  (1)             |                           | 118    | $  1,582  | N/A       |     | $  1,700     |\n| February 2020 - January 2021 NCIB     |                           |        |           |           |     |              |\n| Number of common shares               |                           | N/A    | -         | 2.0       |     | 2.0          |\n| Weighted-average price per share  (1) |                           | N/A    | $  -      | $  113.56 | $   | 113.56       |\n| Amount of repurchase  (1)             |                           | N/A    | $  -      | $  226    | $   | 226          |\n| Total for the year                    |                           |        |           |           |     |              |\n| Number of common shares               |                           | 30.2   | 10.3      | 3.3       | (2) |              |\n| Weighted-average price per share  (1) |                           | 156.00 | $  153.69 | $  116.97 | (2) |              |\n| Amount of repurchase  (1)             |                           | 4,709  | $  1,582  | $  379    | (2) |              |\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new NCIB, which allows for the repurchase of up to 32.0 million common shares between February 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA imposes a one percent excise tax on specified repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations, effective for repurchases after December 31, 2022. The amount on which the tax is imposed is reduced by the value of any stock issued by such corporation during the tax year. This provision currently does not impact CN. Future regulations and interpretations are expected to be issued to clarify how the excise tax will be applied in practice and may alter the Company's initial assessment. Payments of this excise tax, if it became applicable, would increase the cost of making repurchases. It would not, however, affect the Company's results of operations as they would be accounted for as direct costs of common share repurchases and recorded within Total shareholders' equity.\n\nOn November 3, 2022, the Canadian government announced its intention to introduce a new two percent tax on repurchases of stock by a public corporation, effective for repurchases beginning January 1, 2024. Further details are expected to be provided in March or April of 2023 when the Canadian government tables its 2023 Budget; however it is expected that this proposed tax will be similar to the one percent excise tax provision enacted by the U.S. government on August 16, 2022. The Company continues to monitor the developments of this announcement. If this proposed two percent tax on repurchases of stock is enacted, it is expected to affect the Company. Payments of this excise tax, if it became applicable, would increase the cost of making repurchases. It would not, however, affect the Company's results of operations as they would be accounted for as direct costs of common share repurchases and recorded within Total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Company's NCIB notices may be found online on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov through EDGAR. Printed copies may be obtained by contacting the Corporate Secretary's Office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company calculates the adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple as adjusted debt divided by the last twelve months of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted debt is defined as the sum of Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt as reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as Operating lease liabilities, including current portion and pension plans in deficiency recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the debt-like nature of their contractual and financial obligations. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net income excluding Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, operating lease cost, Other components of net periodic benefit income, Other income (loss), and other significant items that are not reflective of CN's underlying business operations and which could distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures used to compute the Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of debt and Net income in accordance with GAAP, reported as at and for the years en December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA, which have been used to calculate the non-GAAP adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple:\n\n| In millions, unless otherwise indicated                      | As at and for the year ended December 31,                    | 2022      | 2021      | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Debt                                                         | Debt                                                         | $  15,429 | $  12,485 | 12,906 |\n| Adjustments:                                                 | Adjustments:                                                 |           |           |        |\n| Operating lease liabilities, including current portion   (1) | Operating lease liabilities, including current portion   (1) | 466       | 430       | 418    |\n| Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                             | Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                             | 353       | 447       | 553    |\n| Adjusted debt                                                | Adjusted debt                                                | $  16,248 | $  13,362 | 13,877 |\n| Net income  (3) $                                            | Net income  (3) $                                            | 5,118     | $  4,899  | 3,545  |\n| Interest expense                                             | Interest expense                                             | 548       | 610       | 554    |\n| Income tax expense  (3)                                      | Income tax expense  (3)                                      | 1,645     | 1,443     | 976    |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                | Depreciation and amortization                                | 1,729     | 1,598     | 1,589  |\n| Operating lease cost  (4)                                    | Operating lease cost  (4)                                    | 142       | 131       | 143    |\n| Other components of net periodic benefit income  (3)         | Other components of net periodic benefit income  (3)         | (498)     | (407)     | (292)  |\n| Other loss (income)                                          | Other loss (income)                                          | 27        | (43)      | (6)    |\n| Adjustments:                                                 | Adjustments:                                                 |           |           |        |\n| Workforce reduction program  (5)                             | Workforce reduction program  (5)                             | -         | 39        | -      |\n| Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (6)            | Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (6)            | 22        | 20        | -      |\n| Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale  (7)                 | Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale  (7)                 | -         | (137)     | 486    |\n| Transaction-related costs  (8)                               | Transaction-related costs  (8)                               | -         | 84        | -      |\n| Merger termination fee  (9)                                  | Merger termination fee  (9)                                  | -         | (886)     | -      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                              | Adjusted EBITDA                                              | $  8,733  | $  7,351  | 6,995  |\n| Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)           | Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)           | 1.86      | 1.82      | 1.98   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

See the section of this MD&A entitled Forward-looking statements for a discussion of assumptions and risk factors affecting such forward-looking statements.\n\n## Off balance sheet arrangements\n\n## Guarantees and indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may involve providing guarantees or indemnifications to third parties and others, which may extend beyond the term of the agreements. These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded a liability with respect to guarantees and indemnifications. Additional information relating to guarantees and indemnifications is provided in Note 22 - Major commitments and contingencies to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Outstanding share data\n\nAs at January 31, 2023, the Company had 668.5 million common shares and 3.8 million stock options outstanding.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company follows a financial risk management framework, which is monitored and approved by the Company's Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal cost of capital and preserving its liquidity. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments in the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from cash and temporary investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. To manage credit risk associated with cash and temporary investments, the Company places these financial assets with governments, major financial institutions, or other creditworthy counterparties, and performs ongoing reviews of these entities. To manage credit risk associated with accounts receivable, the Company reviews the credit history of each new customer, monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers, and keeps the average daily sales outstanding within an acceptable range. The Company works with customers to ensure timely payments, and in certain cases, requires financial security, including letters of credit. CN also obtains credit insurance for certain high risk customers. Although the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of customer credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The Company considers the risk due to the possible non-performance by its customers to be remote.\n\nThe Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, however from time to time, it may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the counterparty risk associated with the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company enters into contracts with major financial institutions that have been accorded investment grade ratings. Though the Company is exposed to potential credit losses due to non-performance of these counterparties, the Company considers this risk to be remote.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that sufficient funds will not be available to satisfy financial obligations as they come due. In addition to cash generated from operations, which represents its principal source of liquidity, the Company manages liquidity risk by aligning other external sources of funds which can be obtained upon short notice, such as revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. As well, the Company can issue debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under its shelf prospectus and\n\n|",

The Company's access to long-term funds in the debt capital markets depends on its credit ratings and market conditions. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets. See the section of this MD&A entitled Liquidity and capital resources for additional information relating to the Company's available financing sources and its credit ratings.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar affect the Company's revenues and expenses. To manage foreign currency risk, the Company designates US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. As a result, from the dates of designation, foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the Company's US dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase a notional value of US$1,311 million (2021 - US$910 million). These outstanding contracts are at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.33 per US$1.00 (2021 - $1.27 per US$1.00) with exchange rates ranging from $1.29 to $1.37 per US$1.00 (2021 - $1.25 to $1.28 per US$1.00). The weighted-average term of the contracts is 157 days (2021 - 251 days) with terms ranging from 29 days to 300 days (2021 - 112 days to 352 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $129 million (2021 - loss of $18 million; 2020 - loss of $3 million), related to foreign exchange forward contracts. These gains and losses were largely offset by the re-measurement of US dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in Other income. As at December 31, 2022, the fair value of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $33 million and $4 million, respectively (2021 - $nil and $2 million, respectively).\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar is approximately $30 million.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, the Company manages its borrowings in line with liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements. During the year, CN entered into treasury lock agreements to hedge US Treasury benchmark rates related to an expected debt issuance in 2022. The treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedging instruments with cumulative gains or losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in derivative instruments. On August 5, 2022, CN settled a notional US$675 million ($868 million) of treasury locks in conjunction with the issuances of US$800 million ($1,028 million) Notes due 2032 and US$700 million ($900 million) Notes due 2052, resulting in a cumulative loss of $2 million. This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, there were no treasury locks outstanding.\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-percent change in the interest rate on floating rate debt is approximately $15 million.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to purchases of fuel and the potential reduction in Net income due to increases in the price of diesel. Fuel prices are impacted by geopolitical events, changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Fuel shortages can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, climate, and labor and political instability.\n\nThe Company manages fuel price risk by offsetting the impact of rising fuel prices with the Company's fuel surcharge program. The surcharge applied to customers is determined in the second calendar month prior to the month in which it is applied, and is generally calculated using the average monthly price of On-Highway Diesel, and, to a lesser extent, West-Texas Intermediate crude oil.\n\nWhile the Company's fuel surcharge program provides effective coverage, residual exposure remains given that fuel price risk cannot be completely managed due to timing and given the volatility in the market. As such, the Company may enter into derivative instruments to manage such risk when considered appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe financial instruments that the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value. These financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill and other, is classified as Level 1 with gains and losses being recorded in Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as Level 2 and is used to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities. The fair value of assets held for sale, included in Other current assets is classified as Level 3. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 6 - Assets held for sale to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2022, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $15,419 million (2021 - $12,475 million) and a fair value of $14,137 million (2021 - $14,424 million). The carrying amount of debt excluding finance leases exceeded the fair value due to an increase in market rates compared to the stated coupon rate.\n\n## Recent accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following recent Accounting Standards Update (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) came into effect during the current year and has been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2021-10 Disclosures by business entities about government assistance (Topic 832)\n\nThe ASU will increase the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of types of assistance, an entity's accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity's financial statements.\n\nThe Company adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an effective date of January 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard has been applied to existing government assistance transactions. See Note 12 - Properties to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nThe following recent ASUs issued by the FASB were issued in 2020, were amended in 2021 as well as in 2022 and have not been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06 Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and related amendments\n\nUSD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) are benchmark interest rates referenced in a variety of agreements. The publication of certain LIBOR and CDOR rates were discontinued in January 2022 and May 2021, respectively, and the remaining rates are expected to be discontinued on June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The recommended alternative reference rates for LIBOR and CDOR are the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), respectively.\n\nThe ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity.\n\nThe ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2024, following the amendments of ASU 2022-06. The Company has a non-revolving credit facility that references LIBOR and CDOR for which the alternative reference rate is expected to be SOFR and CORRA, respectively. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facility referencing LIBOR with outstanding borrowings of US$542 million (see Note 16 -Debt to the Company's\n\n|",

The equipment loans will be impacted by the discontinuance of the remaining LIBOR rates and the Company has fallback language that allows for the succession of LIBOR to SOFR.\n\nThe Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, and whether it will elect to apply any of the optional expedients and exceptions provided in the ASU.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2022 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company's policies for income taxes, capital expenditures, depreciation, pensions and other postretirement benefits, personal injury and other claims and environmental matters, require management's more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and, as such, are considered to be critical. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\n\nManagement discusses the development and selection of the Company's critical accounting policies, including the underlying estimates and assumptions, with the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee has reviewed the Company's related disclosures.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As a result, a projection of taxable income is required for those years, as well as an assumption of the ultimate recovery/settlement period for temporary differences. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred income tax assets, and if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2022, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $2.3 billion, and, based upon the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income of the necessary character over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, and the reversal of taxable temporary differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.\n\nIn addition, Canadian, or domestic, tax rules and regulations, as well as those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by the Company that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit of the filed income tax returns. Tax benefits are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxation authorities. As at December 31, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $52 million, before considering tax treaties and other arrangements between taxation authorities. The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 was $38 million. If recognized, $15 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $12 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations, and will not significantly affect the effective tax rate as they are mainly related to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to lease liabilities, the pension liability, accruals for personal injury and other claims, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, compensation reserves, and other postretirement benefits liability. The Company's deferred income tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences related to properties, the pension asset and operating lease right-of-use assets. These deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

As a result, fiscal budget changes and/or changes in income tax laws that affect a change in the timing, the amount, and/or the income tax rate at which the temporary difference components will reverse, could materially affect deferred income tax expense as recorded in the Company's results of operations. The reversal of temporary differences is expected at future-enacted income tax rates which could change due to fiscal budget changes and/or changes in income tax laws. As a result, a change in the timing and/or the income tax rate at which the components will reverse, could materially affect deferred income tax expense as recorded in the Company's results of operations. From time to time, the federal, provincial, and state governments enact new corporate income tax rates resulting in either lower or higher tax liabilities. A one-percentage-point change in the Canadian and U.S. statutory federal tax rate would have the effect of changing the deferred income tax expense by $208 million and $157 million in 2022, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,645 million, of which $404 million was a deferred income tax expense.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,443 million, of which $513 million was a deferred income tax expense. (1) The current income tax expense included a recovery of $141 million resulting from the enactment of the CARES Act.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $976 million, of which $481 million was a deferred income tax expense. (1) The deferred income tax expense included a recovery of $112 million resulting from the enactment of a lower provincial corporate income tax rate.\n\nThe Company's net deferred income tax liability as at December 31, 2022 was $9,796 million (2021 - $9,303 million). Additional disclosures are provided in Note 8 - Income taxes to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- (1) See Note 2 - Change in accounting policy to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The Company has a process in place to determine whether or not costs qualify for capitalization, which requires judgment. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years, except for rail and ballast whose services lives are measured in millions of gross tons. The Company follows the group method of depreciation whereby a single composite depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a class of similar assets, despite small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\nFor all depreciable assets, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated service lives of properties requires judgment and is based on currently available information, including periodic depreciation studies conducted by the Company. The Company's U.S. properties are subject to comprehensive depreciation studies as required by the STB and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe studies consider, among other factors, the analysis of historical retirement data using recognized life analysis techniques, and the forecasting of asset life characteristics. Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, changes to the Company's business strategy, changes in the Company's capital strategy or changes in regulations can result in the actual service lives differing from the Company's estimates.\n\nA change in the remaining service life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation rate used to amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation expense as reported in the Company's results of operations. A change of one year in the composite service life of the Company's fixed asset base would impact annual depreciation expense by approximately $72 million.\n\nDepreciation studies are a means of ensuring that the assumptions used to estimate the service lives of particular asset groups are still valid and where they are not, they serve as the basis to establish the new depreciation rates to be used on a prospective basis. In 2022, the Company completed depreciation studies for track properties and as a result, the Company changed the estimated service lives for various types of track assets and their related composite depreciation rates. The results of these depreciation studies did not materially affect the Company's annual depreciation expense.\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost is removed from the asset account and the difference between its cost and estimated related accumulated depreciation (net\n\n|",

The historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, first-out approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded total depreciation expense of $1,723 million (2021 - $1,593 million; 2020 $1,583 million). As at December 31, 2022, the Company had Properties of $43,537 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $16,526 million (2021 - $41,178 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $15,093 million). Additional disclosures are provided in Note 12 - Properties to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nGAAP requires the use of historical cost as the basis of reporting in financial statements. As a result, the cumulative effect of inflation, which has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies such as CN, is not reflected in operating expenses. Depreciation charges on an inflation-adjusted basis, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.\n\n## Pensions\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, CN elected to change its accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The new accounting method changes the calculation of market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost but has no impact on the annual funded status of the plans. The Company's previous methodology calculated market-related value for pensions whereby realized and unrealized gains/losses and appreciation/depreciation in the value of the investments were recognized over a period of five years. The Company's new methodology will apply a corridor approach so that the marketrelated value does not result in a value that deviates excessively from its fair value. Specifically, the market-related value will not exceed 110% or be less than 90% of the fair value. This change establishes a corridor approach whereby the amount causing the market-related value to be outside of the 10% corridor will be recognized immediately in the market-related value of assets and will not be subject to the five-year period of recognition. There is no change in the recognition approach for investment income.\n\n## Pensions and other postretirement benefits\n\nThe Company's plans have a measurement date of December 31. The following table provides the Company's pension asset, pension liability and other postretirement benefits liability as at December 31, 2022, and 2021:\n\n| In millions                                  | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Pension asset                                | $  3,033 | $  3,050 |\n| Pension liability                            | $  353   | $  447   |\n| Other postretirement benefits liability  (1) | $  147   | $  212   |\n\nThe descriptions in the following paragraphs pertaining to pensions relate generally to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Amendments to postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S.\n\nIn June 2022, CN approved changes affecting members participating in the Company's postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S. Beginning in 2023, Medicare-eligible retirees will be covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees will continue to be covered by the existing selfinsured program. This change constitutes a plan amendment event resulting in a $28 million reduction to the affected plans' Accumulated projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income, and is composed of a prior service credit of $21 million and an actuarial gain of $7 million, substantially all due to lower expected future benefit payments and to the approximate 130 basis point increase in the end of period discount rates between the prior year end and May 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Curtailment event\n\nOn October 31, 2021, the CN Board of Directors approved changes affecting non-unionized members participating in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial gain, mostly due to reflecting projected future salary increases and service only up to April 1, 2024. The curtailment event also triggered an interim re-measurement of the funded status of the affected defined benefit pension plans resulting in an actuarial gain of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between December 31, 2020 (2.55%) and October 31, 2021 (3.39%), and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns ($982 million) compared to expected returns ($875 million) over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n## Calculation of net periodic benefit cost (income)\n\nIn accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, assumptions are required for, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, employee early retirements, terminations and disability. Changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). The Company generally amortizes these gains or losses into net periodic benefit cost (income) over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess of the corridor threshold, which is calculated as 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The Company's net periodic benefit cost (income) for future periods is dependent on demographic experience, economic conditions and investment performance. Recent demographic experience has revealed no material net gains or losses on termination, retirement, disability and mortality. Experience with respect to economic conditions and investment performance is further discussed herein.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated net periodic benefit cost (income) for pensions and other postretirement benefits were as follows:\n\n| In millions                                                 | Year ended December 31,   | 2022   | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Net periodic benefit income for pensions  (1)               | $                         | (340)  | $  (210) | $  (118) |\n| Net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits | $                         | 1  $   | 2        | $  3     |\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the projected pension benefit obligation and accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation were as follows:\n\n| In millions                                         | December 31,   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Projected pension benefit obligation                | $  13,909      | $      | 17,813 |\n| Accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation | $              | 147  $ | 212    |\n\n## Discount rate assumption\n\nThe Company's discount rate assumption, which is set annually at the end of each year, is determined by management with the aid of thirdparty actuaries. The discount rate is used to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with a rating of AA or better, would provide the necessary cash flows to pay for pension benefits as they become due. For the Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans, future expected benefit payments are discounted using spot rates based on a derived AA corporate bond yield curve for each maturity year. A year-end discount rate of 5.26% based on bond yields prevailing at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 3.15%) was considered appropriate by the Company.\n\nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to measure current service cost and interest cost for all defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation are applied to the relevant projected cash flows for current service cost at the relevant maturity. More specifically, current service cost is measured using the cash flows related to benefits expected to be accrued in the following year by active\n\n|",

A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $325 million to the funded status for pensions and would result in a decrease of approximately $6 million to the 2023 projected net periodic benefit income.\n\n## Expected long-term rate of return assumption\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return is determined based on expected future performance for each asset class and is weighted based on the investment policy. Consideration is taken of the historical performance, the premium return generated from an actively managed portfolio, as well as current target asset allocations, published market return expectations, economic developments, inflation rates and administrative expenses. Based on these factors, the rate is determined by the Company. For 2022, the Company used a long-term rate of return assumption of 7.00% on the market-related value of plan assets to compute net periodic benefit cost (income). In 2023, the Company will increase the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 60 basis points to 7.60% to reflect management's current view of long-term investment returns.\n\nThe assets of the Company's various plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, geography, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIPP) which includes the plans' long-term target asset allocation (\"Policy\") and related benchmark indices. This Policy is based on the long-term expectations of the economy and financial market returns and considers the dynamics of the plans' benefit obligations. In 2022, the Policy was amended to implement a target asset allocation change to bonds and mortgages, equities and investmentrelated liabilities. These changes were taken into account in the determination of the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption. In 2022, the Policy was: 2% cash and short-term investments, 38% bonds and mortgages, 2% emerging market debt, 3% private debt, 32% equities, 4% real estate, 5% resource and royalties, 4% infrastructure, 2% specialty portfolio, 12% absolute return investments and negative 4% for investment-related liabilities.\n\nAnnually, the CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plans, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the Plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan asset allocation to the Policy and Strategy and compares the actual performance of the Company's pension plan assets to the performance of the benchmark indices.\n\nThe Committee's approval is required for all major investments in illiquid securities. The SIPP allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to implement strategies, to hedge and to adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe actual, market-related value and expected rates of return on plan assets for the last five years were as follows:\n\n|                      | 2022    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Actual               | (14.2%) | 8.7%   | 12.5%  | 12.2%  | (2.4%) |\n| Market-related value | 2.8%    | 8.0%   | 7.1%   | 6.1%   | 5.7%   |\n| Expected             | 7.00%   | 6.79%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  |\n\nThe Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management's view of long-term investment returns and the effect of a 1% variation in such rate of return would result in a change to the net periodic benefit cost (income) of approximately $105 million.\n\nManagement's assumption of the expected long-term rate of return is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual rate of return to differ materially from management's assumption. There can be no assurance that the plan assets will be able to earn the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Net periodic benefit income for pensions for 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Company expects net periodic benefit income to be approximately $390 million for all its defined benefit pension plans, as compared to actual net periodic benefit income of $340 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Plan asset allocation\n\nBased on the fair value of the assets held as at December 31, 2022, the assets of the Company's various plans are comprised of 3% in cash and short-term investments, 35% in bonds and mortgages, 2% in emerging market debt, 6% in private debt, 30% in equities, 3% in real estate, 7% in resource and royalties, 4% in infrastructure, 2% in specialty portfolio, 15% in absolute return investments, 1% in alternative risk premia investments and negative 8% in investment-related liabilities. See Note 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value measurements of such assets.\n\nA significant portion of the plans' assets are invested in publicly traded equity securities whose return is primarily driven by stock market performance. Debt securities also account for a significant portion of the plans' investments and provide a partial offset to the variation in the pension benefit obligation that is driven by changes in the discount rate. The funded status of the plan fluctuates with market conditions and impacts funding requirements. The Company will continue to make contributions to the pension plans that as a minimum meet pension legislative requirements.\n\n## Rate of compensation increase\n\nThe rate of compensation increase is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans for such increases. For 2022, a basic rate of compensation increase of 2.75% was used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost (income).\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) published in 2014 a report on Canadian Pensioners' Mortality (\"Report\"). The Report contained Canadian pensioners' mortality tables and improvement scales based on experience studies conducted by the CIA. The CIA's conclusions were taken into account in selecting management's best estimate mortality assumption used to calculate the projected benefit obligation as at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Funding of pension plans\n\nThe Company's main Canadian defined benefit pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, accounts for 93% of the Company's pension obligation and can produce significant volatility in pension funding requirements, given the pension fund's size, the many factors that drive the plan's funded status, and Canadian statutory pension funding requirements. Adverse changes to the assumptions used to calculate the plan's funding status, particularly the discount rate used for funding purposes, as well as changes to existing federal pension legislation, regulation and guidance could significantly impact the Company's future contributions.\n\nFor accounting purposes, the funded status is calculated under generally accepted accounting principles for all pension plans. For funding purposes, the funded status is also calculated under going concern and solvency scenarios as prescribed under pension legislation and subject to guidance issued by the CIA and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) for all registered Canadian defined benefit pension plans. The Company's funding requirements are determined upon completion of actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations are generally required on an annual basis for all Canadian defined benefit pension plans, or when deemed appropriate by the OSFI. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Company's most recently filed actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined pension plans conducted as at December 31, 2021 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.2 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $1.1 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit Standards Regulations, 1985 . The federal pension legislation requires funding deficits, if any, to be paid over a number of years, as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nThe Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans required as at December 31, 2022 will be performed in 2023. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.4 billion, while on a solvency basis a funding excess of approximately $1.6 billion is expected.\n\nBased on the anticipated results of these valuations, the CN Pension Plan is expected to remain fully funded and at a level such that the Company would continue to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $55 million for all of the Company's pension plans in 2023. The Company expects cash from operations and its other sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its 2023 funding obligations.\n\n|",

As such, the provision for employee injury claims is discounted. In the provinces where the Company is self-insured, costs related to employee work-related injuries are accounted for based on actuarially developed estimates of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. An actuarial study is generally performed at least on a triennial basis. For all other legal actions, the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded a decrease of $11 million, $11 million and $13 million, respectively, to its provision for personal injuries in Canada as a result of actuarial valuations for employee injury claims.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in Canada was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   |        | 2022 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|-------------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  182 | $  206      | $  207 |\n| Accruals and other            | 16     | 12          | 31     |\n| Payments                      | (30)   | (36)        | (32)   |\n| End of year                   | $  168 | $  182      | $  206 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  27  | $  50       | $  68  |\n\nThe assumptions used in estimating the ultimate costs for Canadian employee injury claims include, among other factors, the discount rate, the rate of inflation, wage increases and health care costs. The Company periodically reviews its assumptions to reflect currently available information. Over the past three years, the Company has not had to significantly change any of these assumptions. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect Casualty and other expense as reported in the Company's results of operations.\n\nFor all other legal claims in Canada, estimates are based on the specifics of the case, trends and judgment.\n\n## United States\n\nPersonal injury claims by the Company's employees, including claims alleging occupational disease and work-related injuries, are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). Employees are compensated under FELA for damages assessed based on a finding of fault through the U.S. jury system or through individual settlements. As such, the provision is undiscounted. With limited exceptions where claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Company follows an actuarial-based approach and accrues the expected cost for personal injury, including asserted and unasserted occupational disease claims, and property damage claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost. An actuarial study is performed annually.\n\nFor employee work-related injuries, including asserted occupational disease claims, and third-party claims, including grade crossing, trespasser and property damage claims, the actuarial valuation considers, among other factors, the Company's historical patterns of claims filings and payments. For unasserted occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation includes the projection of the Company's experience into the future considering the potentially exposed population. The Company adjusts its liability based upon management's assessment and the results of the study. On an ongoing basis, management reviews and compares the assumptions inherent in the latest actuarial valuation with the current claim experience and, if required, adjustments to the liability are recorded.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events, including events related to occupational diseases, which include but are not limited to, the timing and number of actual claims, the average cost per claim and the legislative and judicial environment, the Company's future payments may differ from current amounts recorded.\n\nIn 2022, the Company recorded a decrease of $9 million to its provision for U.S. personal injury and other claims attributable to nonoccupational disease claims, third-party claims and occupational disease claims pursuant to the 2022 actuarial valuation. In 2021 and 2020, actuarial valuations resulted in a decrease of $20 million and a decrease of $10 million, respectively. The prior years' adjustments from the actuarial valuations were mainly attributable to non-occupational disease claims, third -party claims and occupational disease claims, reflecting changes in the Company's estimates of unasserted claims and costs related to asserted claims. The Company has an ongoing risk mitigation strategy focused on reducing the frequency and severity of claims through injury prevention and containment; mitigation of claims; and lower settlements of existing claims.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in the U.S. was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  125 | $  141 | $  145 |\n| Accruals and other            | 33     | 30     | 28     |\n| Payments                      | (39)   | (45)   | (29)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | 9      | (1)    | (3)    |\n| End of year                   | $  128 | $  125 | $  141 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  18  | $  25  | $  41  |\n\nFor the U.S. personal injury and other claims liability, historical claim data is used to formulate assumptions relating to the expected number of claims and average cost per claim for each year. Changes in any one of these assumptions could materially affect Casualty and other expense as reported in the Company's results of operations. A 5% change in the asbestos average claim cost would result in an increase or decrease in the liability recorded of approximately $1 million and a 1% change in the inflation trend rate for all injury types would result in an increase or decrease in the liability recorded of approximately $2 million.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\n## Known existing environmental concerns\n\nThe Company is or may be liable for remediation costs at individual sites, in some cases along with other potentially responsible parties, associated with actual or alleged contamination. The ultimate cost of addressing these known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established given that the estimated environmental liability for any given site may vary depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the nature of anticipated response actions, taking into account the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As a result, liabilities are recorded based on the results of a four-phase assessment conducted on a site-by-site basis. A liability is initially recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the costs related to a particular site using cost scenarios established by external consultants based on the extent of contamination and expected costs for remedial efforts. In the case of multiple parties, the Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective share of the liability. Adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as additional information becomes available.\n\nThe Company's provision for specific environmental sites is undiscounted and includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as monitoring costs. Environmental expenses, which are classified as Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants as well as adjustments to initial estimates. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for specific environmental sites was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  56  | $  59  | $  57  |\n| Accruals and other            | 27     | 23     | 44     |\n| Payments                      | (26)   | (26)   | (42)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | 2      | -      | -      |\n| End of year                   | $  59  | $  56  | $  59  |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  41  | $  38  | $  46  |\n\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of the liability at December 31, 2022 will be paid out over the next five years. Based on the information currently available, the Company considers its provisions to be adequate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Unknown existing environmental concerns\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs. The magnitude of such additional liabilities and the costs of complying with future environmental laws and containing or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated due to many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the lack of specific technical information available with respect to many sites;\n- \u00b7 the absence of any government authority, third-party orders, or claims with respect to particular sites;\n- \u00b7 the potential for new or changed laws and regulations and for development of new remediation technologies and uncertainty regarding the timing of the work with respect to particular sites; and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the ability to recover costs from any third parties with respect to particular sites.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of any such costs being incurred or whether such costs would be material to the Company cannot be determined at this time. There can thus be no assurance that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future, or will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year, or that the Company's liquidity will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities or costs, although management believes, based on current information, that the costs to address environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. Costs related to any unknown existing or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Future occurrences\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. As a result, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws and other risks, including costs relating to the performance of cleanups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Company may incur significant capital and operating costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements, in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed unless they relate to an improvement to the property. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which are not expected to contribute to current or future operations are expensed. Operating expenses related to regulatory compliance activities for environmental matters for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $31 million (2021 - $27 million; 2020 - $25 million). For 2023, the Company expects to incur operating expenses relating to environmental matters in the same range as 2022. In addition, based on the results of its operations and maintenance programs, as well as ongoing environmental audits and other factors, the Company plans for specific capital improvements on an annual basis. Certain of these improvements help ensure facilities, such as fueling stations, waste water and storm water treatment systems, comply with environmental standards and include new construction and the updating of existing systems and/or processes. Other capital expenditures relate to assessing and remediating certain impaired properties. The Company's environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $19 million (2021 $18 million; 2020 - $20 million). For 2023, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures relating to environmental matters in the same range as 2022.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Business risks\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various business risks and uncertainties that can have an effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. While some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk management strategies, many risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be eliminated. The key areas of business risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones that can affect the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that may currently not be considered material by management, could nevertheless also have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Company faces significant competition, including from rail carriers and other modes of transportation, and is also affected by its customers' flexibility to select among various origins and destinations, including ports, in getting their products to market. Specifically, the Company faces competition from CP, which operates the other major rail system in Canada and services most of the same industrial areas, commodity resources and population centers as the Company; major U.S. railroads and other Canadian and U.S. railroads; long-distance trucking companies, transportation via the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes Seaway and the Mississippi River and transportation via pipelines. In addition, while railroads must build or acquire and maintain their rail systems, motor carriers and barges are able to use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by public entities without paying fees covering the entire costs of their usage.\n\nCompetition is generally based on the quality and the reliability of the service provided, access to markets, as well as price. Factors affecting the competitive position of customers, including exchange rates and energy cost, could materially adversely affect the demand for goods supplied by the sources served by the Company and, therefore, the Company's volumes, revenues and profit margins. Factors affecting the general market conditions for the Company's customers can result in an imbalance of transportation capacity relative to demand. An extended period of supply/demand imbalance could negatively impact market rate levels for all transportation services, and more specifically the Company's ability to maintain or increase rates. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations or financial position.\n\nPrevious consolidation of rail systems in the U.S. have resulted in larger rail systems that are in a position to compete effectively with the Company in numerous markets.\n\n## CP-KCS merger agreement\n\nOn February 28, 2022, CN filed a responsive application with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) requesting the STB to condition any approval of a CP-KCS merger on the divestiture of the KCS line from Kansas City, Missouri to Springfield and East St. Louis, Illinois (the \"Kansas City Speedway') to CN, pursuant to the STB's statutory authority to order 'the divestiture of parallel tracks' as a merger condition. Granting CN control of the line will provide customers with a new competitive option to move goods across a key North American economic corridor. On March 16, 2022, the STB suspended the procedural schedule until further notice in order for Applicants to explain an 'apparent inconsistency' in baseline 2019 tonnage data presented by the Applicants. On April 27, 2022, the STB required Applicants to amend their operating plan and required parties to submit amended comments and responsive applications. On May 27, 2022, the STB issued a revised procedural schedule. On June 9, 2022, the Company submitted comments on Applicants' amended operating plan, and the Company submitted an amended operating plan in support of the divestiture of the Kansas City Speedway. On July 1, 2022, the STB accepted the Company's responsive application for consideration and consolidated the Company's divestiture request with the primary application. On July 12, 2022, the Company submitted reply comments, and parties of record submitted reply comments to the Company's proposed divestiture of the Kansas City Speedway. On July 22, 2022, the STB scheduled a three-day hearing for September 28 to 30, 2022. On August 11, 2022, the Company filed its rebuttal in support of its responsive application. The STB held a seven-day hearing between September 28 and October 7, 2022. The Company filed Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the CP-KCS merger on October 14, 2022. The Company filed its final brief on October 21, 2022. In response to questions from the STB at the hearing, the Company included an alternative trackage rights proposal to divestiture to remedy the competitive harm from parallel tracks between Kansas City and Chicago in the CP-KCS merger. On January 27, 2023, the STB Office of Environmental Analysis issued a Final EIS for the proposed CP-KCS merger, which will be considered in the STB's decision whether to approve the merger. The STB's decision on whether to approve the merger has not yet been issued.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively against current or future competitors in the transportation industry, or that further consolidation within the transportation industry, including consolidation arising from the CP-KCS merger, if approved, and legislation allowing for more leniency in size and weight for motor carriers will not adversely affect the Company's competitive position. No assurance can be given that competitive pressures in transportation markets will not lead to reduced revenues, profit margins or both.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, hazardous substances and other materials; decommissioning of underground and aboveground storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations. As a result, the Company incurs significant operating and capital costs, on an ongoing basis, associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property.\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters in the next several years based on known information, the discovery of new facts, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs.\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. In addition, the Company is also exposed to potential catastrophic liability risk, faced by the railroad industry in general, in connection with the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, or other dangerous commodities such as crude oil and propane that the Company may be required to transport as a result of its common carrier obligations. Therefore, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws or other risks, including costs relating to the performance of clean-ups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\nThe environmental liability for any given contaminated site varies depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As such, the ultimate cost of addressing known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established. Also, additional contaminated sites yet unknown may be discovered or future operations may result in accidental releases.\n\nWhile some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk mitigation strategies (including periodic audits, employee training programs, emergency plans and procedures, and insurance), many environmental risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, there can be no assurance, notwithstanding the Company's mitigation strategies, that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, or reputation.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages, including actions brought on behalf of various purported classes of claimants and claims relating to employee and third-party personal injuries, occupational disease, and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents. The Company maintains provisions for such items, which it considers to be adequate for all of its outstanding or pending claims and benefits from insurance coverage for occurrences in excess of certain amounts. The final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2022, or with respect to future claims, cannot be predicted with certainty, and therefore there can be no assurance that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, in a particular quarter or fiscal year.\n\n## Labor negotiations\n\nThe working conditions of the Company's unionized workforce are governed by collective agreements which are negotiated from time to time. Disputes relating to the renewal of collective agreements could potentially result in strikes, lockouts, slowdown of the business and ultimately loss of business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to renew and have its collective agreements ratified without a strike or lockout or that the resolution of these negotiations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results or financial position. Future labor agreements could increase labor and fringe benefits and related expenses.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Canadian workforce\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Company served notice to commence bargaining for the renewal of the collective agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) governing approximately 700 signals and communications workers, which expired on December 31, 2021. After six months of bargaining, the IBEW served notice of dispute with the Minister of Labour which commences the conciliation/ mediation process under the Canada Labour Code. On June 15, 2022, the IBEW gave a 72-hour notice of its intention to strike and on June 18, 2022 the IBEW commenced their strike. On July 4, 2022, the IBEW agreed to binding arbitration, bringing the strike to an end. On October 7, 2022, the arbitrator rendered a decision dated October 12, 2022 awarding a three percent wage increase per year from 2022 through 2024. This decision finalizes the collective agreement between CN and the IBEW, which expires on December 31, 2024.\n\nOn December 1, 2021, CN filed an application with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) pursuant to Section 18.1 of the Canada Labour Code to review the current bargaining unit structure applicable to running trades on its Canadian railway. There are currently 12 bargaining units and 16 collective agreements covering Locomotive Engineers and Conductors. CN believes that this structure is no longer appropriate for labor relations. A consolidated unit of Locomotive Engineers and Conductors governed by one collective agreement will address these issues and would be a more appropriate bargaining unit structure. On March 23, 2022, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) served notice to commence bargaining for the renewal of the Conductor and Yard Coordinator collective agreement governing approximately 3,000 employees, which expired on July 22, 2022. In April 2022, CN filed a formal request with the CIRB requesting that the expiry date of the collective agreement be extended until the CIRB has rendered a decision on our application to conduct a bargaining unit review. On September 8, 2022, with the assistance of the CIRB as arbitrators, CN and the TCRC reached an agreement to consolidate 15 of the 16 collective bargaining agreements into one single agreement, and the CIRB issued a bargaining unit for the remaining single agreement on September 12, 2022. On September 29, 2022, the CIRB ruled that the sixteenth agreement, represented by Unifor, would be consolidated with the other Transportation agreements into one single agreement, one bargaining unit. Collective bargaining with the TCRC on the single agreement will commence on January 30, 2023.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, a tentative agreement was reached between CN and TCRC for Rail Traffic Controllers for the renewal of their collective agreement. This agreement was ratified on December 23, 2022. This is a three-year agreement expiring on December 31, 2025 and impacts approximately 160 employees.\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Unifor filed a Notice of Dispute with the Minister of Labour in the ongoing collective bargaining negotiations with CN, which impact the Clerical, Shopcraft and Intermodal groups. On December 30, 2022, the Minister of Labour appointed conciliators. Either party could potentially be in a position of a labor disruption (strike or lock-out) as early as March 21, 2023.\n\n## U.S. workforce\n\nAs of January 31, 2023, collective agreements covering all non-operating and operating craft employees at Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company (GTW), companies owned by Illinois Central Corporation (ICC), companies owned by Wisconsin Central Ltd. (WC) and Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Company (BLE), and all employees at Pittsburgh and Conneaut Dock Company (PCD) were ratified and remain in place. The agreements in place have various moratorium provisions, which preserve the status quo with respect to the given collective agreement during the terms of such moratoriums. Where negotiations are ongoing, the terms and conditions of existing agreements generally continue to apply until new agreements are reached or the processes of the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.\n\nThe general approach to labor negotiations by U.S. Class I railroads is to bargain on a collective national basis with the industry, which GTW, ICC, WC and BLE currently participate in, for collective bargaining agreements covering all union-represented employees, with the exception of two employee groups working at PCD covering in total fewer than 35 employees. The national bargaining has concluded in the United States. On December 2, 2022, the round of national bargaining between the nation's freight railroads (including the Company) and all 12 rail unions was fully resolved when President Biden signed legislation passed by Congress. The legislation implemented collective bargaining agreement terms for the four unions that had not previously ratified their agreements. These agreement terms are the same terms that previously were ratified and implemented by the other eight rail unions. All US employees in the bargaining round are therefore now covered by new collective bargaining agreement terms based on the recommendations of Presidential Emergency Board 250. The new terms increase wages by a compounded 24 percent over the five-year term of the contract, from 2020 through 2024, with a 14.1 percent wage increase effective immediately. The agreements also include five US$1,000 annual lump sum payments, adjustments to health care premiums, health benefit enhancements, and an additional personal leave day for all employees. This resulted in an incremental wage accrual of $47 million, or $35 million after-tax ($0.05 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter of 2022 in Labor and fringe benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Income, to reflect the terms of the new agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

It also regulates the maximum revenue entitlement for the movement of regulated grain, charges for railway ancillary services and noise-related disputes. In addition, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval, with attendant risks and uncertainties, and the Company is subject to government oversight with respect to rate, service and business practice issues.\n\nNo assurance can be given that any current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the Canadian federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Economic regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the STB. The STB serves as both an adjudicatory and regulatory body and has jurisdiction over certain railroad rate and service issues and rail restructuring transactions such as mergers, line sales, line construction and line abandonments. As such, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval and aspects of its pricing and service practices may be subject to challenge, with attendant risks and uncertainties. Recent proposals in proceedings undertaken by the STB in a number of significant matters remain pending.\n\nOn March 15 and 16, 2022, the STB held a public hearing concerning a proposal by the STB in 2016 to amend its regulations regarding reciprocal switching. In addition to participating in the hearing, the Company, the Association of American Railroads, and other railroads submitted written testimony and post-hearing comments in February and April 2022. The STB members conducted additional meetings with stakeholders.\n\nOn April 22, 2022, the STB proposed to revise its existing service emergency rules for rail shippers seeking a directed service order during a service emergency and propose accelerated process for acute service emergencies. Comments were submitted in May and June 2022.\n\nOn April 26 and 27, 2022, the STB held a hearing on \"Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service\". The STB required four Class I railroads to attend and invited three other Class I railroads, including the Company, to attend. On May 6, 2022, the STB required all Class I railroads to submit additional weekly service data and additional monthly employment data for six months. The STB also required certain Class I railroads to submit service recovery plans, but the Company is not required to do so. On October 28, 2022, the STB extended the data reporting for weekly service data and monthly employment data for another six months for all Class I railroads until May 5, 2023.\n\nOn August 8, 2019, the STB issued interim findings and guidance to National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and the Company regarding the terms and conditions for Amtrak's use of the Company's lines. On March 3, 2022, the STB issued a schedule for Amtrak and the Company to submit opening, reply, and rebuttal submissions on the remaining issues in the case. Opening and reply submissions were submitted in May and July 2022, and rebuttal submissions were submitted in August 2022.\n\nOn December 19, 2022, the STB issued final decisions in two proceedings relating to small rate disputes (Final Offer Rate Review and Voluntary Arbitration Program). On December 27, 2022, Union Pacific Railroad Company appealed the Final Offer Rate Review rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and the Association of American Railroads has also subsequently filed an appeal. On December 29, 2022, the Company appealed the Voluntary Arbitration Program rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and CSX also filed an appeal. On the same date, four railroads, including the Company, asked the STB to stay its deadline for Class I railroads to opt-in to the Voluntary Arbitration Program while any appeal and any petition for reconsideration is decided. On January 24, 2023, the STB denied without prejudice the request for stay and have allowed the railroads to refile a stay request on February 3, 2023. On January 24, 2023, petitions for reconsideration were filed by three other Class I railroads.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the U.S. federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Economic regulation - International\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is in the process of finalizing its Pillar Two guidelines on some key components of global tax reform which includes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. These guidelines are currently being proposed to be effective in 2024 and must now be enacted by the OECD member countries. It is possible that these guidelines, including the global minimum corporate tax rate measure of 15%, could impact the Company's effective tax rate. However, the Company is unable to predict at this time when and how this measure will be enacted into law and its impact on the Company and is currently monitoring developments in this area.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by international organizations and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n|",

The Company may be required to transport toxic inhalation hazard materials as a result of its common carrier obligations and, as such, is also subject to additional regulatory oversight in Canada. The Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act , also administered by Transport Canada, establishes the safety requirements for the transportation of goods classified as dangerous and enables the adoption of regulations for security training and screening of personnel working with dangerous goods, as well as the development of a program to require a transportation security clearance for dangerous goods, the tracking of dangerous goods during transport and the development of an emergency response plan.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, the Minister issued two orders respecting railway uncontrolled movements. The first order imposes special interim procedures aimed at reducing the risks of uncontrolled movements. The second order requires the Canadian railway industry to revise existing rules to incorporate design and performance parameters for locomotives with roll-away protection, to develop a precise definition of attended versus unattended equipment as well as incorporate requirements on the use of roll-away protection to reduce the risks of an uncontrolled movement. In accordance with the second order, the Railway Association of Canada filed the requested revisions on March 10, 2022. The Minister approved the revised rules on May 9, 2022 and they came into force on October 1, 2022.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, the Minister approved the new Duty and Rest Period Rules for Operating Employees (the \"Rules\") subject to conditions clarifying some aspects of the Rules. In accordance with the new Rules, CN filed with Transport Canada on November 25, 2021, its Fatigue Management Plan containing an extensive set of prescriptive requirements for processes around scheduling, fitness for duty, deadheading, and other requirements of the new rules. On March 11, 2022, Transport Canada opened pre-consultations on proposed Fatigue Management System Regulations. On November 25, 2022, provisions of the Rules prohibiting employees from commencing a duty period or operating railway equipment if unfit for duty came into force. The other provisions of the Rules applicable to CN will come into effect on May 25, 2023.\n\nOn July 9 and 11, 2021, Transport Canada issued orders pursuant to the Railway Safety Act in response to wildfires in British Columbia. In addition to requiring the implementation of specific measures aimed at reducing the risk of fires and improving their detection, the Order directed railway companies to complete and implement a Final Extreme Weather Fire Risk Mitigation Plan (\"Final Plan\") within 60 days following the issuance of these orders. In accordance with this requirement, CN filed its proposed Final Plan on September 9, 2021. On October 14, 2021, the Transportation Safety Board confirmed that its investigation of the Lytton fire had not revealed any evidence to link railway operations to the fire. On June 15, 2022, the Minister approved the Railway Extreme Heat and Fire Risk Mitigation Rules requiring railway companies to reduce speed and conduct additional track inspections when temperatures are high, inspect locomotive exhaust systems more frequently, and implement a fire risk reduction plan.\n\nOn November 26, 2021, Transport Canada adopted regulations revising the scope of application of the Grade Crossing Regulations by setting requirements for grade crossings according to a risk-based model. Under this model, existing crossings considered to be low risk are exempted from upgrade requirements. The amendments also extend the compliance deadline for upgrade requirements (previously November 28,  2021)  on  the  basis  of  the  risk-based  model.  For  crossings  considered  to  be  high  priority,  the  deadline  is  extended  by  one  year  (until November 28, 2022), and for all other crossings (i.e., crossings that do not meet the threshold criteria for low-risk or high priority) by three years (until November 28, 2024).\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Minister approved revisions to the Rules Respecting Track Safety which will come into force on May 31, 2023. The revisions include requirements to make available to Transport Canada railway track standards and for the confidential treatment of technical sensitive information provided by railway companies. The revisions also provide for the development of a plan for selecting, defining and analyzing key performance indicators; new requirement for crossties and new inspection requirements for Class I track where occupied passenger trains are operated.\n\nOn July 25, 2022, the Minister issued an order requesting railway companies to revise the Railway Freight and Passenger Train Brake Inspection and Safety Rules to incorporate enhanced inspection requirements for the performance of air brakes, including in cold temperatures. In accordance with these directions, the Railway Association of Canada filed proposed revisions respecting air brake train tests on November 30, 2022. Revisions respecting test standards must be filed by May 31, 2023.\n\nOn September 2, 2022, Transport Canada's Locomotive Voice and Video Recorder (LVVR) Regulations came into force. These regulations prohibit a railway company from operating railway equipment unless it is fitted with prescribed recording instruments and the prescribed information is recorded, collected and preserved. LVVR technology will assist in preventing accidents and facilitate investigations to better understand the circumstances of accidents. Supply chain disruptions have hampered the industry's ability to strictly adhere to the implementation timelines. Transport Canada acknowledges these challenges and encourages the industry to diligently equip their operating railway equipment.\n\nOn October 6, 2022, a Task Force appointed by the Minister on January 31, 2022 made recommendations regarding short and long-term actions to alleviate supply chain congestion. No formal action has been announced by the Minister on the basis of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the Minister tabled Bill C-33 in the House of Commons. The Bill is titled ' An Act to amend the Customs Act, the Railway Safety Act, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992, the Marine Transportation Security Act, the Canada Transportation Act and the Canada Marine Act and to make a consequential amendment to another Act '. Key amendments are to the Railway Safety Act which will provide the Minister the same power for security questions which he currently has to deal with safety issues.\n\nOn January 9, 2023, Transport Canada published amendments to the Transportation Information Regulations which will require Canadian railways to provide information respecting performance indicators such as transit time and dwell time. This information will be published each week. The amendments will come into force on April 4, 2023.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the Canadian federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Safety regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to safety regulation by the FRA under the Federal Railroad Safety Act as well as rail portions of other safety statutes, with the transportation of certain hazardous commodities also governed by regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA requires carriers operating in the U.S. to report annually the volume and routespecific data for cars containing these commodities; conduct a safety and security risk analysis for each used route; identify a commercially practicable alternative route for each used route; and select for use the practical route posing the least safety and security risk. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires rail carriers to provide upon request, within five minutes for a single car and 30 minutes for multiple cars, location and shipping information on cars on their networks containing toxic inhalation hazard materials and certain radioactive or explosive materials; and ensure the secure, attended transfer of all such cars to and from shippers, receivers and other carriers that will move from, to, or through designated high-threat urban areas.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, the FRA issued a final rule that requires each Class I railroad and certain shortline railroads to develop a railroad Risk Reduction Program (RRP) in a written plan that will be reviewed and approved by the FRA and will be subject to audit. CN submitted its plan on August 16, 2021. In November 2021, the FRA denied the Class I risk reduction program plans with comments. CN submitted its revised plan on February 7, 2022 and made further revisions in response to comments from the FRA on March 25, 2022. On July 7, 2022, the FRA approved the Company's RRP. On September 8, 2022, the FRA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding whether the FRA should retain or remove a provision in the final RRP rule clarifying that contractors who perform a significant portion of a railroad's operations are considered the railroad's directly affected employees for purposes of the RRP rule. The FRA is seeking comments in response to a petition for reconsideration of the final rule filed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Comments were submitted on November 7, 2022.\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the FRA implemented an emergency order governing the use of face masks in railroad operations. On April 19, 2022, the FRA announced that it will not enforce its face mask emergency order at this time in light of the court decision concerning the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) transportation mask order.\n\nThe US government previously announced that it intended to impose vaccine mandates on (1) government contractors and (2) all private sector employers with 100 or more employees. As to government contractors, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14042 called 'Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors.' The Executive Order required federal government contractors and others doing business with federal contractors to require vaccination of their employees. The contractor mandate was originally scheduled to go into effect on January 10, 2022. However, two federal appeals courts have ruled that the contractor mandate exceeded the President's authority. Additionally, two other federal appellate courts covering different states have pending cases in which the mandate is also challenged. The Biden Administration has indicated that it does not plan to enforce the mandate with these adverse rulings in place. For private sector employers, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued an emergency temporary standard (ETS) requiring employers with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccination. After a decision by the United States Supreme Court, OSHA withdrew the ETS.\n\nOn June 13, 2022, the FRA issued a final rule requiring Class I and other railroads to submit fatigue risk management program plans by July 13, 2023 to the FRA for approval. Railroads have 36 months to implement their plans after the FRA approves the plans.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the FRA proposed a rule requiring two-person crew, except in certain circumstances. The FRA held a public hearing on the proposed rule on December 14, 2022. The Association of American Railroads, the Company, and other railroads submitted comments on December 21, 2022.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the U.S. federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Regulation - Vessels\n\nThe Company's vessel operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, which regulate the ownership and operation of vessels operating on the Great Lakes and in U.S. coastal waters. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate air emissions from these vessels.\n\n## Security\n\nThe Company is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in the U.S. addressing homeland security concerns. In the U.S., safety matters related to security are overseen by the TSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and PHMSA, which, like the FRA, is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Border security falls under the jurisdiction of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is part of the DHS. In Canada, the Company is subject to regulation by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Matters related to agriculture-related shipments crossing the Canada/U.S. border also fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in Canada. More specifically, the Company is subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 border security arrangements, pursuant to an agreement the Company and CP entered into with the CBP and the CBSA;\n- \u00b7 the CBP's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program and designation as a low-risk carrier under CBSA's Customs Self-Assessment (CSA) program;\n- \u00b7 regulations imposed by the CBP requiring advance notification by all modes of transportation for all shipments into the U.S. The CBSA is also working on similar requirements for Canada-bound traffic;\n- \u00b7 inspection for imported fruits and vegetables grown in Canada and the agricultural quarantine and inspection (AQI) user fee for all traffic entering the U.S. from Canada; and\n- \u00b7 gamma ray screening of cargo entering the U.S. from Canada, and potential security and agricultural inspections at the Canada/U.S. border.\n\nThe Company has worked with the AAR to develop and put in place an extensive industry-wide security plan to address terrorism and security-driven efforts by state and local governments seeking to restrict the routings of certain hazardous materials. If such state and local routing restrictions were to go into force, they would be likely to add to security concerns by foreclosing the Company's most optimal and secure transportation routes, leading to increased yard handling, longer hauls, and the transfer of traffic to lines less suitable for moving hazardous materials, while also infringing upon the exclusive and uniform federal oversight over railroad security matters.\n\nWhile the Company will continue to work closely with the CBSA, CBP, and other Canadian and U.S. agencies, as described above, no assurance can be given that these and future decisions by the U.S., Canadian, provincial, state, or local governments on homeland security matters, legislation on security matters enacted by the U.S. Congress or Parliament, or joint decisions by the industry in response to threats to the North American rail network, will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Transportation of hazardous materials\n\nAs a result of its common carrier obligations, the Company is legally required to transport toxic inhalation hazard materials regardless of risk or potential exposure or loss. A train accident involving the transport of these commodities could result in significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental penalties and remediation in excess of insurance coverage for these risks, which may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Pandemic risk\n\nSevere disruptions in regional economies and the world economy can be caused by the outbreak of a contagious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such pandemics and efforts to contain them could result in international, national and local border closings, travel restrictions, significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains, customer activity and demand, service cancellations, reductions and other changes, significant challenges in healthcare service preparation and delivery, and quarantines, as well as considerable general concern and uncertainty, all of which could negatively affect the economic environment and may in the future have further impacts, as was the case for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not possible to predict what measures and restrictions may be imposed by governmental authorities and the period of time during which those measures and restrictions may apply. Economic and supply chain disruptions, including temporary staff shortages resulting from a pandemic, could further materially affect the Company's financial results and operations. A pandemic could also further and significantly impact freight demand and commodity prices in connection with ensuing economic disruption, supply shortages, trade disruption, temporary staff shortages and temporary closures of facilities in geographic locations more importantly impacted by the outbreak. The scope and severity of such disruptions and their impact on the Company's financial results and operations could be material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Economic conditions\n\nThe Company is susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight it transports or the supplies it requires to operate. In addition, many of the goods and commodities carried by the Company experience cyclical demand. For example, the volatility in domestic and global energy markets could impact the demand for transportation services as well as impact the Company's fuel costs and surcharges. In addition, the volatility in other commodity markets such as coal and iron ore could have an impact on volumes. Many of the bulk commodities the Company transports move offshore and are affected more by global rather than North American economic conditions. Adverse North American and global economic conditions, or economic or industrial restructuring, that affect the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by the Company, including customer insolvency, may have a material adverse effect on the volume of rail shipments and/or revenues from commodities carried by the Company, and thus materially and negatively affect its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Moreover, supply chain disruptions in North America and internationally may adversely affect volumes of goods and timelines, and therefore adversely affect CN's operations and financial results.\n\n## Pension funding volatility\n\nThe Company's funding requirements for its defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. See the section of this MD&A entitled Critical accounting estimates - Pensions and other postretirement benefits for information relating to the funding of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest rates as well as changes to existing federal pension legislation and regulation may significantly impact future pension contributions and have a material adverse effect on the funding status of the plans and the Company's results of operations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's pension expense and funding of its defined benefit pension plans will not increase in the future and thereby negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Reliance on technology and related cybersecurity risk\n\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The Company depends on the proper functioning and availability of its information technology, including communications systems and data processing systems designed to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. The Company's information technology systems are critical in meeting customer expectations, tracking, maintaining, and operating trains and related vehicles, managing employees, and interfacing with customers, suppliers, vendors, and other third parties.\n\nSecurity threats continue to grow and can come from nation states, organized criminals, hacktivists and others, and the Company is at heightened risk, due to its position as a critical component of both the Canadian and U.S. infrastructure, and may be impacted by cyber attacks or security incidents, whether accidental or malicious. While the Company has business continuity and disaster recovery plans, other security and mitigation programs in place to protect its operations, as well as information and technology assets, a cybersecurity attack, significant disruption or failure of its information technology and communications systems or those of its vendors or service providers, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay the Company's operations, result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures or other operational difficulties, damage its reputation, cause a loss of customers, vendors, suppliers, agents, or third-party capacity providers and lead to misappropriation of assets, data corruption, unauthorized system and data access or disclosures. The Company may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the services provided. A cyber incident or interruption of information technology systems could expose the Company to a risk of loss, litigation, regulatory oversight, enforcement actions or cause it to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its operational and financial position.\n\nThe Company is investing to meet evolving network and data security expectations and regulations in an effort to mitigate the impact a security incident might have on the Company, including its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The final outcome of a potential security incident, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, there can be no assurance that its resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, goodwill, results of operations, financial position or liquidity, in any particular quarter or fiscal year.\n\nNew regulatory obligations related to cybersecurity and technology risk may impose additional costs and obligations on the Company and may lead to government inquiries or requests for information. This includes, but is not limited to, Security Directives from the DHS and TSA requiring rail operators to take several actions in 2022 and in 2023 to enhance rail cybersecurity.\n\nOn October 18, 2022, the TSA issued the second Security Directive titled Rail Cybersecurity Mitigation Actions that applies to Class I railroads effective October 24, 2022. This security directive applies to critical cyber systems, which if compromised could result in an operational disruption, and requires railroads to submit a cybersecurity implementation plan by February 21, 2023 to the TSA for approval and develop a cybersecurity assessment program plan, which must be updated annually.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, TSA also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for enhancing surface cyber risk management to seek input on ways to strengthen cybersecurity and resiliency in the rail sectors.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 , the DHS Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is developing mandatory cyber incident reporting requirements for U.S. critical infrastructure which includes the transportation sector and Class I railroads.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the plans, programs, and assets the Company has in place to prevent or mitigate the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur.\n\n## Trade restrictions\n\nGlobal as well as North American trade conditions, including trade barriers on certain commodities, may interfere with the free circulation of goods across Canada and the U.S. or the cost associated therewith.\n\nOn November 24, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued the final results of its second administrative review of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders regarding softwood lumber products from Canada, by applying a 17.9% combined duty rate, approximately twice the current combined duty rate of 8.99%. Following completion of any legal challenges under the CUSMA or USMCA Chapter 10 or in U.S. courts, these new duty rates will apply retroactively. The Government of Canada has stated that it still believes this is entirely unjustified and will hurt consumers, businesses and workers on both sides of the border. The decision will be challenged while a negotiated solution to this longstanding trade issue is pursued.\n\nIt remains too early to assess the potential outcome of other ongoing various trade actions taken by governments and agencies. As such, there can be no assurance that trade actions will not materially adversely affect the volume of rail shipments and/or revenues from commodities carried by the Company, and thus materially and negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Terrorism and international conflicts\n\nPotential terrorist actions can have a direct or indirect impact on the transportation infrastructure, including railway infrastructure in North America, and can interfere with the free flow of goods. Rail lines, facilities and equipment could be directly targeted or become indirect casualties, which could interfere with the free flow of goods. International conflicts can also have an impact on the Company's markets. Government response to such events could adversely affect the Company's operations. Insurance premiums could also increase significantly or coverage could become unavailable.\n\n## Customer credit risk\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers and reviews the credit history of each new customer. Although the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to the business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and/or business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nDisruptions in financial markets or deterioration of the Company's credit ratings could hinder the Company's access to external sources of funding to meet its liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that changes in the financial markets will not have a negative effect on the Company's liquidity and its access to capital at acceptable terms and rates.\n\n## Supplier concentration\n\nThe Company operates in a capital-intensive industry where the complexity of rail equipment limits the number of suppliers available. The supply market could be disrupted if changes in the economy caused any of the Company's suppliers to cease production or to experience capacity or supply shortages. The supply market could become further concentrated and could result in changes to the product or service offerings by suppliers. This could also result in cost increases to the Company and difficulty in obtaining and maintaining the Company's rail equipment and materials. Since the Company also has foreign suppliers, international relations, trade restrictions and global economic and other conditions may potentially interfere with the Company's ability to procure necessary equipment and materials. Widespread business failures of, or restrictions on suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Availability of qualified personnel\n\nThe Company may experience demographic challenges in the employment levels of its workforce. Changes in employee demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly locomotive engineers and conductors and information technologists, could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet demand for rail service. The Company monitors employment levels and seeks to ensure that there is an adequate supply of personnel to meet rail service requirements. However, the Company's efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel may be hindered by specific conditions in the job market. No assurance can be given that demographic or other challenges will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its financial position.\n\n## Fuel costs and supply disruptions\n\nThe Company is susceptible to the volatility of fuel prices due to changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Rapid rises in fuel prices, such as those experienced in 2022, or fuel supply disruptions can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, climate, as well as labor and political instability such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Increases in fuel prices or supply disruptions may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the US dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and thereby may adversely affect the Company's revenues and expenses.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk relating to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense. Adverse changes to market interest rates may significantly impact the fair value or future cash flows of the Company's financial instruments. There can be no assurance that changes in the market interest rates will not have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.\n\n## Transportation network disruptions\n\nDue to the integrated nature of the North American freight transportation infrastructure, the Company's operations may be negatively affected by service disruptions of its own network, including illegal blockades, as well as of other transportation links such as ports and other railroads which interchange with the Company. A significant prolonged service disruption of CN's network or one or more of these entities could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Furthermore, deterioration in the cooperative relationships with the Company's connecting carriers could directly affect the Company's operations.\n\n## Severe weather\n\nThe Company's success is dependent on its ability to operate its railroad efficiently. Severe weather and natural disasters, such as extreme cold or heat, flooding, droughts, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, can disrupt operations and service for the railroad, affect the performance of locomotives and rolling stock, as well as disrupt operations for both the Company and its customers. Business interruptions resulting from severe weather could result in increased costs, increased liabilities and lower revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change has the potential physical risks of increasing the frequency of adverse weather events, which can disrupt the Company's operations and damage its infrastructure or properties. It could also affect the markets for, or the volume of, the goods the Company carries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Government action or inaction to address climate change could also affect CN. The Company is currently subject to climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations that have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, at the federal, provincial and state levels. While CN is continually focused on efficiency improvements and reducing its carbon footprint, cap and trade systems, carbon taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases imposed by various government bodies could increase the Company's capital and operating costs. An escalating price on carbon emissions could materially increase direct costs related to fuel purchases and indirect expenses related to purchased goods, materials, and electricity required to operate our business. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns. The Company may not be able to offset such impacts through, for example, higher freight rates. Climate change legislation and regulation could also affect CN's customers; make it difficult for CN's customers to produce products in a cost-competitive manner due to increased energy costs; and increase legal costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022, have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, and issued Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting dated January 31, 2023 to that effect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated January 31, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical audit matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Evaluation of income taxes\n\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the net deferred income tax liability was $9,796 million as of December 31, 2022 and income tax expense was $1,645 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company operates in different tax jurisdictions which requires the Company to make significant judgments and estimates in relation to its tax positions.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the net deferred income tax liability and income tax expense as a critical audit matter due to the magnitude of these tax balances and complexities in the evaluation of the application of the relevant tax regulations applicable to the Company. A high degree of auditor judgment was required in assessing certain of the Company's tax positions and balances.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's reconciliation and analysis of its deferred income tax balances. We involved income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: (1) assessing the Company's interpretation of the relevant tax regulations; (2) evaluating the reasonability of the Company's tax positions; and (3) analyzing the Company's deferred income tax balances by comparing prior year tax estimates to actual tax returns filed, and evaluating the Company's reconciliation of the deferred income tax balances to the underlying temporary differences.\n\n\u00a9 2022 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, expenditures related to self-constructed properties include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of capitalization of costs relating to track and railway infrastructure as a critical audit matter. The magnitude and complexities in self-constructed properties, as well as the judgments involved in determining whether the expenditure met the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria required subjective auditor judgment.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's capital additions process, including controls related to the monitoring of budget versus actual costs on capital projects and the Company's assessment that the expenditures charged to projects meet the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria. For a sample of capital expenditure additions, we examined underlying documentation and assessed whether the expenditure met the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria. The testing was performed at a disaggregated level by type of cost (including direct material, labor, and contracted services), and for rail, included comparisons to prior period per unit measures by region. In addition, we examined the Company's budget versus actual analysis on capital projects and assessed the Company's explanations of differences exceeding pre-determined testing thresholds.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditors since 1992.\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada January\u00a031, 2023\n\n|",

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada January 31, 2023\n\n\u00a9 2022 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCanadian National Railway Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively \"CN\" or the \"Company\", is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.), connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's freight revenues are derived from the movement of a diversified and balanced portfolio of goods, including petroleum and chemicals, grain and fertilizers, coal, metals and minerals, forest products, intermodal and automotive.\n\n## 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise indicated, and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the Employee Benefit Plan Trusts (\"Share Trusts\") as the Company has the direct ability to make decisions regarding the Share Trusts' principal activities. The Company's investments in which it has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method and all other investments for which fair value is not readily determinable are accounted for at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to goodwill, intangible assets, identified assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, income taxes, depreciation, pensions and other postretirement benefits, personal injury and other claims, and environmental matters, based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Nature of services\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of freight revenues and other revenues. Freight revenues include revenue from the movement of freight over rail and are derived from the following seven commodity groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Petroleum and chemicals, which includes chemicals and plastics, refined petroleum products, crude and condensate, and sulfur;\n- \u00b7 Metals and minerals, which includes energy materials, metals, minerals, and iron ore;\n- \u00b7 Forest products, which includes lumber, pulp, paper, and panels;\n- \u00b7 Coal, which includes coal and petroleum coke;\n- \u00b7 Grain and fertilizers, which includes Canadian regulated grain, Canadian commercial grain, U.S. grain, potash and other fertilizers;\n- \u00b7 Intermodal, which includes rail and trucking services for domestic and international traffic; and\n- \u00b7 Automotive, which includes finished vehicles and auto parts.\n\nFreight revenues also comprise revenues for optional services beyond the basic movement of freight including asset use, switching, storage, and other services.\n\nOther revenues are derived from non-rail logistics services that support the Company's rail business including vessels and docks, transloading and distribution, automotive logistics, and freight forwarding and transportation management.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services.\n\nThe Company accounts for contracts with customers when it has approval and commitment from both parties, each party's rights have been identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collection is probable. For contracts that involve multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations in the contract are satisfied.\n\nRevenues are presented net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Freight revenues\n\nFreight services are arranged through publicly-available tariffs or customer-specific agreements that establish the pricing, terms and conditions for freight services offered by the Company. For revenue recognition purposes, a contract for the movement of freight over rail exists when shipping instructions are sent by a customer and have been accepted by the Company in connection with the relevant tariff or customerspecific agreement.\n\nRevenues for the movement of freight over rail are recognized over time due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer as freight moves from origin to destination. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation is measured based on the transit time of freight from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between periods is based on the relative transit time in each period with expenses recorded as incurred. Revenues related to freight contracts that require the involvement of another rail carrier to move freight from origin to destination are reported on a net basis. Freight movements are completed over a short period of time and are generally completed before payment is due. Freight receivables are included in Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has no material contract assets associated with freight revenues.\n\nContract liabilities represent consideration received from customers for which the related performance obligation has not been satisfied. Contract liabilities are recognized into revenues when or as the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company includes contract liabilities within Accounts payable and other and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRevenues for optional services are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\nFreight contracts may be subject to variable consideration in the form of volume-based incentives, rebates, or other items, which affect the transaction price. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is accrued on the basis of management's best estimate of the expected amount, which is based on available historical, current and forecasted information.\n\n## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding excludes shares held in the Share Trusts and includes vested equity settled stock-based compensation awards other than stock options. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period, applying the treasury stock method. The weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding includes the dilutive effects of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and nonvested equity settled awards.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nAll of the Company's foreign subsidiaries use the US dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, the foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. All adjustments resulting from the translation of the foreign operations are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nThe Company designates the US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign exchange gains and losses, from the dates of designation, on the translation of the US dollardenominated debt are included in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n|",

Restricted cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at cost net of billing adjustments and an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. When a receivable is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to bad debt expense in Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Material and supplies\n\nMaterial and supplies, which consist mainly of rail, ties, and other items for construction and maintenance of property and equipment, as well as diesel fuel, are measured at weighted-average cost.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nAssets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less expected selling costs ('estimated selling price') with a loss recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated selling price. The classification is applicable at the date upon which the sale of assets is probable, and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition. The transfer of the assets must also be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within the year following the date of classification.\n\nAssets once classified as held for sale, are not subject to depreciation or amortization and both the assets and any liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale are classified as current in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nSubsequent changes to the estimated selling price of assets held for sale are recorded as recoveries or losses to the Consolidated Statements of Income wherein the recognition of subsequent gains is limited to the cumulative loss previously recognized.\n\n## Properties\n\n## Capitalization of costs\n\nThe Company's railroad operations are highly capital intensive. The Company's properties mainly consist of homogeneous or network-type assets such as rail, ties, ballast and other structures, which form the Company's Track and roadway properties, and Rolling stock. The Company's capital expenditures are for the replacement of existing assets and for the purchase or construction of new assets to enhance operations or provide new service offerings to customers. A large portion of the Company's capital expenditures are for self-constructed properties, including the replacement of existing track and roadway assets and track line expansion, as well as major overhauls and large refurbishments of rolling stock.\n\nExpenditures are capitalized if they extend the life of the asset or provide future benefits such as increased revenue-generating capacity, functionality or service capacity. The Company has a process in place to determine whether or not costs qualify for capitalization, which requires judgment. For Track and roadway properties, the Company establishes basic capital programs to replace or upgrade the track infrastructure assets which are capitalized if they meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nIn addition, for Track and roadway properties, expenditures that meet the minimum level of activity as defined by the Company are also capitalized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 grading : installation of road bed, retaining walls, and drainage structures;\n- \u00b7 rail and related track material : installation of 39 or more continuous feet of rail;\n- \u00b7 ties : installation of five or more ties per 39 feet; and\n- \u00b7 ballast : installation of 171 cubic yards of ballast per mile.\n\nFor purchased assets, the Company capitalizes all costs necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use. For self-constructed properties, expenditures include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs. These allocated costs include, but are not limited to, project supervision, fringe benefits, maintenance on equipment used on projects as well as the cost of small tools and supplies. The Company reviews and adjusts its allocations, as required, to reflect the actual costs incurred each year.\n\nFor the rail asset, the Company capitalizes the costs of rail grinding which consists of restoring and improving the rail profile and removing irregularities from worn rail to extend the service life. The service life of the rail asset is increased incrementally as rail grinding is performed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

When ballast is installed as part of a shoulder ballast undercutting project, it represents the addition of a new asset and not the repair or maintenance of an existing asset. As such, the Company capitalizes expenditures related to shoulder ballast undercutting given that an existing asset is retired and replaced with a new asset. Under the group method of accounting for properties, the deteriorated ballast is retired at its historical cost.\n\nCosts of deconstruction and removal of replaced assets, referred to herein as dismantling costs, are distinguished from installation costs for self-constructed properties based on the nature of the related activity. For Track and roadway properties, employees concurrently perform dismantling and installation of new track and roadway assets and, as such, the Company estimates the amount of labor and other costs that are related to dismantling. The Company determines dismantling costs based on an analysis of the track and roadway installation process.\n\nExpenditures relating to the Company's properties that do not meet the Company's capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred. For Track and roadway properties, such expenditures include but are not limited to spot tie replacement, spot or broken rail replacement, physical track inspection for detection of rail defects and minor track corrections, and other general maintenance of track infrastructure.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years, except for rail and ballast whose service lives are measured in millions of gross tons. The Company follows the group method of depreciation whereby a single composite depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a class of similar assets, despite small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\nFor all depreciable asset classes, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated service lives of properties requires judgment and is based on currently available information, including periodic depreciation studies conducted by the Company. The Company's United States (U.S.) properties are subject to comprehensive depreciation studies as required by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe service life of the rail asset is based on expected future usage of the rail in its existing condition, determined using railroad industry research and testing (based on rail characteristics such as weight, curvature and metallurgy), factoring in the rail asset's usage to date. The annual composite depreciation rate for the rail asset is determined by dividing the estimated annual number of gross tons carried over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in millions of gross tons. The Company amortizes the cost of rail grinding over the remaining life of the rail asset, which includes the incremental life extension generated by rail grinding.\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost is removed from the asset account and the difference between its estimated historical cost and estimated related accumulated depreciation (net of salvage proceeds and dismantling costs), if any, is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The estimated historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, firstout approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company engages in short and long-term leases for rolling stock including locomotives and freight cars, equipment, real estate and service contracts that contain embedded leases. The Company determines whether or not a contract contains a lease at inception. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded by the Company on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFinance and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Where the implicit interest rate is not determinable from the lease, the Company uses internal incremental borrowing rates by tenor and currency to initially measure leases in excess of twelve months on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company's lease contracts may contain termination, renewal, and/or purchase options, residual value guarantees, or a combination thereof, all of which are evaluated by the Company on a quarterly basis. The majority of renewal options available extend the lease term from one to five years. The Company accounts for such contract options when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise one of these options.\n\nLease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components that the Company generally accounts for separately, with the exception of the freight car asset category for which the Company has elected to not separate the lease and non-lease components.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets consist mainly of customer contracts and relationships acquired through business acquisitions. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, ranging from 20 to 50 years. If a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is determined, amortization is adjusted prospectively.\n\nWith respect to impairment, the Company tests the recoverability of its intangible assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, based on future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.\n\nWith respect to impairment, the Company may first assess certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and events such as changes in management or customers. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, and an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, up to the value of goodwill. The Company defines the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the impairment date. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method using the pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or group of assets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization\n\nBased on the structure of its accounts receivable securitization program, the Company accounts for the proceeds received as secured borrowings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Pensions\n\nPension costs are determined using actuarial methods. Net periodic benefit cost (income) includes the current service cost of pension benefits provided in exchange for employee service rendered during the year, which is recorded in Labor and fringe benefits expense. Net periodic benefit cost (income) also includes the following, which are recorded in Other components of net periodic benefit income (cost):\n\n- \u00b7 the interest cost of pension obligations;\n- \u00b7 the expected long-term return on pension fund assets;\n- \u00b7 the amortization of prior service costs and amendments over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans;\n- \u00b7 the Company uses a market related value to calculate net periodic benefit cost (income) (see Note 2 -Change in accounting policy ) and\n- \u00b7 the amortization of cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the beginning of year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans.\n\nThe pension plans are funded through contributions determined in accordance with the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.\n\n## Postretirement benefits other than pensions\n\nThe Company accrues the cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions using actuarial methods. These benefits, which are funded as they become due, include life insurance programs, medical benefits and, for a closed group of employees, free rail travel benefits.\n\nThe Company amortizes the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plan.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the stock-based compensation expense on equity settled awards and other items relating to equity settled awards. Upon the exercise of stock options, the stock-based compensation expense related to those awards is reclassified from Additional paid-in capital to Common shares. Upon settlement of all other equity settled awards, the Company reclassifies from Additional paid-in capital to Retained Earnings the stock-based compensation expense and other items related to equity settled awards, up to the amount of the settlement cost. The excess, if any, of the settlement cost over the stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Retained Earnings.\n\n## Stock-based compensation\n\nFor equity settled awards, stock-based compensation costs are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date. The grant date fair value of performance share unit (PSU) awards is dependent on the type of PSU award. The grant date fair value of PSU-ROIC awards is determined using a lattice-based model incorporating a minimum share price condition and the grant date fair value of PSU-TSR awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant date fair value of equity settled deferred share unit (DSU) awards is determined using the stock price at the grant date. The grant date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For cash settled awards, stock-based compensation costs are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value determined at each period-end. The fair value of cash settled DSU awards is determined using their intrinsic value.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn Canada, the Company accounts for costs related to employee work-related injuries based on actuarially developed estimates on a discounted basis of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. In the U.S., the Company accrues the expected cost for personal injury, property damage and occupational disease claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost on an undiscounted basis. For all other legal actions in Canada and the U.S., the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\n## Environmental expenditures\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations, or to an existing condition caused by past operations, are expensed as incurred. Environmental expenditures that provide a future benefit are capitalized. Environmental liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective shares of the liability. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated or not qualified as a hedge are recorded in Net income in the current period.\n\n## 2 - Change in accounting policy\n\n## Change in accounting policy for determining net periodic pension cost (income)\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, CN elected to change its accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The new accounting method changes the calculation of market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost but has no impact on the annual funded status of the plans. The Company's previous methodology calculated market-related value for pensions whereby realized and unrealized gains/losses and appreciation/depreciation in the value of the investments were recognized over a period of five years. The Company's new methodology will apply a corridor approach so that the marketrelated value does not result in a value that deviates excessively from its fair value. Specifically, the market-related value will not exceed 110% or be less than 90% of the fair value. This change establishes a corridor approach whereby the amount causing the market-related value to be outside of the 10% corridor will be recognized immediately in the market-related value of assets and will not be subject to the five-year period of recognition. There is no change in the recognition approach for investment income.\n\nCN considers the use of a calculated value with a corridor approach preferable to the previous calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. The new accounting method to calculate the market-related value for pensions also aligns with the prevailing guidance issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) for the preparation of actuarial valuations for funding purposes for all registered Canadian defined benefit pension plans, whereby the Company adopted and applied the updated OSFI guidance starting with the December 31, 2021 funding valuations that were filed during the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe change in accounting method was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within CN's financial statements. The change did not impact Operating income or Net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of Other components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for defined benefit pension plans along with related consolidated income items such as Net income and Earnings per share. Other impacts included related changes to previously reported consolidated Other comprehensive income (loss), Retained earnings, Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and associated line items within the determination of Net cash provided (used) by operating activities.\n\nThe election of this change impacted previously reported amounts included herein as indicated in the tables below:\n\n## Consolidated Statements of Income\n\n|                                                 | Year ended December 31, 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2020   | Year ended December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| In millions, except per share data              | Under prior method             |                                | As restated                    | Under prior method             | As restated                    |\n| Other components of net periodic benefit income | $                              | 398                            | $  407                         | $  315                         | $  292                         |\n| Income before income taxes                      | $                              | 6,333                          | $  6,342                       | $  4,544                       | $  4,521                       |\n| Income tax expense                              | $                              | (1,441)                        | $  (1,443)                     | $  (982)                       | $  (976)                       |\n| Net income                                      | $                              | 4,892                          | $  4,899                       | $  3,562                       | $  3,545                       |\n| Earnings per share:                             |                                |                                |                                |                                |                                |\n| Basic                                           | $                              | 6.90                           | $  6.91                        | $  5.01                        | $  4.98                        |\n| Diluted                                         | $                              | 6.89                           | $  6.90                        | $  5.00                        | $  4.97                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The adoption of this standard has been applied to existing government assistance transactions. See Note 12 - Properties for additional information.\n\nThe following recent ASUs issued by the FASB were issued in 2020, were amended in 2021 as well as in 2022 and have not been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06 Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and related amendments\n\nUSD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) are benchmark interest rates referenced in a variety of agreements. The publication of certain LIBOR and CDOR rates were discontinued in January 2022 and May 2021, respectively, and the remaining rates are expected to be discontinued on June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The recommended alternative reference rates for LIBOR and CDOR are the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), respectively.\n\nThe ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity.\n\nThe ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2024, following the amendments of ASU 2022-06. The Company has a non-revolving credit facility that references LIBOR and CDOR for which the alternative reference rate is expected to be SOFR and CORRA, respectively. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facility referencing LIBOR with outstanding borrowings of US$542 million (see Note 16 -Debt ). The equipment loans will be impacted by the discontinuance of the remaining LIBOR rates and the Company has fallback language that allows for the succession of LIBOR to SOFR.\n\nThe Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, and whether it will elect to apply any of the optional expedients and exceptions provided in the ASU.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2022 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

On September 15, 2021, KCS and its Board of Directors announced that the revised acquisition proposal of September 12, 2021 from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP) constituted a \"Company Superior Proposal\" as defined in the CN Merger Agreement. Consequently, KCS entered into a waiver letter agreement with CN under which KCS agreed to terminate the CN Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with CP. As a result, CN received from KCS a merger termination fee of US$700 million ($886 million), recorded in Merger termination fee within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, KCS also refunded Brooklyn US Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdco\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, US$700 million ($886 million) that CN had previously paid as an advance to KCS of US$700 million ($845 million) in connection with KCS's payment of the termination fee to CP under KCS's original merger agreement with CP that was terminated on May 21, 2021. The refund received in the third quarter of 2021 was recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows. The US$700 million ($845 million) advance was recorded in Advance to KCS and other transaction costs within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the second quarter of 2021 and was expensed to Transactionrelated costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2021. This advance, along with $63 million of transactionrelated costs paid in the second quarter of 2021, was reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows.\n\nThe Company incurred $84 million of transaction-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income. This included $125 million of transaction-related costs, consisting of a $76 million expense for costs previously capitalized to Advance to KCS and other transaction costs within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the second quarter of 2021 in accordance with the expected application of equity method accounting and $49 million of additional transaction-related costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021; partially offset by $41 million of income generated as a result of the applicable foreign exchange rates prevailing at the time of payment of the US dollar denominated advance to KCS and receipt of the related refund.\n\nThe Company also paid $97 million of bridge financing and other fees which were recorded in Interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, after accounting for all direct and incremental expenses as well as income generated from the merger termination fee, CN recorded additional income of $705 million ($616 million after-tax), as a result of its strategic decision to bid for KCS.\n\n## 5 - Revenues\n\nThe following table provides disaggregated information for revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions             | Year ended December 31,   | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Freight revenues        |                           |           |           |           |\n| Petroleum and chemicals |                           | $  3,229  | $  2,816  | $  2,631  |\n| Metals and minerals     |                           | 1,911     | 1,548     | 1,409     |\n| Forest products         |                           | 2,006     | 1,740     | 1,700     |\n| Coal                    |                           | 937       | 618       | 527       |\n| Grain and fertilizers   |                           | 2,783     | 2,475     | 2,609     |\n| Intermodal              |                           | 4,906     | 4,115     | 3,751     |\n| Automotive              |                           | 797       | 576       | 591       |\n| Total freight revenues  |                           | 16,569    | 13,888    | 13,218    |\n| Other revenues          |                           | 538       | 589       | 601       |\n| Total revenues  (1) (2) |                           | $  17,107 | $  14,477 | $  13,819 |\n\n|",

The effective tax rate is affected by recurring items in provincial, U.S. federal, state and other foreign jurisdictions, such as tax rates and the proportion of income earned in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items such as income tax rate enactments, and lower corporate income tax rates on capital dispositions and other transactions that may occur in any given year.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , a tax-and-spending package aimed at providing additional stimulus to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act corporate income tax measures allow for U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be fully carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the NOL. As a result of the CARES Act, the Company reclassified its 2019 deferred income tax asset of $213 million on the NOL that arose in 2019, to a current income tax receivable and recorded a current income tax recovery of $141 million in 2020 to reflect an amount recoverable at the higher U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% applicable to pre-2018 tax years.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions                                                            | Year ended December 31,   | 2022     | 2021     | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| Canadian statutory federal tax rate                                    |                           | 15%      | 15%      | 15%    |\n| Income tax expense at the Canadian statutory federal tax rate  (1)     |                           | $  1,014 | $  951   | $  678 |\n| Income tax expense resulting from:                                     |                           |          |          |        |\n| Provincial and foreign income taxes  (2)                               |                           | 657      | 617      | 414    |\n| Income tax adjustments due to rate enactments and tax law changes  (3) |                           | -        | -        | (141)  |\n| Non-taxable portion of merger termination fee  (4)                     |                           | -        | (116)    | -      |\n| Other  (5)                                                             |                           | (26)     | (9)      | 25     |\n| Income tax expense  (1)                                                |                           | $  1,645 | $  1,443 | $  976 |\n| Net cash payments for income taxes                                     |                           | $  1,288 | $  759   | $  353 |\n\nThe following table provides tax information on a domestic and foreign basis for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions                            | 2022     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Income before income taxes             |          |          |          |\n| Domestic  (1)                          | $  4,835 | $  4,726 | $  3,614 |\n| Foreign                                | 1,928    | 1,616    | 907      |\n| Total income before income taxes  (1)  | $  6,763 | $  6,342 | $  4,521 |\n| Current income tax expense (recovery)  |          |          |          |\n| Domestic                               | $  956   | $  763   | $  616   |\n| Foreign                                | 285      | 167      | (121)    |\n| Total current income tax expense       | $  1,241 | $  930   | $  495   |\n| Deferred income tax expense            |          |          |          |\n| Domestic  (1)                          | $  298   | $  360   | $  383   |\n| Foreign                                | 106      | 153      | 98       |\n| Total deferred income tax expense  (1) | $  404   | $  513   | $  481   |\n\n|",

The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2022, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $2.3 billion, and, based upon the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income of the necessary character over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, and the reversal of taxable temporary differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. As at December 31, 2022, the Company has not recognized a deferred income tax asset of $196 million (2021 - $264 million) on the unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to its net investment in U.S. subsidiaries, as the Company does not expect this temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 was $38 million. If recognized, $15 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $12 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2022 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations, and will not significantly affect the effective tax rate as they are mainly related to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded tax recoveries of $12 million and $2 million related to net reversals of interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a tax expense of $16 million related to net interest and penalties expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $13 million (2021 - $25 million).\n\nIn Canada, the Company's federal and provincial income tax returns filed for the years 2016 to 2021 remain subject to examination by the taxation authorities. An examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the year 2018 is currently in progress and is expected to be completed during 2023. In 2020, the tax authorities proposed certain audit adjustments and, as a result, the Company recorded a $25 million deferred tax expense which is comprised of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. During 2021 and 2022, the tax authorities finalized their audit adjustments related to certain tax positions and as a result, the Company re-evaluated the relevant tax positions for all open years and recorded deferred tax recoveries of $8 million and $13 million, respectively, reducing net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. In the U.S., the federal income tax returns filed for the years 2013 to 2021 and the state income tax returns filed for the years 2018 to 2021 remain subject to examination by the taxation authorities. The Company does not anticipate any significant impacts to its results of operations or financial position as a result of the final resolutions of such matters.\n\n|",

The government assistance related to properties has conditions of how the assistance is to be spent; such as the Company purchasing or self-constructing assets to improve CN assets and under limited transactions would require the Company to reimburse the assistance if certain conditions are not adhered to. The period for which the assistance is received coincides with the timing to complete the purchase or self-construction.\n\nThe Company accounts for government assistance received or receivable related to CN's property assets as a reduction from the cost of the assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Properties and depreciated over the same service life of the related assets in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received $70 million of government assistance towards the purchase and selfconstruction of properties.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total Properties balance of $43,537 million and $41,178 million, respectively, is net of $1,721 million and $1,689 million of unamortized government assistance, respectively, primarily related to the enhancement of CN's track and roadway infrastructure. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income is presented net of amortization of government assistance of $63 million.\n\n|",

This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment\n- to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 23 - Financial instruments - Interest rate risk ).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repaid the following:\n\n- \u00b7 On September 15, 2021, early redemption of US$400 million ($506 million) 2.85% Notes due 2021; and\n- \u00b7 On January 18, 2021, early redemption of $250 million 2.75% Notes due 2021.\n\n## Revolving credit facilities\n\nThe Company has an unsecured revolving credit facility with a consortium of lenders, which is available for general corporate purposes including backstopping the Company's commercial paper programs. On March 31, 2022, the Company's revolving credit facility agreement was amended, to extend the term of the credit facility by one year and transition from the benchmark on US borrowings from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The credit facility of $2.5 billion consists of a $1.25 billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2025 and a $1.25 billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2027. The revolving credit facility agreement is structured as a sustainability linked loan whereby its applicable margins are adjusted upon achievement of certain sustainability targets. Subject to the consent of the individual lenders, the Company has the option to increase the facility by an additional $500 million during its term and to request an extension once a year to maintain the tenors of three year and five year of the respective tranches. The credit facility provides for borrowings at various benchmark interest rates, such as the SOFR and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings and sustainability targets. There is no fallback language for CDOR.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility and there were no draws in 2022 and 2021.\n\nOn March 18, 2022, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion two-year unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a consortium of lenders. The credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and provides for borrowings at various benchmark interest rates, such as SOFR and CDOR, plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility and there were no draws in 2022.\n\nBoth revolving credit facility agreements have one financial covenant, which limits debt as a percentage of total capitalization. The Company is in compliance as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Equipment loans\n\nThe Company has a secured non-revolving term loan credit facility for financing or refinancing the purchase of equipment. The equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facility have a tenor of 20 years, bear interest at variable rates such as LIBOR and CDOR plus a margin, are repayable in equal quarterly installments, are prepayable at any time without penalty, and are secured by rolling stock.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company issued a US$310 million ($389 million) equipment loan under this facility. The Company repaid US$31 million ($40 million) and repaid US$27 million ($33 million) of equipment loans in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings of US$542 million ($734 million) and US$572 million ($723 million), respectively, at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.22% and 0.81%, respectively, and had no further amount available under this nonrevolving term loan facility.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nThe Company has a commercial paper program in Canada and in the U.S. Both programs are backstopped by the Company's revolving credit facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount of commercial paper that can be issued is $2.5 billion, or the US dollar equivalent, on a combined basis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of US$594 million ($805 million) and US$111 million ($140 million), respectively, at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.27% and 0.18%, respectively, presented in Current portion of longterm debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n|",

On January 19, 2023, the Company extended the term of its agreement by one year to February 1, 2025. The Company has retained the responsibility for servicing, administering and collecting the receivables sold. The average servicing period is approximately one month and the interest on borrowings under the Accounts receivable securitization program is renewed based on commercial paper rates then in effect or SOFR or CDOR if the commercial paper market is inaccessible and includes fallback language that allows for the succession of CDOR to an alternative rate consistent with market convention.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the proceeds received and repayment of the accounts receivable securitization program for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions       | Year ended December 31,   | 2022   | 2021 2020   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Beginning of year | $  -                      | $  -   | $  200      |\n| Proceeds received | -                         | -      | 450         |\n| Repayment         | -                         | -      | (650)       |\n| End of year       | $  -                      | $  -   | $  -        |\n\n## Bilateral letter of credit facilities\n\nThe Company has a series of committed and uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facility agreements. On March 31, 2022, the Company extended the maturity date of certain committed bilateral letter of credit facility agreements to April 28, 2025. The agreements are held with various banks to support the Company's requirements to post letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, the Company has the option from time to time to pledge collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents, for a minimum term of one month, equal to at least the face value of the letters of credit issued.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $396 million (2021 - $394 million) under the committed facilities from a total available amount of $470 million (2021 - $518 million) and $100 million (2021 - $158 million) under the uncommitted facilities.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $397 million (2021 - $396 million) and $100 million (2021 - $100 million) which were pledged as collateral under the committed and uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits\n\nThe Company has various retirement benefit plans under which substantially all of its employees are entitled to benefits at retirement age, generally based on compensation and length of service and/or contributions. Senior and executive management employees, subject to certain minimum service and age requirements, are also eligible for an additional retirement benefit under their Special Retirement Stipend Agreements, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or the Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.\n\nThe Company also offers postretirement benefits to certain employees providing life insurance, medical benefits and, for a closed group of employees, free rail travel benefits during retirement. These postretirement benefits are funded as they become due. The information in the tables that follow pertains to all of the Company's defined benefit plans. However, the following descriptions relate solely to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Amendments to postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S.\n\nIn June 2022, CN approved changes affecting members participating in the Company's postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S. Beginning in 2023, Medicare-eligible retirees will be covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees will continue to be covered by the existing selfinsured program. This change constitutes a plan amendment event resulting in a $28 million reduction to the affected plans' Accumulated projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income, and is composed of a prior service credit of $21 million and an actuarial gain of $7 million, substantially all due to lower expected future benefit payments and to the approximate 130 basis point increase in the end of period discount rates between the prior year end and May 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n## Curtailment event\n\nOn October 31, 2021, the CN Board of Directors approved changes affecting non-unionized members participating in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial gain, mostly due to reflecting projected future salary increases and service only up to April 1, 2024. The curtailment event also triggered an interim re-measurement of the funded status of the affected defined benefit pension plans resulting in an actuarial gain of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between December 31, 2020 (2.55%) and October 31, 2021 (3.39%), and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns ($982 million) compared to expected returns ($875 million) over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n## Description of the CN Pension Plan\n\nThe CN Pension Plan is a contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers the majority of CN employees. It provides for pensions based mainly on years of service and final average pensionable earnings and is generally applicable from the first day of employment. Indexation of pensions is provided after retirement through a gain/loss sharing mechanism, subject to guaranteed minimum increases. An independent trust company is the Trustee of the Company's pension trust funds (which includes the CN Pension Trust Fund). As Trustee, the trust company performs certain duties, which include holding legal title to the assets of the CN Pension Trust Fund and ensuring that the Company, as Administrator, complies with the provisions of the CN Pension Plan and the related legislation. The Company utilizes a measurement date of December 31 for the CN Pension Plan.\n\n## Funding policy\n\nEmployee contributions to the CN Pension Plan are determined by the plan rules. Company contributions are in accordance with the requirements of the Government of Canada legislation, the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , including amendments and regulations thereto, and such contributions follow minimum and maximum thresholds as determined by actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations are generally required on an annual basis for all Canadian defined benefit pension plans, or when deemed appropriate by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. These actuarial valuations are prepared in accordance with legislative requirements and with the recommendations of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries for the valuation of pension plans. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's most recently filed actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans conducted as at December 31, 2021 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.2 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $1.1 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit Standards Regulations, 1985 . The federal pension legislation requires funding deficits, if any, to be paid over a number of years, as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nThe Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans required as at December 31, 2022 will be performed in 2023. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.4 billion, while on a solvency basis a funding excess of approximately $1.6 billion is expected. Based on the anticipated results of these valuations, the CN Pension Plan is expected to remain fully funded and at a level such that the Company would continue to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan in 2023. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $55 million for all of the Company's pension plans in 2023. As at January 31, 2023 the Company had contributed $2 million to its defined benefit pension plans for 2023.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the Company's various Canadian defined benefit pension plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, geography, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIPP) which includes the plans' long-term target asset allocation (\"Policy\") and related benchmark indices. This Policy is based on the long-term expectations of the economy and financial market returns and considers the dynamics of the plans' pension benefit obligations. In 2022, the Policy was amended to implement a target asset allocation change to bonds and mortgages, equities and investment-related liabilities.\n\nThe CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plan, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the Plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan asset allocation to the Policy and Strategy and compares the actual performance of the Company's pension plan assets to the performance of the benchmark indices.\n\nThe Company's 2022 Policy and actual asset allocation for the Company's pension plans based on fair value are as follows:\n\n|                                 |        | Actual plan asset allocation   | Actual plan asset allocation   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                 | Policy | 2022                           | 2021                           |\n| Cash and short-term investments | 2 %    | 3 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Bonds and mortgages             | 38 %   | 35 %                           | 37 %                           |\n| Emerging market debt            | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Private debt                    | 3 %    | 6 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Equities                        | 32 %   | 30 %                           | 40 %                           |\n| Real estate                     | 4 %    | 3 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Resource and royalties          | 5 %    | 7 %                            | 5 %                            |\n| Infrastructure                  | 4 %    | 4 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Specialty portfolio  (1)        | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Absolute return                 | 12 %   | 15 %                           | 11 %                           |\n| Alternative risk premia         | - %    | 1 %                            | 1 %                            |\n| Investment-related liabilities  | (4 %)  | (8 %)                          | (8 %)                          |\n| Total                           | 100 %  | 100 %                          | 100 %                          |\n\nThe Committee's approval is required for all major investments in illiquid securities. The SIPP allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to implement strategies, hedge and adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. Investments held in the Company's pension plans consist mainly of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and short-term investments consist of highly liquid securities which ensure adequate cash flows are available to cover near-term benefit payments as well as anticipated cash requirements needed to support derivative instruments or any other contractual commitment. Short-term investments are mainly obligations issued by Canadian chartered banks and by Canadian governments.\n- \u00b7 Bonds include bond instruments, issued or guaranteed by governments and non-government entities. As at December 31, 2022, 76% (2021 - 80%) of bonds were issued or guaranteed by Canadian, U.S. or other governments. Mortgages consist of mortgage bonds, interest in mortgages or in funds making loans, all of which are secured by real estate. On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for bonds and\n\n|",

This comprises a 38% allocation mainly to government and corporate bonds and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to bond exposure.\n\n- \u00b7 Emerging market debt consists of units of co-mingled funds or in separate accounts managed by external managers whose mandate is to invest in debt instruments of emerging market countries.\n- \u00b7 Private debt includes participation in private debt securities and funds focused on generating steady yields.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments include publicly traded securities diversified by industry sector, geography and issuer and investments in private equity funds. As at December 31, 2022, the most significant allocation to an individual issuer of a publicly traded security was 4% (2021 - 4%) and the most significant allocation to an industry sector was 19% (2021 - 22%). On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for equities is 37%. This comprises a 32% allocation to equities and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to equity exposure.\n- \u00b7 Real estate is a diversified portfolio of Canadian land and commercial properties and investments in global real estate private equity funds.\n- \u00b7 Resource and royalties investments include petroleum and natural gas and mineral properties and listed and non-listed securities of resource and energy transition companies.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure investments include participation in private infrastructure funds, term loans and notes of infrastructure companies.\n- \u00b7 Specialty portfolio consists of mainly private equities, private debt, absolute return investments and public equities. Exposure to public assets may be included to manage the risk-return profile and tactical allocation relative to the Policy portfolio weight.\n- \u00b7 Absolute return investments are primarily a portfolio of units of externally managed hedge funds, which are invested in various long/short and derivatives strategies within multi-strategy, fixed income, commodity, equity, global macro funds and downside protection. Managers are monitored on a continuous basis through investment and operational due diligence.\n- \u00b7 Alternative risk premia investments are a portfolio of units of externally managed funds and internally managed strategies on a riskadjusted basis.\n- \u00b7 Investment-related liabilities reflect a certain level of financing associated with securities sold under repurchase agreements and other assets.\n\nThe plans' Investment Manager monitors market events and risk exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates, market risks, credit risks\n\nand liquidity risks daily. When investing in foreign securities, the plans are exposed to foreign currency risk that may be adjusted or hedged; the effect of which is included in the valuation of the foreign securities. Net of the adjusted or hedged amount, the plans were 57% exposed to the Canadian dollar, 28% to the US dollar, 8% to European currencies, 2% to the Japanese Yen and 5% to various other currencies as at December 31, 2022. Interest rate risk represents the risk that the fair value of the investments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Sensitivity to interest rates is a function of the timing and amount of cash flows of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities of the plans. Derivatives are contractual agreements whose value is derived from interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, or equities, among other fluctuating inputs and factors. They may include forwards, futures, options and swaps. Derivatives are included in the investment asset classes based on their underlying exposure and are used from time to time to synthetically replace any investment activity that would otherwise be accomplished through a direct investment in any investment asset class. When derivatives are used for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the derivatives are offset by a corresponding change in the value of the hedged assets. To manage counterparty credit risk, established policies require dealing with counterparties considered to be of high credit quality. Adequate liquidity is maintained to cover cash flows by monitoring factors such as fair value, collateral pledged and received, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.\n\nOverall return in the capital markets and the level of interest rates affect the funded status of the Company's pension plans, particularly the Company's main Canadian pension plan. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest rates from the date of the last actuarial valuations may have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the plans and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Under the Share Units Plan, the Company grants performance share unit (PSU) awards.\n\nPSU-ROIC awards settle depending on the level of attainment of a target return on invested capital (ROIC) performance condition, as defined by the award agreement, over the plan period of three years. The level of attainment of the performance condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200%. Settlement is also conditional upon the attainment of a minimum share price market condition, calculated using the average of the last three months of the plan period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The level of attainment of the market condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200% depending on the Company's TSR relative to a Class I Railways peer group and the S&P/TSX 60 companies.\n\nPSUs are settled in common shares of the Company, subject to the attainment of their respective performance and market conditions, by way of disbursement from the Share Trusts (see Note 19 - Share capital ). The number of shares remitted to the participant upon settlement is equal to the number of PSUs awarded multiplied by the performance factor, less shares withheld to satisfy the participant's withholding tax requirement.\n\nFor the 2020 grant, the level of ROIC attained resulted in a performance factor of 120%, and the level of TSR attained resulted in a performance factor of 162% for the plan period ended December 31, 2022. The total fair value of the equity settled PSU awards that vested in 2022 was $40 million (2021 - $30 million; 2020 - $27 million). As the respective performance and market conditions under each award were met as at December 31, 2022, a settlement of approximately 0.3 million shares, net of withholding taxes, is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the activity related to PSU awards for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                  | PSU-ROIC (1)   | PSU-ROIC (1)                           | PSU-TSR  (2)      | PSU-TSR  (2)                           |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Units          | Weighted-average grant date fair value | Units In millions | Weighted-average grant date fair value |\n|                                  | In millions    |                                        |                   |                                        |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021 | 0.8            | $  69.84                               | 0.4               | $  144.37                              |\n| Granted                          | 0.2            | $  81.03                               | 0.1               | $  180.18                              |\n| Settled  (3)                     | (0.3)          | $  70.79                               | (0.1)             | $  128.22                              |\n| Forfeited                        | -              | $  72.85                               | -                 | $  160.82                              |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022 | 0.7            | $  73.21                               | 0.4               | $  160.40                              |\n| Nonvested at December 31, 2021   | 0.5            | $  69.27                               | 0.3               | $  150.59                              |\n| Granted                          | 0.2            | $  81.03                               | 0.1               | $  180.18                              |\n| Vested  (4)                      | (0.2)          | $  73.92                               | (0.2)             | $  153.00                              |\n| Forfeited                        | -              | $  72.85                               | -                 | $  160.82                              |\n| Nonvested at December 31, 2022   | 0.5            | $  72.78                               | 0.2               | $  164.20                              |\n\nThe following table provides assumptions related to the fair values of PSU awards, and the weighted-average grant date fair values for units granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| Year of grant                               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assumptions                                 |        |        |        |\n| Stock price  ($) (1)                        | 153.81 | 133.36 | 125.82 |\n| Expected stock price volatility  (%)  (2)   | 25     | 24     | 17     |\n| Expected term  (years)  (3)                 | 3.0    | 3.0    | 3.0    |\n| Risk-free interest rate  (%) (4)            | 1.58   | 0.19   | 1.40   |\n| Dividend rate  ($)  (5)                     | 2.93   | 2.46   | 2.30   |\n| Weighted-average grant date fair value  ($) |        |        |        |\n| ROIC                                        | 81.03  | 64.50  | 73.92  |\n| TSR                                         | 181.00 | 148.02 | 153.00 |\n\n|",

A DSU is equivalent to a common share of the Company and also earns dividends when normal cash dividends are paid on common shares. The number of DSUs received by each participant is established at the time of deferral. For each participant, the Company will grant a further 25% of the amount elected in DSUs, which will vest over a period of four years. The election to receive eligible incentive payments in DSUs is no longer available to a participant when the value of the participant's vested DSUs is sufficient to meet the Company's stock ownership guidelines.\n\n## Equity settled awards\n\nDSUs are settled in common shares of the Company at the time of cessation of employment by way of an open market purchase by the Company. The number of shares remitted to the participant is equal to the number of DSUs awarded less shares withheld to satisfy the participant's withholding tax requirement.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the activity related to DSU equity awards for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                      | Equity settled DSUs  (1) Weighted-average   | Equity settled DSUs  (1) Weighted-average   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | Units                                       | grant date fair value                       |\n|                                      | In millions                                 |                                             |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021     | 0.5                                         | $  87.24                                    |\n| Granted                              | 0.1                                         | $  159.13                                   |\n| Settled  (2)                         | (0.3)                                       | $  83.28                                    |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022 (3) | 0.3                                         | $  106.60                                   |\n\n## Cash settled awards\n\nThe value of each participant's DSUs is payable in cash at the time of cessation of employment. The Company's liability for the cash settled VIDP is marked-to-market at each period-end and varies with the Company's share price. Fluctuations in the Company's share price cause volatility to stock-based compensation expense as recorded in Net income. The Company does not currently hold any derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the liability for cash settled DSUs was $7 million based on closing stock price of $160.84 (2021 - $9 million based on closing stock price of $155.38).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

As at December 31, 2022, 13.3 million common shares remained authorized for future issuances under these plans.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted 0.6 million (2021 - 0.7 million; 2020 - 0.7 million) stock options.\n\nThe following table provides the activity of stock option awards during 2022, and for options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2022, the weighted-average exercise price:\n\n|                                        | Options outstanding            | Options outstanding              | Nonvested options              | Nonvested options                       |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  exercise price | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  grant date fair value |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021   (1) | 3.6                            | $  105.32                        | 1.8                            | $  18.69                                |\n| Granted  (2)                           | 0.6                            | $  152.84                        | 0.6                            | $  27.00                                |\n| Forfeited/Cancelled                    | (0.3)                          | $  143.40                        | (0.3)                          | $  22.53                                |\n| Exercised  (3)                         | (0.6)                          | $  93.55                         | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n| Vested  (4)                            | N/A                            | N/A                              | (0.6)                          | $  17.57                                |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022  (1)  | 3.3                            | $  119.08                        | 1.5                            | $  21.96                                |\n| Exercisable at December 31, 2022  (1)  | 1.8                            | $  101.91                        | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n\nThe following table provides the number of stock options outstanding and exercisable as at December 31, 2022 by range of exercise price and their related intrinsic value, and for options outstanding, the weighted-average years to expiration.

See Note 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits.\n- (8) In the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed its method of calculating market-related values of pension assets for its defined benefit plans using a retrospective approach. Comparative figures have been restated to conform to the change in methodology.  See Note 2 - Change in accounting policy for additional information. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Pension and other post retirement benefit plan was restated by $347 million, from $4,321 million under to the prior method to $4,668 million.\n\n## 22 - Major commitments and contingencies\n\n## Purchase commitments\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had fixed and variable commitments to purchase information technology services and licenses, railroad cars, locomotives, wheels, rail, engineering services, rail ties as well as other equipment and services with a total estimated cost of $2,300 million. Costs of variable commitments were estimated using forecasted prices and volumes.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages, including actions brought on behalf of various purported classes of claimants and claims relating to employee and third-party personal injuries, occupational disease and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents.\n\n## Canada\n\nEmployee injuries are governed by the workers' compensation legislation in each province whereby employees may be awarded either a lump sum or a future stream of payments depending on the nature and severity of the injury. As such, the provision for employee injury claims is discounted. In the provinces where the Company is self-insured, costs related to employee work-related injuries are accounted for based on actuarially developed estimates of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. An actuarial study is generally performed at least on a triennial basis. For all other legal actions, the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recorded a decrease of $11 million, $11 million and $13 million, respectively, to its provision for personal injuries in Canada as a result of actuarial valuations for employee injury claims.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in Canada was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  182 | $  206 | $  207 |\n| Accruals and other            | 16     | 12     | 31     |\n| Payments                      | (30)   | (36)   | (32)   |\n| End of year                   | $  168 | $  182 | $  206 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  27  | $  50  | $  68  |\n\n## United States\n\nPersonal injury claims by the Company's employees, including claims alleging occupational disease and work-related injuries, are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). Employees are compensated under FELA for damages assessed based on a finding of fault through the U.S. jury system or through individual settlements. As such, the provision is undiscounted. With limited exceptions where claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Company follows an actuarial-based approach and accrues the expected cost for personal injury, including asserted and unasserted occupational disease claims, and property damage claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost. An actuarial study is performed annually.\n\nFor employee work-related injuries, including asserted occupational disease claims, and third-party claims, including grade crossing, trespasser and property damage claims, the actuarial valuation considers, among other factors, the Company's historical patterns of claims filings and payments. For unasserted occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation includes the projection of the Company's experience into the future considering the potentially exposed population. The Company adjusts its liability based upon management's assessment and the results of the study. On an ongoing basis, management reviews and compares the assumptions inherent in the latest actuarial valuation with the current claim experience and, if required, adjustments to the liability are recorded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events, including events related to occupational diseases, which include but are not limited to, the timing and number of actual claims, the average cost per claim and the legislative and judicial environment, the Company's future payments may differ from current amounts recorded.\n\nIn 2022, the Company recorded a decrease of $9 million to its provision for U.S. personal injury and other claims attributable to nonoccupational disease claims, third-party claims and occupational disease claims pursuant to the 2022 actuarial valuation. In 2021 and 2020, actuarial valuations resulted in a decrease of $20 million and a decrease of $10 million, respectively. The prior years' adjustments from the actuarial valuations were mainly attributable to non-occupational disease claims, third -party claims and occupational disease claims, reflecting changes in the Company's estimates of unasserted claims and costs related to asserted claims. The Company has an ongoing risk mitigation strategy focused on reducing the frequency and severity of claims through injury prevention and containment; mitigation of claims; and lower settlements of existing claims.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in the U.S. was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  125 | $  141 | $  145 |\n| Accruals and other            | 33     | 30     | 28     |\n| Payments                      | (39)   | (45)   | (29)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | 9      | (1)    | (3)    |\n| End of year                   | $  128 | $  125 | $  141 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  18  | $  25  | $  41  |\n\nAlthough the Company considers such provisions to be adequate for all its outstanding and pending claims, the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2022, or with respect to future claims, cannot be reasonably determined. When establishing provisions for contingent liabilities the Company considers, where a probable loss estimate cannot be made with reasonable certainty, a range of potential probable losses for each such matter, and records the amount it considers the most reasonable estimate within the range. However, when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. For matters where a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, a range of potential losses cannot be estimated due to various factors which may include the limited availability of facts, the lack of demand for specific damages and the fact that proceedings were at an early stage. Based on information currently available, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Company will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, due to the inherent inability to predict with certainty unforeseeable future developments, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, hazardous substances, and other materials; decommissioning of underground and aboveground storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations.\n\n## Known existing environmental concerns\n\nThe Company is or may be liable for remediation costs at individual sites, in some cases along with other potentially responsible parties, associated with actual or alleged contamination. The ultimate cost of addressing these known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established given that the estimated environmental liability for any given site may vary depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the nature of anticipated response actions, taking into account the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As a result, liabilities are recorded based on the results of a four-phase assessment conducted on a site-by-site basis. A liability is initially recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the costs related to a particular site using cost scenarios established by external consultants based on the extent of contamination and expected costs for remedial efforts. In the case of multiple parties, the Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective share of the liability. Adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as additional information becomes available.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's provision for specific environmental sites is undiscounted and includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as monitoring costs. Environmental expenses, which are classified as Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants as well as adjustments to initial estimates. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's provision for specific environmental sites was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  56  | $  59  | $  57  |\n| Accruals and other            | 27     | 23     | 44     |\n| Payments                      | (26)   | (26)   | (42)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | 2      | -      | -      |\n| End of year                   | $  59  | $  56  | $  59  |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  41  | $  38  | $  46  |\n\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of the liability at December 31, 2022 will be paid out over the next five years. Based on the information currently available, the Company considers its provisions to be adequate.\n\n## Unknown existing environmental concerns\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs. The magnitude of such additional liabilities and the costs of complying with future environmental laws and containing or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated due to many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the lack of specific technical information available with respect to many sites;\n- \u00b7 the absence of any government authority, third-party orders, or claims with respect to particular sites;\n- \u00b7 the potential for new or changed laws and regulations and for development of new remediation technologies and uncertainty regarding the timing of the work with respect to particular sites; and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the ability to recover costs from any third parties with respect to particular sites.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of any such costs being incurred or whether such costs would be material to the Company cannot be determined at this time. There can thus be no assurance that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future, or will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year, or that the Company's liquidity will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities or costs, although management believes, based on current information, that the costs to address environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. Costs related to any unknown existing or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Future occurrences\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. As a result, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws and other risks, including costs relating to the performance of cleanups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Company may incur significant capital and operating costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements, in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property. Operating expenses related to regulatory compliance activities for environmental matters for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $31 million (2021 $27 million; 2020 - $25 million). In addition, based on the results of its operations and maintenance programs, as well as ongoing environmental audits and other factors, the Company plans for specific capital improvements on an annual basis. Certain of these improvements help ensure facilities, such as fueling stations, waste water and storm water treatment systems, comply with environmental standards and include new construction and the updating of existing systems and/or processes. Other capital expenditures relate to assessing and remediating certain impaired properties. The Company's environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to $19 million (2021 $18 million; 2020 - $20 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $396 million (2021 - $394 million) under the committed bilateral letter of credit facilities and $100 million (2021 - $158 million) under the uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, and surety and other bonds of $171 million (2021 - $150 million), all issued by financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings to third parties to indemnify them in the event the Company does not perform its contractual obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the maximum potential liability under these guarantee instruments was $667 million (2021 - $702 million), of which $625 million (2021 - $659 million) related to other employee benefit liabilities and workers' compensation and $42 million (2021 - $43 million) related to other liabilities. The guarantee instruments expire at various dates between 2023 and 2025.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to guarantees as the Company did not expect to make any payments under its guarantees.\n\n## General indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications, customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business, in various agreements with third parties, including indemnification provisions where the Company would be required to indemnify third parties and others. During the year, the Company entered into various contracts with third parties for which an indemnification was provided. Due to the nature of the indemnification clauses, the maximum exposure for future payments cannot be reasonably determined. To the extent of any actual claims under these agreements, the Company maintains provisions for such items, which it considers to be adequate. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to any indemnifications.\n\n## 23 - Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company follows a financial risk management framework, which is monitored and approved by the Company's Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal cost of capital and preserving its liquidity. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments in the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar affect the Company's revenues and expenses. To manage foreign currency risk, the Company designates US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. As a result, from the dates of designation, foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the Company's US dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase a notional value of US$1,311 million (2021 - US$910 million). These outstanding contracts are at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.33 per US$1.00 (2021 - $1.27 per US$1.00) with exchange rates ranging from $1.29 to $1.37 per US$1.00 (2021 - $1.25 to $1.28 per US$1.00). The weighted-average term of the contracts is 157 days (2021 - 251 days) with terms ranging from 29 days to 300 days (2021 - 112 days to 352 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $129 million (2021 - loss of $18 million; 2020 - loss of $3 million) related to foreign exchange forward contracts. These gains and losses were largely offset by the re-measurement of US dollardenominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in Other income. As at December 31, 2022, the fair value of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $33 million and $4 million, respectively (2021 - $nil and $2 million, respectively).\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, the Company manages its borrowings in line with liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements.\n\nDuring the year, CN entered into treasury lock agreements to hedge US Treasury benchmark rates related to an expected debt issuance in 2022. The treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedging instruments with cumulative gains or losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in derivative instruments. On August 5, 2022, CN settled a notional US$675 million ($868 million) of treasury locks in conjunction with the issuances of US$800 million ($1,028 million) Notes due 2032 and US$700 million ($900 million) Notes due 2052, resulting in a cumulative loss of $2 million. This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, there were no treasury locks outstanding.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe financial instruments that the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value. These financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill and other, is classified as Level 1 with gains and losses being recorded in Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as Level 2 and is used to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities. The fair value of assets held for sale, included in Other current assets is classified as Level 3. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 6 - Assets held for sale.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2022, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $15,419 million (2021 - $12,475 million) and a fair value of $14,137 million (2021 - $14,424 million). The carrying amount of debt excluding finance leases exceeded the fair value due to an increase in market rates compared to the stated coupon rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company's management is responsible for, among others, CN's marketing strategy, the management of large customer accounts, overall planning and control of infrastructure and rolling stock, the allocation of resources, and other functions such as financial planning, accounting and treasury.\n\nThe role of each region is to manage the day-to-day service requirements within their respective territories and control direct costs incurred locally. Such cost control is required to ensure that pre-established efficiency standards set at the corporate level are met. The regions execute the overall corporate strategy and operating plan established by the Company's management, as the regions' management of throughput and control of direct costs does not serve as the platform for the Company's decision-making process. Approximately 94% of the Company's freight revenues are from national accounts for which freight traffic spans North America and touches various commodity groups. As a result, the Company does not manage revenues on a regional basis since a large number of the movements originate in one region and pass through and/ or terminate in another region.\n\nThe regions also demonstrate common characteristics in each of the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 each region's sole business activity is the transportation of freight over the Company's extensive rail network;\n- \u00b7 the regions service national accounts that extend over the Company's various commodity groups and across its rail network;\n- \u00b7 the services offered by the Company stem predominantly from the transportation of freight by rail with the goal of optimizing the rail network as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the Company and its subsidiaries, not its regions, are subject to regulatory regimes in both Canada and the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, no major customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues and the\n\nlargest freight customer represented less than 4% of total annual freight revenues.\n\nThe following tables provide information by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and as at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n| In millions           | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenues              |           |           |           |\n| Canada                | $  11,583 | $  9,955  | $  9,588  |\n| U.S.                  | 5,524     | 4,522     | 4,231     |\n| Total revenues        | $  17,107 | $  14,477 | $  13,819 |\n| Net income            |           |           |           |\n| Canada  (1)           | $  3,581  | $  3,603  | $  2,615  |\n| U.S.                  | 1,537     | 1,296     | 930       |\n| Total net income  (1) | $  5,118  | $  4,899  | $  3,545  |\n| In millions           | 2022      | 2021      |           |\n| Properties            |           |           |           |\n| Canada                | $  24,069 | $  23,186 |           |\n| U.S.                  | 19,468    | 17,992    |           |\n| Total properties      | $  43,537 | $  41,178 |           |\n\n## 25 - Subsequent event\n\n## Normal course issuer bid\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new NCIB, which allows for the repurchase of up to 32.0 million common shares between February 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024.\n\n|",
