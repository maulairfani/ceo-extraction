        "page_content": "## Strategic imperative: Focusing relentlessly on the growth markets of data, IP and wireless\n\nTELUS technology solutions (TTech) service revenues increased by $685 million or 5.9% in 2021. Our main drivers of growth include: (i) increased internet and data service revenues, as well as smart food-chain technology and other fixed data services revenues, driven by higher revenue per customer resulting from internet speed upgrades, subscriber base growth, business acquisitions and expanded services; (ii) growth in our mobile and connected devices subscriber bases; and (iii) growth in health services revenues, as further described below.\n\nTTech fixed data services revenues increased by $482 million or 12.2% in 2021. The increase was driven by: (i) increased internet and data service revenues, reflecting higher revenue per customer resulting from internet speed upgrades, larger allotted data internet rate plans and rate changes, in addition to a 6.2% increase in our internet subscriber base over the 12 months of 2021; (ii) increased revenues from smart food-chain technology, driven by business acquisitions; (iii) higher TV revenues, reflecting subscriber growth of 4.1% over the 12 months of 2021; and (iv) increased revenues from home and business security driven by expanded services and customer growth of 13.7% over the 12 months of 2021. This growth was partly offset by the ongoing decline in legacy data service revenues.\n\nTTech mobile network revenue increased by $178 million or 3.0% in 2021, generated from increases in our mobile subscriber base, including growth of Internet of Things (IoT) connections, in addition to growth in monthly recurring charges reflecting a greater mix of high-value customer additions and selection of higher-tier plans. These impacts were partly offset by lower chargeable data usage revenue as customer continue to adopt larger data allotments in their rate plans, the impact of the competitive environment putting pressure on base rate plan prices, and lower roaming revenues as declines in the first quarter of 2021 exceeded modest roaming recoveries in the latter portion of 2021.\n\nTTech health service revenues increased by $73 million or 16.3% in 2021, driven by: (i) business acquisitions; (ii) increased in-clinic services in our reopened TELUS Health Care Centres, whereas clinics were impacted by mandated lockdowns last year; (iii) higher revenues from the continued adoption of our virtual care solutions; and (iv) growth in health benefits management services with plan members resuming the use of elective health services.\n\nOur digital and customer experience (DLCX) solutions operating revenues increased by $573 million or 33.0% in 2021, attributable in part to growth generated from our acquisitions, particularly within our tech and games clients. The remainder of the growth was organic, coming from growth in services provided to existing clients, as well as new clients added since the prior year.\n\nTELUS Consolidated service revenues increased by $1,258 million or 9.5% in 2021, which exemplified our commitment to a highly differentiated and potent asset mix geared towards high-growth, technology-oriented verticals. In addition, as announced on March 25, 2021, our advanced capital investments in our fibre build and 5G coverage, as well as other capital investments which enable us to support continuing subscriber growth, deliver on our digitization strategy and drive product enhancements, will bolster top-line revenue growth and enhance our strong competitive positioning.\n\n## Strategic imperative: Going to market as one team under a common brand, executing a single strategy\n\nOur team works together to implement our top corporate priority: putting customers first, as we strive to consistently deliver exceptional client experiences and become the most recommended company in the markets we serve. The Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) annual reports have indicated the successful results of this strategy.\n\nIn November 2020, the CCTS issued its annual report for the 12-month period ended July 31, 2020, which determined that TELUS was again the subject of the fewest customer complaints among national carriers and Koodo was again the subject of the fewest complaints among the national flanker brands. TELUS, Koodo and Public Mobile each saw year-overyear reductions in the total customer complaints accepted by the CCTS with improvements of (27.6)%, (9.0)% and (41.4)%, respectively. Total industry complaints decreased year-over-year by 18.8%.\n\nIn December 2021, the CCTS issued its annual report for the 12-month period ended July 31, 2021, and TELUS again received the fewest customer complaints among national carriers, while Koodo again received the fewest complaints among national flanker brands. Although total industry complaints accepted by the CCTS increased by 8.6% year-overyear, complaints involving TELUS increased at a lesser rate of 4.7%.\n\nThroughout 2020, we continued to leverage our Connecting for Good programs to support marginalized Canadians through the global pandemic and also expanded program eligibility to support those who need it most.\n\n- \uf0b7 We expedited access to our Internet for Good program to kindergarten to grade 12 students in need through partnerships with school boards and principals and expanded the program to include low-income people with disabilities. Over 400,000 vulnerable Canadians were eligible to receive low cost, high-speed internet in B.C., Alberta and Quebec. During 2020, we supported nearly 33,000 Canadians, bringing the number of Canadians benefiting from our Internet for Good program since its launch to close to 72,000 at December 31, 2020.\n- \uf0b7 In partnership with the Children's Aid Foundation of Canada, we expanded our Mobility for Good program nationally to all youth aging out of foster care. In December 2020, we expanded the program to include low-income seniors across Canada who are receiving the guaranteed income supplement (GIS), providing access to the technology they need to stay connected to loved ones and address feelings of isolation, enjoy their favourite online\n\n<!-- image -->",

Available at https://telus.com/Wiseworkshops, the first workshop offers important tips about protecting one's online safety and privacy, while the second workshop shares tips and guidance on navigating screen time, gaming, sexting, cyberbullying and helping youth stay safe in our digital world.\n\nIn March 2020, the arm's-length TELUS Friendly Future Foundation, together with the TELUS Community Boards, announced a commitment to help build public healthcare capacity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, including funding for new technology and equipment, such as ventilators, as well as increased support for food banks, elderly Canadians and mental health programs.\n\nIn 2020, we donated $500,000 to a research team from the Vancouver General Hospital and University of British Columbia Hospital Foundation to assist in the search for therapeutic antiviral treatments for COVID-19.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we launched our #StayStrongStayConnected video in English and French on our social media handles, intended to help share positive messages and keep citizens connected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March 2020, we introduced our TELUS Talks podcast. We produced 49 podcast episodes throughout 2020, including episodes with guests Dr. Bonnie Henry, Dr. Michael Osterholm, Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9 and Carol Todd. We garnered more than 118,000 listens, helping to support Canadians with information and insights to manage through a most unprecedented year.\n\nFor the first time, our annual TELUS Days of Giving became a year-long virtual event in 2020, with TELUS team members, retirees and fellow Canadians volunteering - safely and virtually - to support our local communities. As of December 31, 2020, our TELUS family had participated in 1.2 million safe acts of giving, including more than 1.25 million volunteer hours of service, sewing 150,000 masks and donating 210,000 TELUS-branded masks.\n\nCommencing in the second quarter of 2020, TELUS-branded, non-medical masks were made available in adult and youth sizes to help keep Canadians safe, with all proceeds going to the TELUS Friendly Future Foundation to support COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold 79,000 masks, raising more than $535,000 to support the work of our Foundation.\n\nIn 2011, we initiated our first set of long-term energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and surpassed them in early 2019, ahead of our 2020 target. As such, in our 2019 sustainability report issued during the second quarter of 2020, we released our new transformational climate action targets, including having our operations become net carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nIn May 2020, we launched our #StandWithOwners program in support of Canadian small businesses through the pandemic, committing in direct revenue, marketing and expert advice to support, promote and celebrate small business owners.\n\nAs part of our annual 2020 Kits for Kids program, in 2020 we donated 13,000 backpacks filled with essential school supplies and reusable youth-sized face masks to support a successful return to learning.\n\nOn World Mental Health Day in October, 2020, we premiered our latest TELUS Originals documentary, Dark Cloud, which spotlights the stories and life-altering impacts of cyberbullying in Canada. As of the 2020 year-end, we achieved 709,000 documentary views across Optik TV and YouTube. With Canadians spending more time than ever online during the COVID-19 pandemic, from socializing to schooling, this film is relevant for parents, youth and all Canadians, as it shares insights into what causes cyberbullying and how we can stop it.\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to leverage our Connecting for Good programs to support marginalized Canadians through the global pandemic and also expanded program eligibility to support those who need it most.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At our quarterly board meetings, our Board reviews reports and engages in discussions on corporate strategies, progress and targets, in addition to emerging risks and opportunities for innovation such as how technology can assist in responding to climate-related extreme weather events.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee (CGC) of our Board reviews and monitors, on behalf of the Board, the Company's approach, planning and reporting on sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters; and reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the Company's annual sustainability and ESG report and other related disclosures. Our Sustainability and Environment and Enterprise Risk Management teams provide quarterly reports to the CGC. These reports contain pertinent information regarding our environmental and climaterelated risks and related compliance activities. The CGC also oversees climate-related opportunities as they arise or are otherwise identified and discussed during quarterly CGC meetings.\n\nOur Board succession planning process involves an ongoing assessment of Board member skills which helps the CGC and the Board identify any gaps in the skills and competencies considered most relevant for the Company. As part of this process, Board members are asked to identify their experience or education as it relates to sustainability, environment and climate risk management.\n\n## Management oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Executive Team are responsible for the execution of the strategic direction of our sustainability programs, which includes assessing and managing climate-related risk and mitigation as well as identifying climate-related opportunities.\n\nOur Sustainability and Environment Team reports to our Senior Vice President & Treasurer, who is responsible for the development and governance of our sustainability strategy.\n\nThe Sustainability and Environment Team seeks to assess climate-related risks and opportunities by integrating sustainability considerations and implementing projects across the business, delivering in-house training and awareness on sustainability, and managing our EMS, which is ISO 14001:2015 certified in Canada. This process includes benchmarking through formal and informal materiality assessments, data and scenario analysis, considering internal and external stakeholder input and reviewing the regulatory environment in which we operate.\n\nAs we work to mitigate the climate impacts of our own operations, we also integrate climate considerations throughout our product development and innovation processes across our business including in emerging areas such as TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods. As we enhance our current products and develop new ones, we work to consider relevant climate risks and opportunities to align with our low-carbon future.\n\nAdditionally, we link our sustainability performance to compensation through our corporate scorecard, which affects the company-wide performance bonus structure. The social capitalism index within the scorecard contains metrics which measure our performance in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as social impact metrics. In addition, our Sustainability and Environment team's performance bonus structure is linked more broadly to our 2025 and 2030 environmental goals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate-related physical risks are those resulting from the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events, rising global temperatures, and other chronic climate changes, in our operations, our supply chain, and in our communities. We identify transition risks as those related to climate change, including the impact of changes in policy or implementation of lower-emission technology.\n\nSome of the physical and transitional climate risks we have identified that may impact us in the short-term (one to five years), include, but are not limited to: carbon regulation including carbon pricing impacting our operations and value chain; increased energy demand and its environmental and financial impacts; and growing customer and other stakeholder demand for low-carbon solutions.\n\nSome of the physical and transitional climate risks we have identified that may impact us in the medium to longterm (more than five years), include, but are not limited to: direct and indirect supply chain disruptions, including price increases; reliability and resiliency of critical infrastructure; and financial impacts resulting from not achieving climaterelated goals such as those included in our Sustainability-Linked Bonds.\n\n## Climate-related opportunities identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nWith world-class networks, a customers first approach and shareholder-friendly initiatives, we aim to improve the lives of Canadians and our communities while providing robust shareholder returns. Our corporate strategy enables us to respond nimbly to opportunities, including those consistent with adapting to rising climate risks and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Furthermore, our Sustainability and Environment team regularly seeks opportunities to invest in climate technologies, implement trials and seek out new, financially sound opportunities to reduce our GHG impact.\n\nOur business investments connect our country's dispersed population digitally, and as a result, attract customers who are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. In addition, we continue to focus on investments in network optimization, infrastructure upgrades, real estate space reduction and lighting retrofits to drive future savings and absolute energy reductions.\n\nThe following are examples of climate-related opportunities that we are currently pursuing:\n\n- \u25cf We have a corporate-wide goal to effectively procure 100% of our electricity requirements from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2025 and, in an effort to reach that goal, we have signed four VPPAs with wind and solar energy developers in Alberta for over 167 MW of renewable energy capacity.\n- \u25cf We have built a broadband network that enables our customers to live and work in locations of their choosing while minimizing their travel-related environmental footprint and optimizing productivity.\n- \u25cf For over a decade, TELUS Health has been working with health authorities, community partners and stakeholders to build a more sustainable healthcare system leveraging the power of technology. TELUS Health offers healthcare products that allow customers to connect virtually with healthcare practitioners, which improves efficiency of services offered, limits physical travel-related climate impacts, and increases accessibility to prevention and wellness services for those who seek it.\n- \u25cf TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods provides innovative solutions to empower a sustainable agriculture industry through technology, securely linking together the food value chain and leveraging data to increase efficiencies, production and yields.\n- \u25cf TELUS continues to develop new LEED certified buildings that incorporate world-leading technology, energy efficient and sustainable solutions and contemporary workstyles. We recently opened the doors to TELUS Sky, our latest LEED platinum building in downtown Calgary.\n- \u25cf We continue to expand our Work Styles program that allows over 90% of our domestic team members to work from home, reducing the emissions associated with commuting.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the opportunities stated above, we will continue to develop low-carbon and climate friendly solutions for our customers and communities, enabled by our networks, in the medium to long term (over five years). For example, through our TELUS Ventures and Pollinator for Good funds, we are investing in responsible startups driving social and environmental change to make the world a better place.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nWe conduct scenario analyses to better understand the resilience of our corporate strategy in different climate scenarios. Performing and disclosing the outcome of the various scenarios help us determine how our operations can prepare and help mitigate changes in climate, as new climate regulations, technologies and other impacts emerge\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, these analyses also help us identify new opportunities for our business and help us inform our stakeholders about how our organization is positioning itself in light of these risks and opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, we undertook a comprehensive qualitative scenario analysis assessment of our direct operations (excludes our upstream and downstream activities) with an independent third party to better align with TCFD recommendations. We broke down the assessment between transitional climate risks and opportunities assessment and physical climate risks assessment.\n\n- 1) Transitional climate risks and opportunities assessment\n\nThe following steps were taken to short-list, prioritize and assess the transition risks and opportunities to which we may be susceptible in different warming scenarios in the future:\n\n- 1) Longlist identification - First, we collated a comprehensive list of risks and opportunities based on our business operations, peer analysis, internal knowledge capacity and emerging trends.  This resulted in a long-list of 21 transition risks and opportunities which were assessed to delineate potential impacts (financial, reputational and market) on our business.\n- 2) Prioritization - Those 21 transition risks and opportunities were assessed against three parameters:\n- (i) Likelihood - the probability of each risk or opportunity occurring\n- \u25cf Occurring now or is almost certain to occur\n- \u00b7 Risk is inherent to the industry due to external influences\n- \u00b7 Precise understanding of where and when event would occur\n- \u25cf Likely to occur in the next 18 months\n- \u00b7 High level understanding of where and when event would occur\n- \u25cf Unlikely to occur within the next 18 months\n- \u00b7 High level understanding of where and when event would occur\n- (ii) Consequences - the magnitude of the impact if the event were to happen\n- \u25cf High financial impact\n- \u00b7 Risk: potential regulatory fines or prolonged provincial media coverage affecting brand/reputation\n- \u00b7 Opportunity: high positive impact on brand/reputation\n- \u25cf Medium financial impact\n- \u00b7 Risk: potential external reporting requirements, breach of contract or regional media coverage affecting brand/reputation\n- \u00b7 Opportunity: medium positive impact on brand/reputation\n- \u25cf Low financial impact\n- \u00b7 Risk: potential internal reporting requirements, breach of company policy or local media coverage affecting brand/reputation\n- \u00b7 Opportunity: low positive impact on brand/reputation\n- (iii) Velocity - the speed of the impact.\n\nThis resulted in an overall risk rating for each of the 21 transition risks and opportunities that was broadly classified into low, medium and high to indicate materiality. These estimates are adjusted for inflation throughout.\n\n- 3) Initial quantitative assessment - Next, we evaluated the quantitative impact of one of the identified risks noted above, which was carbon pricing, since data was readily available for this risk. This was assessed in the two climate scenarios and time horizons and fed into the qualitative assessment. The climate scenarios chosen for this step were the Bank of Canada scenarios which outline the risk outcomes that would impact the Canadian economy and financial system and were most applicable to us given that our operations are mostly in Canada. The Bank of Canada derived their country-level scenarios from the Network for Greening the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank of Canada's 2019 Policies and Net Zero 2050 (1.5\u00b0 Celsius) were considered to provide the widest range of possible climate outcomes. We then updated the 2019 Policies scenario to include carbon pricing data from the Pan Canadian Approach to Carbon Pollution Pricing, giving us the business as usual (BAU) policies scenario.\n\nThese are the parameters that were used to conduct the quantitative assessment.\n\n| Select credible  transition  pathways   | Climate  model   | Transition  pathways          | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Select credible  transition  pathways   | Bank of  Canada  | 2019 Policies                 | A scenario consistent with 2019  climate policies which are already  in place or announced.                                                                     | Establish the baseline to quantify  transition risks from the changing  carbon price in dollar amount.                                                                                      |\n| Select credible  transition  pathways   | Bank of  Canada  | Net-zero 2050  (1.5\u00b0 Celsius) | An ambitious immediate policy  action scenario to limit average  global warming to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius that  includes current net-zero  commitments by some countries. | Enable the exploration of an  ambitious transition scenario  piloted by the Bank of Canada and  Office of the Superintendent of  Financial Institutions to assess  climate transition risk. |\n\nThe financial impact of carbon pricing risk was estimated by multiplying the projected carbon price with projected amount of emissions for the two scenarios. Carbon price in the Net Zero scenario is projected to be much higher than the current policies scenario. By meeting our emission reduction targets, we may be able to reduce our carbon price risk significantly in both the short and long term. The results of this analysis allowed us to determine the likelihood and consequence ratings in the qualitative assessment.\n\n- 4) Qualitative assessment: The short-listed risks and opportunities (from step 2 above) were assessed against the two climate scenarios to evaluate their overall impact on our operations in the medium-term (2030) and long-term (2050). The Bank of Canada climate scenarios BAU policies; Net Zero 1.5\u00b0 Celsius were used for the qualitative assessment.\n- \u25cf The two climate scenarios were chosen to provide appropriate diversity to future outcomes.\n- \u25cf Key parameters such as policy changes, technology developments and availability, energy mix, commodity market dynamics, etc. were discerned to help define development pathways and trends over the assessed timeframe.\n- \u25cf The trends were studied against the shortlist to evaluate how they are likely to evolve in the future and the implications for us.\n\nPlease note that these scenarios are a tool to envision a future of two divergent climate scenarios, so that we can outline plausible risks and opportunities, and plan for resilience. They are not future predictions.\n\n## 2030 Risks\n\n| Sub- Category     | Description                                                                                 | Scenario      | Likelihood                                                                                                         | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                 | Risk  Rating   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Policy and  legal | Increased and/or  uncertain carbon  prices, including the  indirect impact of  carbon costs | BAU  policies | This scenario includes the Pan  Canadian Approach to Carbon  Pollution Pricing, therefore the  likelihood is high. | The price used in the Pan- Canadian Approach to Carbon  Pollution Pricing for 2030 is  $170 per tonne.

The scope of this assessment involved the determination of what to include as our key assets. The starting point was an assessment of over 21,000 assets, along with information on whether that asset was leased or owned, its location (address and coordinates), property usage code and square footage. Then the list was reduced by asset category and certain assets were assessed for criticality by considering a number of different factors, e.g. whether it's a 5G wireless core site. Next, we assessed asset value, such as the value of the building/asset, the value of the contents and the potential business interruption value. As a result of this scoping, 149 assets were included in the physical climate risk assessment, which included all of our critical sites.\n\nOur approach to the quantitative assessment can be broken down into our considering the likelihood of the risk occurring, the consequence of the impact, and using the results from these two assessments to qualitatively assess the relative impact magnitude:\n\nLikelihood: The likelihood of a risk occurring was assessed using the S&P TruCost Physical Risk data. This data provides a physical risk point-in-time exposure score to climate hazards relative to global conditions, independent of the characteristics of the asset present at a given location. This data was developed in order to provide companies with a data set to help understand physical risk exposure at the portfolio level, and to prioritize the assets within the portfolio.\n\n- \u25cf Inputs:\n- \u00b7 Asset location data\n- \u00b7 Climate scenario data which provides an exposure score\n\nConsequence : relates back to the importance of the asset and the level of impact that would be felt if the asset was put out of commission.\n\n- \u25cf Inputs:\n- \u00b7 Asset value and cost of business interruption\n- \u00b7 Hazard type\n\nResulting risk rating: comprised of the likelihood of the risks occurring and the resulting consequences of the event\n\n- \u25cf Output: A qualitative risk score for each asset for each hazard (very low, low, medium, high or very high)\n\nS&P TruCost Physical Risk Data has four built-in scenarios, aligning with different levels of warming. These scenarios are built using the combined Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) pathways that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used in the latest Sixth Assessment\n\n<!-- image -->",

We define business risk as the degree of exposure associated with the achievement of key strategic objectives in relation to the effectiveness and efficiency of operations; reliability and integrity of financial reporting; compliance with laws and regulations, policies, procedures and contracts; and, safeguarding of assets within an ethical organizational culture.\n\nWe assess and manage climate risks as part of a broader enterprise risk management program. Climate-related physical risks as well as risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon environment are integrated within our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which solicits and incorporates the expertise and insight of team\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "members from all areas and levels of the organization, including our Board. Our enterprise risks arise primarily from our business environment and risk identification, and assessment drives our strategies and business objectives. Climate risks, as well as all other risks in our ERM Risk Register, are reviewed each quarter and are assessed for their perceived impacts in the short, medium and long-term.\n\nWe also maintain an enterprise-wide, award-winning business continuity management program that is aligned with our corporate priorities, including prioritizing the safety of our team members, minimizing the impacts of threats to our facilities, business operations and supply chain, maintaining service to our customers and keeping our communities connected. Ongoing risk-based optimization of our disaster recovery capabilities for our IT and telecommunication network assets is a key focus for preventing outages and limiting their impact on our operations and customers.\n\n## Process for managing climate-related risk\n\nWe mitigate all risk types, including climate, through contract terms, contingency planning and other risk response strategies, as appropriate. We strive to avoid taking on undue risk whenever possible and work to align risks with business strategies, objectives, values and risk tolerances. Residual exposure for certain risks are mitigated through insurance coverage, where we judge this to be efficient and commercially viable. Our specific strategy for managing climate-related risks includes three key components:\n\n- \u25cf Mitigation: focusing on reducing energy use and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions\n- \u25cf Adaptation: focusing on business continuity planning and readiness for the potential physical risks of a changing climate on our operations\n- \u25cf Innovation: helping customers realize their climate change goals through product and service solutions such as video-conferencing.\n\nSevere weather risk is a primary aspect of our climate-related risk management framework and is categorized as either having team member impacts, facility impacts or service delivery impacts. These risks are categorized and reported to the Audit Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis where such risks may impact regions in which we operate.\n\nMitigation initiatives to address severe weather threats have been an increasing focus and we have operationalized enhanced processes with respect to severe weather monitoring, notification of key stakeholders, and incident management, in addition to updating climate incident playbooks that leverage learnings from prior events. These measures occur in both short-term and long-term planning.\n\n## Short-term climate risk mitigation\n\nOn a weekly basis, our Corporate Business Continuity Office (CBCO) publishes a severe weather outlook for all operating jurisdictions to highlight severe weather events which could pose a threat to our operations, complemented by daily severe weather threat monitoring and notifications for key internal stakeholders.\n\nThe CBCO also hosts biannual seasonal preparedness workshops to create awareness and enhance our preparedness for anticipated seasonal threats. The workshops focus on upcoming seasonal trends, potential threats, and reviewing lessons learned from past incidents.\n\nWe maintain a property risk governance program that systematically identifies, evaluates, manages and monitors property related risks at critical network facilities. This program also assists in the identification of natural catastrophic hazards.\n\n## Long-term climate risk mitigation\n\nWe conduct flood and seismic studies every five to seven years to identify the most vulnerable sites and assist in possible future mitigation strategies. We also support various municipalities on climate change adaptation initiatives by representing the telecommunications industry in advising how the changing risk landscape, as a result of climate change, could affect the delivery of our services to citizens, businesses and communities.\n\nOur ISO 14001:2015 certified EMS, used to identify and control the environmental impacts associated with our operations, is audited annually to assess compliance with standard applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n## (d) Metrics and Targets\n\nMetrics used to identify climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nWe assess climate-related risks and opportunities by tracking and disclosing our GHG emissions and energy consumption. Our most significant sources of GHG emissions and energy consumption consist of direct energy and indirect energy for owned and leased real estate properties in Canada, cell tower sites, vehicle fleet, and remote\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Board reviews the dividend rate quarterly. Our quarterly dividend rate will depend on an ongoing assessment of free cash flow generation and financial indicators including leverage, dividend yield and payout ratio. On February 8, 2023, a first quarter dividend of $0.3511 per share was declared, payable on April 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2023. The first quarter dividend for 2023 reflects a cumulative increase of $0.0237 per share from the $0.3274 per share dividend paid in April 2022, consistent with our multi-year dividend growth program.\n\nWe first announced our dividend growth program in May 2011. In May 2022, we announced our intention to target ongoing semi-annual dividend increases, with the annual increase in the range of 7 to 10% from 2023 through to the end of 2025, thereby extending the policy first announced in May 2011. Notwithstanding this target, dividend decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment and the determination of our financial position and outlook on a quarterly\n\n<!-- image -->",

There can be no assurance that we will maintain a dividend growth program through 2025.\n\n## 7. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n## 7.1 General description of capital structure\n\nThe authorized capital of TELUS consists of 6,000,000,000 shares, divided into: (1) 4,000,000,000 Common Shares without par value; (2) 1,000,000,000 First Preferred shares without par value, issuable in series and; (3) 1,000,000,000 Second Preferred shares without par value, issuable in series.

Holders of Common Shares are entitled to vote by a separate resolution for each director rather than a slate.\n\nThe Common Shares are subject to constraints on transfer to ensure our ongoing compliance with the Canadian ownership and control requirements of the Telecommunications Act and the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) under the Broadcasting Act as noted in Constraints - Canadian ownership and control requirements .\n\nPlease see Sections 9.4 - Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings and 10.3 - Regulatory matters of our 2022 annual MD&A which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n## First Preferred shares\n\nThe First Preferred shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each series comprising the number of shares, and having attached thereto the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions which the Board determines by resolution and subject to filing an amendment to the Notice of Articles and Articles of TELUS. No series of First Preferred shares may have attached thereto the right to vote at any general meeting of TELUS or the right to be convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares. Except as required by law, the holders of the First Preferred shares as a class are not entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at any meeting of the shareholders of TELUS. The First Preferred shares rank prior to the Second Preferred shares and Common Shares with respect to priority in payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of TELUS.\n\nAs of February 9, 2023, there are no First Preferred shares outstanding.\n\n## Second Preferred shares\n\nThe Second Preferred shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each series comprising the number of shares, and having attached thereto the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions, which the Board determines by resolution and subject to filing an amendment to the Notice of Articles and Articles of TELUS.

For further details, please refer to the Rights Plan, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at sedar.com on EDGAR at www.sec.gov as an exhibit to TELUS' registration statement on Form 8-A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 10, 2019 (Commission File No. 001-15144) or available from TELUS' Corporate Governance office, 7 th Floor, 510 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 0M3.\n\n## Normal course issuer bid and shelf prospectus\n\nPlease see Section 4.3 - Liquidity and capital resources of our 2022 annual MD&A which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n## 7.2 Constraints\n\n## Canadian ownership and control requirements\n\nCertain subsidiaries of TELUS Corporation are Canadian carriers, holders of radio authorizations and holders of broadcasting licences, and are required by the Telecommunications Act (Canada) (Telecommunications Act) and the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) issued pursuant to the Broadcasting Act (Canada) (Broadcasting Act) to be Canadian-owned and controlled. Under the Telecommunications Act, a Canadian carrier, such as TCI is considered to be Canadian-owned and controlled if:\n\n- (i) not less than 80% of the members of its board of directors are individual Canadians;\n- (ii) Canadians beneficially own not less than 80% of its voting interests; and\n- (iii)  it is not otherwise controlled in fact by persons who are not Canadians.\n\nSubstantially the same rules apply in relation to broadcasting undertakings but an additional requirement set out in the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) is that the chief executive officer of a company that is a licensed broadcasting undertaking must be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada. When levels of non-Canadian ownership exceed 20 per cent, an independent programming committee must be appointed to make all programming decisions relating to the licensed broadcasting undertaking.\n\nTELUS Corporation has filed with the CRTC the requisite documentation affirming TCI's status as a Canadian carrier. We further intend that TCI will remain controlled by TELUS Corporation and that it will remain 'Canadian' for the purposes of Canadian ownership requirements.\n\nThe Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations (Ownership and Control Regulations), made pursuant to the Telecommunications Act, further provide that in order for a company that holds shares in a carrier (carrier holding corporation) to be considered Canadian, not less than 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of that company must be beneficially owned by Canadians and that such company must not otherwise be controlled in fact by non-Canadians. To the best of our knowledge, Canadians beneficially own and control in the aggregate not less than 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of TELUS Corporation and TELUS Corporation is not otherwise controlled in fact by non-Canadians. For the purposes of these regulations, 'Canadian' means among other things:\n\n- (i) a Canadian citizen who is ordinarily resident in Canada;\n- (ii) a permanent resident of Canada who is ordinarily resident in Canada and has been so for not more than one year after the date he or she was eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship;\n- (iii)  a corporation with not less than 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of which are beneficially owned and controlled by Canadians and which is not otherwise controlled in fact by non-Canadians; or\n- (iv)  a pension fund society the majority of whose members of its board of directors are individual Canadians, and that is established under applicable federal legislation or any provincial legislation relating to the establishment of pension fund societies.\n\nThe Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) provides a similar definition of 'Canadian' but also includes a 'qualified corporation' which can be a subsidiary corporation whose parent corporation or its directors do not exercise control or influence over any programming decisions of the subsidiary corporation where\n\n- (a)  Canadians beneficially own and control less than 80% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the parent corporation and less than 80% of the votes,\n- (b)  the chief executive officer is a non-Canadian, or\n- (c)  less than 80% of the directors of the parent corporation are Canadian.\n\nOn August 10, 2017, in response to levels of foreign ownership of shares exceeding 20% and in order to meet the requirements of a 'qualified corporation' in accordance with the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) , the\n\n<!-- image -->",

For such purposes, in particular but without limitation, a company may, in accordance with the provisions contained in the Ownership and Control Regulations:\n\n- (i) refuse to accept any subscription for voting shares;\n- (ii) refuse to allow any transfer of voting shares to be recorded in its share register;\n- (iii)  suspend the rights of a holder of voting shares to vote at a meeting of its shareholders; and\n- (iv)  sell, repurchase or redeem excess voting shares.\n\nTo ensure that TELUS Corporation remains Canadian and that any subsidiary of TELUS Corporation, including TCI, is and continues to be eligible to operate as a Canadian carrier under the Telecommunications Act, to be issued radio authorizations under the Radiocommunication Act (Canada) (Radiocommunication Act), or to be issued broadcasting licences under the Broadcasting Act, provisions substantially similar to the foregoing have been incorporated into the Articles of TELUS Corporation permitting its directors to make determinations to effect any of the foregoing actions.\n\nIn addition, TELUS has systems in place to monitor the level of Canadian ownership of its Common Shares. For registered shareholders and shares trading on the TSX, a reservation and declaration system requires non-Canadian purchasers of Common Shares to obtain a reservation number from our transfer agent and registrar, Computershare Trust Company and to declare whether or not the purchaser is a Canadian or non-Canadian. For Common Shares trading on the NYSE, non-Canadian ownership is monitored by utilizing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's SEG-100 Account program. All TELUS Common Shares held by non-Canadians must be transferred to this account (no reservation application is required).\n\nThe Telecommunications Act was amended in June 2012 to remove foreign ownership restrictions for telecommunications common carriers that hold less than a 10% share of the total Canadian telecommunications services revenues. This change was made to enable non-Canadian owned entities to start up or acquire Canadian carriers that hold less than a 10% share of total Canadian telecommunications services revenues. However, given that TELUS and its affiliates exceed this 10% threshold, we remain subject to the pre-existing Canadian ownership and control restrictions outlined above. Canadian ownership requirements for licensees under the Broadcasting Act remain unchanged.\n\n## 7.3 Ratings\n\nThe following information relating to our credit ratings is provided as it relates to our financing costs, liquidity and operations. Additional information relating to credit ratings is contained in Section 7.5 - Liquidity and capital resource measures to Section 7.8 - Credit ratings in the 2022 annual MD&A.\n\nCredit ratings are important to our borrowing costs and ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing and the cost of such financing. Credit ratings are intended to provide investors with an independent measure of the credit quality of an issue of securities and are indicators of the likelihood of payment and of the capacity of a company to meet its financial commitment on the rated obligation in accordance with the terms of the rated obligation. A reduction in the current rating on our debt by rating agencies, particularly a downgrade below investment grade ratings or a negative change in ratings outlook which could result in a rating below investment grade could adversely affect our cost of financing and our access to sources of liquidity and capital. We believe our investment grade credit ratings, coupled with our efforts to maintain constructive relationships with banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continue to provide TELUS with reasonable access to capital markets. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including transactions involving over-the-counter derivatives. As at December 31, 2022, TCI is a party to an agreement expiring in December 2024, with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I bank, under which TCI is able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million. TCI is required to maintain at least a BB credit rating by DBRS Ltd. (DBRS) or the securitization trust may require the sale program to be wound down.\n\nThe rating agencies regularly evaluate TELUS and TCI, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the telecommunications industry generally, and the wider state of the economy. The Company's credit ratings are outlined in the chart below. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities and do not address the market price or suitability of a specific security for a particular investor. In addition, real or anticipated changes in the rating assigned to a security will generally affect the market value of that security. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be revised or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

That is, the risk that an issuer  will fail to satisfy its financial obligations in accordance with the terms under which an obligation has been  issued. Ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer, and the  relative ranking of claims. All rating categories, other than 'AAA' and 'D', also contain subcategories  '(high)' and '(low)'. The absence of either a '(high)' or '(low)' designation indicates the rating is in the  middle of the category.  A 'BBB' rating denotes adequate credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations  is considered acceptable. May be vulnerable to future events.   A DBRS rating trend provides guidance with respect to an opinion regarding the outlook for a rating.  The rating  trend  indicates  the  direction  a  rating  may  move  if  present  circumstances  continue  unless  addressed. A positive or negative trend represents an indication that there is a greater likelihood that the  rating could change in the future than is the case if a stable trend was assigned. Assignment of a positive  or negative trend are resolved typically within a twelve-month period. |\n| S&P           | A S&P issue credit rating is a forward-looking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect  to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a specific financial program  (including  ratings  on  medium-term  note  programs  and  commercial  paper  programs).  It  takes  into  consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit enhancement on the  obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. The opinion reflects  S&P's view of the obligor's capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due,  and may assess terms, such as collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate payment  in the event of default.  An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic  conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to  meet its financial commitment on the obligation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|               | Moody's long-term ratings are assigned to issuers or obligations with an original maturity of one year or  Obligations rated 'Baa' are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as  Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from 'Aa'  category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower  end of that generic rating category.

IDRs opine on an entity's  relative vulnerability to default on financial obligations. The 'threshold' default risk addressed by the IDR  is generally that of the financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the uncured failure of  that entity. As such, IDRs also address relative vulnerability to bankruptcy, administrative receivership or  similar concepts, although the agency recognizes that issuers may also make pre-emptive and therefore  voluntary use of such mechanisms. In aggregate, IDRs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on  the agency's view of their relative vulnerability to default, rather than a prediction of a specific percentage  likelihood of default.       'BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of  financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more  likely to impair this capacity.       The  modifiers '+'  or  '-'  may  be  appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating |\n\nAs of February 9, 2023, DBRS, S&P and Fitch rate TELUS as BBB (or equivalent) with a stable outlook, while Moody's rates TELUS as Baa1 with a negative outlook. As is common practice, during the last two years, each of the mentioned credit rating agencies charged TELUS for their rating services which include annual surveillance fees covering our outstanding long-term and short-term debt securities, in addition to one-time rating fees for certain agencies when debt is initially issued.

On December 1, 2022, the Court of King's Bench for Saskatchewan issued an Order approving a Proposal filed with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on October 21, 2022 and as accepted by requisite majorities of the creditors of Tron Construction & Mining Inc. (TCMI) and Tron Construction & Mining Limited Partnership (TCMLP), a 100% First Nation owned business. W.

In connection with such ownership, Mr. Willy is the Chair of TCMI.\n\nFor the 10 years ended February 9, 2023, we are not aware that any current director or executive officer of TELUS had been a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of any issuer which was the subject of a cease trade order, an order similar to a cease trade order or an order that denied such issuer access to any exemption under securities legislation, and that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, (in each such case, an 'Order') while that person was acting in that capacity, or was subject to such an Order issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer and resulted from an event that occurred while that person was acting in that capacity.\n\n## 10. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS\n\nLegal proceedings are described in Section 10.17 - Litigation and legal matters in the 2022 annual MD&A and in the Company's December 31, 2022, consolidated financial statements Note 29(a) Claims and lawsuits .\n\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are assessed fees or fines by securities regulatory authorities in relation to administrative matters, including late filing or reporting fees, which may be considered penalties or sanctions pursuant to Canadian securities regulations but which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous regulatory authorities around the world, and fees, administrative penalties, settlement agreements and sanctions may be categorized differently by each regulator. However, during the most recently completed financial year, the Company is not aware of any material (i) penalties or sanctions imposed against us by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority; (ii) penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body against us that would likely be considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision; or (iii) settlement agreements entered into by us before a court relating to securities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority.\n\n## 11. INTEREST OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there were no directors or executive officers, or any associate or affiliate of a director or executive officer with a material interest in any transaction within the three most recently completed financial years or during the current financial year that has materially affected or is reasonably expected to materially affect us.\n\n## 12.

Computershare maintains the Company's registers at 800, 324 - 8th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta T2P 2Z3.\n\n## 13. MATERIAL CONTRACTS\n\nTCI is a party to a three-year agreement (expiry December 31, 2024) with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I bank, under which TCI is able to sell an interest in certain of its trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million. TCI is required to maintain at least a BB credit rating by DBRS Ltd. or the securitization trust may require the sale program to be wound down. The necessary credit rating was exceeded throughout its term.\n\nTELUS holds a five-year unsecured credit facility (2018 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of financial institutions. On April 1, 2021, a second amendment agreement was entered into which extended the maturity date from May 2023 to April 2026 and increased the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. The 2018 Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes including the backstop of commercial paper.\n\nOn July 12, 2022, TELUS entered into an unsecured non-revolving $1.9 billion bank credit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes.  Subsequently, the size of the facility, upon our request, was reduced to $1.6 billion.\n\nTELUS has also entered into material contracts in connection with the following financings in 2022:\n\n<!-- image -->",

To enable this, we have implemented a process by which all requests for services involving the external auditor are routed for review by the VP Risk Management and Chief Internal Auditor to validate that the requested service is a non-prohibited service and to verify that there is a compelling business reason for the request. If the request passes this review, it is then forwarded to the Chief Financial Officer for further review. Pending the Chief Financial Officer's affirmation, the request is then presented to the Audit Committee for its review, evaluation and pre-approval or denial at its next scheduled quarterly meeting. If the timing of the request is urgent, it is provided to the Audit Committee Chair for his or her review, evaluation and pre-approval or denial on behalf of the Audit Committee (with the full committee's review at the next scheduled quarterly meeting). Throughout the year, the Audit Committee monitors the actual versus approved expenditure for each of the approved requests.\n\nThe following table is a summary of billings by Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), as external auditor of TELUS, during each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                       | Year ended December 31, 2022   | Year ended December 31, 2022   | Year ended December 31, 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Type of work          | $ millions                     | %                              | $ millions                     | %                              |\n| Audit fees  1         | 3.125                          | 27.4                           | 2.810                          | 25.8                           |\n| Audit-related fees  2 | 7.230                          | 63.3                           | 6.869                          | 63.2                           |\n| Tax fees  3           | 870                            | 7.6                            | 0.834                          | 7.7                            |\n| All other fees  4     | 192                            | 1.7                            | 0.359                          | 3.3                            |\n| Total                 | 11.417                         | 100.0                          | 10.871                         | 100.0                          |\n\n## 16.
