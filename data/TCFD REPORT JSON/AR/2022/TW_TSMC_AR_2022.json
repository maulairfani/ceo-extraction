        "page_content": "## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe year 2022 was a landmark year for TSMC. Supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we delivered a thirteenth-consecutive year of record revenue, with strong profitable growth. Our 2022 annual revenue increased 33.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, while our EPS rose to NT$39.20, nearly tripling over the past three years.\n\nThese achievements were earned in the face of considerable economic, human and geopolitical challenges across the world. The year started with continued COVID-19 lockdowns, conflict in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions that severely disrupted global supply chains. Retreat of globalization and free trade fueled inflationary pressure around the world, increased macroeconomic uncertainty, and impacted consumer confidence. In the second half of the year, pandemic-related demand, such as remote working and remote learning, receded as many parts of the world began to re-open, and the semiconductor industry entered an inventory correction mode.\n\nThe world also began to focus more intently on the importance of the semiconductor industry, as it suddenly recognized the critical role semiconductors play in a modern economy. The rising tensions in geopolitics also accentuated the attention on a resilient semiconductor supply chain, and the key role it plays in their economic and national infrastructure security.\n\nFor TSMC, we continued to focus on the fundamentals of our business. We enriched our R&D intensity and worked diligently on our technology development, especially 2-nanometer, to deliver full node strides in performance and power benefits to our customers, while offering the industry's most advanced transistor scaling. We also increased our productivity and fab operations quality, while successfully bringing our industry-leading 3-nanometer to high volume manufacturing in 4Q'22. We deepened our service and expanded our capacity to support our customers' growth, further earning their trust, as evidenced by higher scores in our annual customer survey. We enhanced our cybersecurity systems and measures continuously, to rigorously protect customers' IP and our proprietary information. As we entered our third year of digital transformation, we accelerated the pace to keep our employees connected and productive in a flexible work environment, while protecting them from COVID infection with stringent anti-pandemic measures.\n\nDespite the recent macroeconomic uncertainties around the world, the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains strong, underpinned by the industry's multi-year megatrends of 5G and High Performance Computing (HPC)-related applications. Therefore, we continuously work closely with our customers in a disciplined manner to plan our capacity, based on the long-term market demand profile, and investing in leading edge and specialty technologies, to support their structural growth.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions have arisen in different parts of the world, our customers also start to value more geographic manufacturing flexibility, in addition to technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, low cost and trust of service quality.\n\nUnder this environment, based on customers' request, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint, to increase customer trust, to expand our future growth opportunities, and to reach for global talents.\n\nIn Taiwan, our N3 has just entered volume production in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing for N2 volume production starting in 2025, which will be located in Hsinchu and Taichung Science Parks.\n\nIn the U.S., we are in the process of building two advanced semiconductor fabs in Arizona, with N4 and N3 process technology, respectively. We are also building a 12-inch specialty technology fab in Kumamoto, Japan.\n\nThese investment decisions are based on our customers' needs in each region, and a necessary level of government support. We believe this is a necessary step to maximize value for our shareholders.\n\nOur pricing will remain strategic to reflect our value, which also includes the value of geographic manufacturing flexibility. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our competitive advantages of large volume, economies of scale and manufacturing technology leadership, to continuously drive costs lower. We will also continue to work closely with all the regional governments, to secure their support.\n\nCombining such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher costs of overseas fabs, while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer, no matter where we operate. Thus, even as we increase our capacity outside of Taiwan, we can continue to earn a sustainable and healthy return, while delivering long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.\n\nTo address the insatiable demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC not only for reliable capacity, but also a predictable cadence of technology development.\n\nWe continued to extend our technology leadership, as our 3-nanometer technology entered volume production in 2022, and is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology.\n\nWe are building a strong foundation for the next generation technology to follow. N2 technology development is on track, with risk production scheduled in 2024 and volume production in 2025. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced.\n\nHighlights of TSMC's accomplishments in 2022:\n\n- \u25cf   Total wafer shipments were 15.3 million 12-inch equivalent wafers as compared to 14.2 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2021.\n- \u25cf   Advanced technologies (7-nanometer and beyond) accounted for 53 percent of total wafer revenue, up from 50 percent in 2021.\n- \u25cf   We deployed 288 distinct process technologies, and manufactured 12,698 products for 532 customers.\n- \u25cf   TSMC produced 30 percent of the world semiconductor excluding memory output value in 2022, as compared to 26 percent in the previous year.\n\n## 2022 Financial Performance\n\nConsolidated revenue reached NT$2,263.89 billion, an increase of 42.6 percent over NT$1,587.42 billion in 2021.

        "page_content": "TSMC generated net income of US$34.07 billion on consolidated revenue of US$75.88 billion, which increased 59.6 percent and 33.5 percent respectively from the 2021 level of US$21.35 billion net income and US$56.82 billion consolidated revenue.\n\nGross profit margin was 59.6 percent as compared with 51.6 percent in 2021, while operating profit margin was 49.5 percent compared with 40.9 percent a year earlier. Net profit margin was 44.9 percent, an increase of 7.3 percentage points from 2021's 37.6 percent.\n\nIn 2022, the Company further raised its total cash dividend payments to NT$11.0 per share, up from NT$10.25 a year ago.\n\n## Technological Developments\n\nIn 2022, we continued to increase our investment in R&D to US$5.47 billion to extend our technology leadership and differentiation. We also work closely with our customers to enable the global pool of innovators, to unleash their innovations and create greater value for the semiconductor industry.\n\nIn its third year of ramp, our 5-nanometer family of technologies contributed 26% of TSMC's revenue. We continued to enhance our N5 family's performance, power and density, and N4 started volume production in 2022. We also introduced N4P and N4X technologies, targeting next wave 5nm products. N4P technology development is well on track, and volume production is scheduled in 2023. N4X is TSMC's first HPC-focused, workload-intensive technology, with customers' product tape-outs in 2023.\n\nAfter N3 technology entered volume production in 2022, N3E will further extend our N3 family, with enhanced performance, power, and yield. Volume production of N3E is scheduled for 2H'23. We are working on a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E, with the number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in its first and second year. We expect our N3 family to be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.\n\nOur 2-nanometer technology will adopt nanosheet transistor structure, and deliver full-node performance and power efficiency gains, with 10-15% speed improvement at the same power or 25-30% power improvement at the same speed as compared to N3E, to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. N2 will provide our customers with the best performance, cost and technology maturity, and extend our technology leadership position well into the future.\n\nAs TSMC pushes the envelope of transistor scaling, we also continue to expand our TSMC 3DFabric TM design solutions, as another dimension to improve system-level performance. TSMC 3DFabric TM consists of both wafer-level 3D and advanced packaging technologies. For our 3D technologies, TSMC-SoIC \u00ae Chip-on-Wafer (CoW) technology successfully entered volume production in 2022, demonstrating significant performance improvement by stacking SRAM chips on logic wafers. TSMC-SoIC \u00ae Wafer-on-Wafer (WoW) technology demonstrated superb system performance enhancement for HPC products in 2022 by stacking 7nm logic wafer on deep trench capacitor wafer. For our advanced packaging technologies, the CoWoS \u00ae -S technology that integrates multiple system-on-chip (SoC) chips, high bandwidth memory stacks, and a 3-reticle size silicon interposer successfully entered volume production for customer HPC products in 2022. For InFO advanced packaging technology, TSMC successfully entered volume production of Integrated Fan-Out on Substrate (InFO\\_oS) that integrates multiple SoC chips in a 2-reticle size fan-out package.\n\nTo help customers unleash their product innovations with fast time-to-market, TSMC provides customers with comprehensive infrastructure needed to optimize design productivity and cycle times.

        "page_content": "## 2.1 An Introduction to TSMC\n\nEstablished in 1987 and headquartered in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, TSMC pioneered the pure-play foundry business model with an exclusive focus on manufacturing its customers' products. By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes with its customers. Based on this founding principle, the key to TSMC's success has always been to enable its customers' success. TSMC's foundry business model has led to the rise of the global fabless industry, and, since its inception, TSMC has been one of the world's leading semiconductor foundries. In 2022, the Company manufactured 12,698 different products using 288 distinct technologies for 532 different customers.\n\nTSMC-made semiconductors serve a global customer base that is large and diverse entailing a wide range of applications. These products are used in a variety of end markets including high performance computing, smartphones, the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Such strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which in turn allows TSMC to maintain high levels of capacity utilization and profitability, and generate healthy returns for future investment.\n\nThe annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 15 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2022. These facilities include four 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB\u00ae fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab - all in Taiwan - as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.\n\nIn December 2022, TSMC announced that, in addition to TSMC Arizona's first fab, which is scheduled to begin production of N4 process technology in 2024, the Company has also started the construction of a second fab in Arizona to begin production of 3nm process technology in 2026. The overall investment for these two facilities will be approximately US$40 billion. When completed, TSMC Arizona's two fabs will manufacture over 600,000 wafers per year, with estimated end-product value of more than US$40 billion. At the same time, the Company continues to execute its plan for a fab in Kumamoto, Japan, with production targeted for 2024.\n\nTSMC provides customer support, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea. At the end of 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries employed more than 73,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) under ticker number 2330, and its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TSM.\n\n## 2.2 Market/Business Summary\n\n## 2.2.1 TSMC Achievements\n\nIn 2022, TSMC maintained its leading position in the foundry segment of the global semiconductor industry by accounting for 30% of the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory, an increase from 26% in 2021. TSMC's growth was mainly driven by the continued expansion of 5G and high performance computing (HPC)-related applications.\n\nThe Company's strong market position stems in great part from its leadership in advanced process technologies. In 2022, 53% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from advanced manufacturing processes - defined as geometries of 7nm and smaller - up from 50% in 2021.\n\nTSMC offers comprehensive technology portfolio and continues to invest in advanced technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and silicon stacking technologies, to provide customers more added value.\n\nIn addition to its leadership in advanced process and specialty technologies, TSMC offers TSMC 3DFabric TM , a comprehensive family of 3D silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies to complement its process technology offerings. TSMC 3DFabric TM provides customers greater chip design flexibility to unleash innovation and is another differentiating competitive advantage for the Company.\n\n## 2.2.2 Market Overview\n\nTSMC estimates that the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory reached US$492 billion in revenue in 2022, representing a 10% increase from 2021. In the foundry segment of the semiconductor industry, total revenue rose to US$130 billion in 2022, a robust growth of 28% over 2021.\n\n## 2.2.3 Industry Outlook, Opportunities and Threats\n\n## Foundry Industry Demand and Supply Outlook\n\nIn 2022, TSMC's solid growth in the foundry segment was fueled by strong, broad based market demand. Industry megatrends, such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, and the accelerating digital transformation, drove increased demand across all major markets: smartphones, high performance computing, Internet of Things, and automotive. However, the electronics supply chain was also carrying high levels of excess inventory, accumulated over the past two years due to supply uncertainties. Hence, in the second half of 2022, the electronics supply chain entered an inventory correction period, which impacted the foundry segment and TSMC growth.\n\nLooking ahead, TSMC expects the inventory correction to continue into 2023, primarily in the first half of the year. Furthermore, concerns about inflation and slowing economic growth will likely have a dampening impact on discretionary consumer spending, reducing overall demand for electronic devices. Against these two headwinds, TSMC projects mid-single-digit decline for the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory in 2023. For the longer term, driven by increasing semiconductor content in most electronic devices, continued market segment share gains by fabless companies, increases in integrated device manufacturer (IDM) outsourcing, and the expanding use of in-house applicationspecific integrated circuits (ASIC) by systems companies, TSMC expects foundry segment revenue to outpace the midsingle-digit compound annual growth rate projected for the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory from 2022 through 2027.\n\nAs an upstream supplier in the semiconductor supply chain, the foundry segment is tightly correlated with the market health of all major platforms including smartphones, HPC, the IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics (DCE).\n\n## \u25cf Smartphones\n\nDue to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war and generally higher inflation, smartphone unit shipments declined 11% in 2022, reflecting a slowdown in the pace of 5G commercialization and thus prolonging the replacement of 4G. As this situation is likely to persist, TSMC projects a continued low-single-digit decline for the smartphone market in 2023. Over the longer term,\n\nhowever, the inevitable migration to 5G, together with improved performance, longer battery life, biosensors and more AI features, will all continue to propel smartphone sales going forward.\n\nHigh performance and power efficient IC technologies are essential requirements among handset manufacturers, and highly integrated chips and advanced 3D packaging designs are the preferred solutions to optimize cost, power and form factor (IC footprint and thickness). The migration to advanced process technologies will certainly continue spurred by the need for higher performance chips to run AI applications and various complex software computations as well as higher resolution video. TSMC is an acknowledged leader in process technology for manufacturing highly integrated chips and advanced 3D packaging designs and as such is very well positioned to serve the evolving smartphone market.\n\n## \u25cf  High Performance Computing (HPC)\n\nThe HPC platform includes PCs, tablets, game consoles, servers, base stations and more. Major HPC unit shipments declined 11% in 2022 due to prolonged high inflation, macro-economic uncertainty and inventory overbuilt, all resulting in weak demand on the consumer side. Meanwhile, the server and data center upgrade cycle remained relatively healthy to accommodate rapidly growing data traffic and to fulfill the expanding needs of AI applications and continued 5G base station deployment.\n\nAlthough the trend toward accelerated digitalization stimulated by the COVID-19 pandemic has induced a structural increase in HPC-related semiconductor demand, the economic headwinds cited above will increasingly dampen demand on both consumer and enterprise sides and, as a result, TSMC projects another year of low teens decline in HPC unit shipments in 2023. Longer term, an increasingly intelligent and more connected 5G world will fuel massive requirements for computation power as well as a great need for energy-efficient computing. These require higher performance and more power-efficient CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, AI accelerators, and related-ASICs, which will drive the overall HPC platform towards richer silicon content, more advanced process technologies and advanced 3D packaging. These trends are all favorable to TSMC given our technology leadership in these areas.",

        "page_content": "## \u25cf Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe IoT platform includes various types of 'smart' connected devices ranging from wearables, health monitors and speakers to home automation devices, city and manufacturing automation devices. As the COVID-19 pandemic changed individual life and work styles and accelerated the digital transformation in enterprises, IoT unit shipments grew 18% in 2022, with smart health devices, smart retail, and smart manufacturing as the major growth drivers.\n\nWhile these trends remain strong, TSMC believes demand for consumer-related IoT devices will be somewhat tempered by high inflation and projects unit shipment growth in the low teens in 2023. Overall, as IoT devices take on more AI functions, they will require higher performance but lower power controllers, connectivity ICs and various types of sensors. TSMC offers the industry's most advanced technologies in these areas including ultra-low power (ULP) and various specialty process technologies to help customers meet demand, fulfill ESG requirements and succeed in the marketplace\n\n## \u25cf Automotive\n\nWith generally improving chip availability, worldwide car unit sales grew 7% in 2022 but was still held back by supply chain disruptions caused by the Russo-Ukrainian war and sporadic lockdowns due to the spread of COVID-19 particularly in China. The ongoing headwinds of high inflation and macro-economic uncertainty are expected to hold global car unit sales to low-single-digit growth in 2023 as well.\n\nThe entire automotive industry is moving toward 'greener, safer and smarter,' which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and smart cockpit/infotainment systems, along with new electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture. All these will lead to increased demand for AP/MCU/ASIC processors, in-car networking, sensors, and power management ICs, thus continuously increasing the silicon content per car. TSMC offers a wide variety of relevant process technologies to enable customers to deliver competitive products in the automotive market.\n\n## \u25cf Digital Consumer Electronics (DCE)\n\nLogistical disruptions such as port congestion led to prolonged lead times in the TV supply chain causing major electronics retailers to over-order and create excess inventory in 2022. At the same time, inflation, rate hikes and the China lockdown due to its zero-COVID policy weakened demand for TVs, set-top boxes (STB) and other consumer products. As a result, the total DCE market fell by 11% in 2022.\n\nWhile some high-end areas such as large screen, 120Hz/144Hz high frame rate TV, voice AI control and WiFi 6 connectivity will continue to show good growth, fears of economic recession may stifle overall recovery. As a result, TSMC forecasts a low-single-digit decline in global DCE unit shipments in 2023. Regardless of the timing of the recovery, TSMC advanced technologies will continue to enable DCE customers to create and differentiate their innovative products.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nThe electronics industry features a long and complex supply chain, the elements of which are correlated and highly interdependent. At the upstream manufacturing level, IC vendors need to have sufficient, flexible supply deliveries to handle fluctuating demand dynamics. Foundry vendors play an important role in maintaining the health and effectiveness of the supply chain. As a leader in the foundry segment, TSMC provides advanced technologies and large-scale capacity to complement and support the innovations created in the downstream chain.\n\n## 2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy\n\n## Position\n\nTSMC is a global semiconductor foundry leader in advanced, specialty and advanced packaging technologies. In 2022, TSMC accounted for 30% of the worldwide semiconductor market excluding memory, an increase from 26% in 2021.

According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than the other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\nNote 2: Pensions funded according to applicable law.\n\nNote 3:  The above-mentioned figures include expenses for Company cars and related reimbursements, but do not include compensation paid to Company drivers (totaled NT$5,205,050). Note 4:  Total remuneration paid to the directors from TSMC and from all consolidated entities in 2021, including their employee compensation, both accounted for 0.1521% of 2021 net income.",

We believe that the basis for successful corporate governance is a sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, TSMC Board of Directors set up the 'Audit Committee' and the 'Compensation Committee' in 2002 and 2003 respectively. To continue to make our corporate governance more comprehensive, the TSMC Board took a step further in February 2023 to expand and strengthen the functions and responsibilities of its committees, including renaming the 'Audit Committee' to the 'Audit and Risk Committee', and the renaming the 'Compensation Committee' to the 'Compensation and People Development Committee'. In addition, in order to strengthen the selection mechanism for directors, build diversified and professional board, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the establishment of the 'Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee' referencing international practices. Each Committee supports the Board to fulfill its responsibilities and each Committee's chairperson regularly reports to the Board on its activities and recommendations.\n\n## 2022 Corporate Governance Awards and Ratings\n\n| Organization                            | Awards                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) | Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 22 nd  consecutive year Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index                                                           |\n| MSCI ESG Indexes                        | MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index component  MSCI ESG Research - AAA Ratings MSCI ACWI SRI Index component MSCI ACWI Islamic Index component MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Leaders Index |\n| Sustainalytics                          | Company ESG Risk Ratings: Low ESG Risk - Semiconductor Industry                                                                                                                |\n| ISS ESG                                 | 'Prime' Rated by ISS ESG Corporate Rating                                                                                                                                      |\n| FTSE4Good Index                         | FTSE4Good Emerging Index component FTSE4Good All-World Index component                                                                                                         |\n| Corporate Knights                       | 2022 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Semiconductor Company Top 100                                                                                                    |\n| Taiwan Stock Exchange                   | Top 5% in Corporate Governance Evaluation of Listed Companies for the 8 th  consecutive year                                                                                   |\n| CommonWealth Magazine                   | Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award - Honorable Legion of Corporate Sustainability Semiconductor Company Top 100                                               |\n| Institutional Investor Magazine         | Most Honored Company (Technology/Semiconductors) - All-Asia Best Overall ESG (Technology/Semiconductors) - 1 st  Place (buy-side and sell-side) - All-Asia                     |\n| Forbes                                  | The World's Top 10 Largest Technology Companies in 2022 World's Best Employers                                                                                                 |\n| FORTUNE                                 | 2022 World's Most Admired Companies Fortune Global 500                                                                                                                         |\n| Asiamoney                               | 2022 Asia's Outstanding Companies - Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment Sector for the 5 th  consecutive year                                                             |\n| Taiwan Institute of Sustainable Energy  | Taiwan Top 10 Sustainability Exemplary Awards for the 7 th  consecutive year                                                                                                   |\n| IFI Claims Patent Services              | Ranked as 3 rd  in 2022 Top 50 US Patent Assignees                                                                                                                             |\n\n## 3.2 Board of Directors\n\n## Board Structure\n\nTSMC's Board of Directors consists of ten distinguished members with a great breadth of experience as world-class business leaders or professionals. We deeply rely on them for their diverse knowledge, personal perspectives, and solid business judgment. Six of those ten members are Independent Directors: former British Telecommunications Chief Executive Officer, Sir Peter L. Bonfield; former Chairman of National Performing Arts Center and former Advisor of Executive Yuan, R.O.C., Ms. Kok-Choo Chen; former Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., Mr. Michael R. Splinter; former Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx, Inc., Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov; currently Chairman of Delta Electronics Inc., Mr. Yancey Hai; and former President of MIT, Mr. L. Rafael Reif.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTSMC's Board is comprised of a diverse group of professionals from different backgrounds in industries, academia, law, etc. These professionals include citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experience, one of whom is female. Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board.\n\n## Board Responsibilities\n\nInheriting the spirit of TSMC's Founder, Dr. Morris Chang's philosophy on corporate governance, under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Board of Directors takes a serious and forthright approach to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and independent Board.\n\nThe Board's primary duty is to supervise the Company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations, financial transparency, timely disclosure of material information, and maintaining of the highest integrity. TSMC's Board of Directors strives to perform these responsibilities through its Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, the hiring of a financial expert consultant for the Audit Committee, and coordination with our Internal Audit department.\n\nThe second duty of the Board of Directors is to appoint and dismiss officers of the Company when necessary, to evaluate the management's performance and to review the succession plan for senior executives. TSMC's management has maintained a healthy and functional communication with the Board of Directors, has been devoted in executing guidance of the Board, and is dedicated in running the business operations, all to achieve the best interests for TSMC shareholders.\n\nThe third duty of the Board of Directors is to resolve critical matters, such as capital appropriations, investment activities, dividends, etc.",

        "page_content": "The fourth duty of the Board of Directors is to provide guidance to the Company's management team and risk management. In each quarter, TSMC's management reports to the Board on various subjects (including ESG programs) and strategies, and spends substantial time and effort to communicate with the Board. The Board would comment on the risk and probabilities for success of the proposed corporate strategies. The Board also periodically oversees those strategies' implementation and outcomes, and may suggest the management team to make adjustments to the strategic goals and objectives if necessary.\n\n## Nomination and Election of Directors\n\nTSMC envisions the membership of its esteemed Board of Directors to be composed of highly ethical professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience as world-class business leaders and understanding from diverse backgrounds. TSMC has establishes the 'Guidelines for Nomination of Directors' that set out the procedures and criteria for the nomination, qualification and evaluation of Director candidates to be nominated by the Board of Directors, and provide that 'Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee' will propose independent director candidates to the Board of Directors. The independence of each independent director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant laws.\n\nDirectors shall be elected pursuant to the candidate nomination system specified in Article 192-1 of the R.O.C. Company Law. The tenure of office for Directors shall be three years. The independence of each independent director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant law such as the Taiwan 'Regulations Governing Appointment of Independent Directors and Compliance Matters for Public Companies'. Under R.O.C. law, in which TSMC was incorporated, any shareholders holding one percent or more of our total outstanding common shares may nominate their own candidate to stand for election as a Board member. This democratic mechanism allows our shareholders to become involved in the selection and nomination process of Board candidates. The final slate of candidates is put to the shareholders for voting at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting.\n\nThere are no limits on the number of terms that a director may serve. We believe the Company benefits from the contributions of directors who have over their years of dedicated service acquired unique insights into the operations and financial developments of the Company. The Company reviews the appropriateness of each director's continued service to ensure there are new viewpoints available to the Board.\n\n## Directors' Compensation\n\nAccording to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account the extent and value of the services provided for the management of the Corporation and the standards of the industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also state that not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits may be distributed as compensation to our directors. In addition, directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive any director compensation. According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\n## Directors' Professional Qualifications and Independent Directors' Independence Status\n\n| Criteria Name/Title                        | Professional Qualification and Experience                                                                                                                                                                                         | Independent Directors' Independence Status                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   Number of Other  Taiwanese Public  Companies Concurrently  Serving as an Independent  Director |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark Liu Chairman                          | For Directors' professional qualification and  experience, please refer to '2.4.1 Information  Annual Report.

The members of TSMC Board of Directors are nominated via rigorous selection processes. It not only considers background diversity, professional competence and experience, but also attaches great importance to his/her personal reputation on ethics and leadership. The Company aims to have at least of 50% independent directors and at least one female director to serve on the Board. Presently, the ten members of the Board of Directors represent diversified perspectives, including a complementary mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds such as that from the industry, academia, and in law. These professionals, including a female board member, are citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experiences. The six Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board, and there is no marital or is within the second degree of kinship relationship between or among the Directors. As such, the Board of Directors carries independence.

TSMC strictly adheres to the highest standards of integrity and promotes good ethical behavior to sustain the hard-earned trust and confidence of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and the general public - constantly and vigilantly promoting integrity, fairness, and transparency in all that we say and do. We have zero tolerance for corruption, refrain from bribery, fraud, abuse or embezzlement of corporate assets, and prohibit the advancement of personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with TSMC. At the heart of our corporate governance culture is the 'TSMC Ethics and Business Conduct Policy' (Ethics Code). The Ethics Code requires that each employee bear a heavy personal responsibility to preserve and to protect TSMC's ethical values and reputation. At the same time, we have formulated the 'TSMC's Supplier Code of Conduct' as well to ensure our suppliers understand and follow the Ethics Code and together fulfill our corporate social responsibilities.\n\nSpecifically, every TSMC employee must adhere to the following:\n\n- \u25cf  Do not advance personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with the Company;\n- \u25cf  Refrain from corruption (including collusion with others), bribery, unfair competition, fraud, extortion, embezzlement, and waste or abuse of corporate assets;\n- \u25cf  Avoid any improper efforts to influence the decisions of anyone, including government officials, agencies, as well as TSMC's customers and suppliers;\n- \u25cf  Do not undertake any practices detrimental to TSMC, to the environment, or to society;\n- \u25cf  Procure all of our raw materials from socially responsible sources;\n- \u25cf  Protect proprietary information of TSMC, our customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf  Abide by the letter of all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe protection of intellectual properties is also an important part of the Ethics Code. In order to build and sustain an environment of innovation, technology leadership, and sustainable profitable growth, the Ethics Code requires that TSMC promotes business relationships founded upon an unwavering respect for the intellectual property rights, proprietary information and trade secrets of TSMC, our customers, and others.\n\nWith regarding to public disclosures, TSMC's officers, especially our CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, with oversight from our Board, are responsible for the full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable financial accounting and financial disclosure in reports and documents filed by the Company with securities authorities and in all TSMC public communications and disclosures. TSMC has a variety of measures in place to ensure compliance with these disclosure obligations.\n\nAny modification to the Ethics Code requires the approval of our Audit Committee to ensure our ethics compliance program is independently reviewed against corporate best practices.\n\n## Ethics Code Implementation\n\nHigh Standard of Ethics Culture: Our ethics program is implemented in four ways by all of TSMC's Board members, officers, and employees. First, the TSMC management team sets the 'tone from top' by acting in accordance with the Ethics Code so that they will be an example to all stakeholders. Second, working-level managers are responsible for ensuring their staff's understanding of and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Third, TSMC encourages an environment of open communications in discussing any questions related to the Ethics Code. Any employee may consult his or her direct supervisors, Human Resources or Legal to obtain timely advice. Lastly, TSMC requires all employees to stay vigilant and report any noncompliance by anyone to their supervisors, the function head of Human Resources, the responsible corporate senior management appointed by CEO that oversees the Ombudsman system, or to the Chairman of the Company's Audit Committee directly.\n\nSelf-Assessment of All Departments and Employees: Self-assessment of all departments and employees is an important part of our ethics compliance program. All TSMC departments and subsidiaries are required to conduct Control Self-Assessment (CSA) tests annually in reviewing employees' awareness of the Ethics Code, and to evaluate and strengthen the effectiveness of internal control related to the Ethics Code. The CSA results are reviewed to track the results of our compliance program. In addition, all employees must disclose any matters that cause, or may cause, actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition to this proactive disclosure requirement, employees with specific job grades or job responsibilities must annually declare any relationships that may constitute a conflict of interest, which enables TSMC to take necessary arrangements and report the results to the Audit Committee.\n\nInternal Auditing: The Internal Auditor of TSMC plays a critical role in ensuring the Company's compliance with the Ethics Code and relevant rules and regulations. To ensure that our financial, managerial, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely and that our employees' actions are in compliance with applicable policies, standards, procedures, laws and regulations, our Internal Auditor conducts audits of various control points within the Company in accordance with its annual audit plan approved by the Board of Directors and subsequently reports its audit findings and remedial issues to the Board and management on a regular basis.\n\nTraining and Promotion: To promote awareness to our employees of their responsibilities under the Ethics Code, we publish our Ethics Code and related policies and documents on our intranet and, provide training courses, posters, emails, and other diversified ways to advocate the Company's core values and compliance system. In terms of training courses, TSMC not only provides annual online course on the Ethics Code and requires all employees to complete the training, as well as face-to-face training courses delving into more specific ethics-related topics for targeted employees. In 2022, there were 67,922 attendances that completed the'Annual Ethics and Compliance Training Course' (mandatory 0.5 hour online course) at TSMC and its subsidiaries, reaching 99.9% completion rate.",

        "page_content": "In addition to our internal compliance efforts, we expect and assist our business partners such as customers and suppliers, and any other entities with whom we deal (include consultants or third party agents who act for or on behalf of TSMC) to recognize and understand TSMC's ethical standards to fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen. For instance, we require all of our suppliers to declare in writing that they will respect and comply with TSMC's ethical standards and culture. TSMC is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA, formerly the (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, EICC)), dedicated to global supply chain sustainability. In addition to adopting the RBA Code of Conduct at all of its facilities, TSMC applied the RBA's standards to enhance our audit program of our suppliers and relevant business partners. We provide training and communicate our ethical culture to our suppliers through live seminars and online programs to prevent any unethical conduct and detect any sign of Ethics Code violations. In 2022, we held a sustainable supply chain ESH forum to share/exchange practical experiences on topics such as the Ethics Code, environmental protection, and occupational safety. We also exchange views on appropriate business conduct and TSMC's ethical standards and implementation status with our customers as part of customer audit programs.\n\n## Reporting Channels and Whistleblower Protection\n\nTSMC has established and published its 'Complaint Policy and Procedure for Certain Accounting & Legal Matters' and pledges to comply with the relevant regulations in the policy. Open and multiple reporting channels are available for internal and external voices to protect the rights and interests of stakeholders and the Company. All reported incidents collected from reporting channels inside or outside of TSMC are properly recorded and traced. TSMC also prohibits any form of retaliation by providing proper protection for any individual who in good faith reports a suspected violation or participates in an investigation. In 2022, the Ethics Committee held a total six meetings to examine major reported incidents under investigation.\n\nTSMC investigates each individual case according to its characteristics through specific divisions, and treats every received case seriously, carefully, and effectively to ensure the accuracy of the investigation. The TSMC Ethics Committee will evaluate each case to determine whether it is an exceptional case or whether it results from systemic issues of insufficient awareness in ethics. This allows TSMC to continue evaluating whether it is necessary to improve its management and internal control procedures. Awareness such as emails to employees describing the violations and disciplinary actions in each quarter are conducted to promote employees' awareness and avoid recurrence of similar incidents.\n\nIn 2022, TSMC did not receive any reports related to finance, accounting or antitrust matters, nor did we receive any complaints concerning breach of customer privacy and loss of customer data, or any material regulatory violations (where a fine exceeds NT$1 million), including non-monetary sanctions.\n\nIn 2022, the incidents reported through the Audit Committee Whistleblower System, Ombudsman System, and Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System totaled 335. Among them, 217 cases were related to people management/employee relations, 107 cases were categorized as others (e.g., asking personal questions or private matters), and 11 cases were related to ethics. Four incidents were verified upon investigation and determined for disciplinary action by the Ethics Committee. In 2022, TSMC leveraged the four violations to strengthen ethics promotion for all employees in supplier-related activities. Below is a summary of reported incidents.\n\n| Year                                                 |   FY2018 |   FY2019 |   FY2020 |   FY2021 | FY2022      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Total reported cases                                 |      150 |      205 |      246 |      327 | 335         |\n| Ethics-related cases                                 |       14 |       26 |       22 |       17 | 11          |\n| Cases investigated and verified as ethics violations |        1 |        2 |        6 |        4 | 4 (Note 1)  |\n| Sexual Harassment Investigation Committees Formed    |        3 |        4 |        4 |       14 | 19          |\n| Cases investigated and verified as violations        |        3 |        4 |        2 |       11 | 14 (Note 2) |\n\n## Ethics Code Violation Disciplinary Action\n\nWe do not tolerate any violation of the Ethics Code and treat every possible violation incident seriously. Each violator of the Ethics Code (or relevant regulations) will be severely disciplined to the full extent of our policies and the law, up to and including immediate dismissal, termination of business relationship, and judicial prosecution as appropriate.\n\n## 3.5.1  Taiwan Corporate Conduct and Ethics Implementation as Required by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission\n\n|

Each year going forward, TSMC will designate employees from different departments to take insider trading on-line program to strengthen employees' awareness and compliance with insider trading laws.",

TSMC's Board of Directors and management are responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an adequate internal control system. Internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations (including profitability, performance and safeguarding of assets), reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of our reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 2.  An internal control system has inherent limitations. No matter how perfectly designed, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of accomplishing its stated objectives. Moreover, the effectiveness of an internal control system may be subject to changes due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control. Nevertheless, our internal control system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and TSMC takes immediate remedial actions in response to any identified deficiencies.\n- 3.  TSMC evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system based on the criteria provided in the Regulations Governing the Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies (herein below, the 'Regulations'). The criteria adopted by the Regulations identify five key components of managerial internal control: (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) monitoring activities. Each component also includes several items which can be found in the Regulations.\n- 4.  TSMC has evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system according to the aforesaid Regulations.\n- 5.  Based on the findings of such evaluation, TSMC believes that, on December 31, 2022, it has maintained, in all material respects, an effective internal control system (that includes the supervision and management of our subsidiaries), to provide reasonable assurance over our operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 6.  This Statement is an integral part of TSMC's annual report and prospectus, and will be made public. Any falsehood, concealment, or other illegality in the content made public will entail legal liability under Articles 20, 32, 171, and 174 of the Securities and Exchange Law.\n- 7.  This Statement was passed by the Board of Directors in their meeting held on February 14, 2023, with none of the ten attending directors expressing dissenting opinions, and the remainder all affirming the content of this Statement.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Liu,\n\nChairman\n\nC.C.

This is mainly due to a portion of audit fees, NT$14,450 thousand, were actually paid in January 2023. If such payment is included, the total audit fees in 2022 will be higher than last year.\n\nNote 2: The fees were mainly related to the bond offering that was borne by the underwriter and audit of annual income tax returns.",

If the actual amounts subsequently paid differ from the above estimated amounts, the differences will be recorded in the year paid as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n## 2022 Directors' Compensation and Employees' Profit Sharing\n\n|                                  | Board Resolution (02/14/2023) Amount (NT$ thousands)   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Directors' Compensation (Cash)   | 690,128                                                |\n| Employee's Profit Sharing (Cash) | 60,702,047                                             |\n\nNote:  NT$60,702,047 thousand business performance bonus was already distributed following each quarter of 2022.

However, due to employee turnover, the employees' profit sharing in the amount of NT$424,319 thousand was undistributed, and related expense was reversed in 2022.\n\n## 4.1.13  Impact to 2023 Business Performance and EPS of Stock Dividend Distribution: Not applicable.\n\n## 4.1.14 Buyback of Common Stock\n\nTSMC's Board of Directors approved the issuance of 1,387,000 shares for 2021 employee restricted stock awards (RSAs) at its meeting on February 15, 2022. In order to offset dilution from the increase of outstanding shares due to the above-mentioned issuance, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback program for TSMC to buy back its common shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The shares purchased will be cancelled subsequently. The implementation of the share buyback program was as follows.\n\n## (1) Completed Share Buyback Program\n\n|                                                                                                                            | As of 02/28/2023                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose of the share buyback                                                                                               | For the shareholders' interests                                                                                                  |\n| Scheduled buyback period                                                                                                   | 02/16/2022 - 04/15/2022                                                                                                          |\n| Scheduled buyback price range                                                                                              | NT$444 to NT$960 per share, while the buyback will still be carried out if the  stock price falls below the aforementioned range |\n| Type and number of shares bought back                                                                                      | Common shares: 1,387,000 shares                                                                                                  |\n| Total monetary amount of shares bought back                                                                                | NT$871,566,000                                                                                                                   |\n| Number of shares bought back as a percentage of the approved number of shares to be bought back (%)                        | 100%                                                                                                                             |\n| Number of shares cancelled and/or transferred                                                                              | 1,387,000 shares                                                                                                                 |\n| Cumulative number of the company's treasury shares held                                                                    | 0 share                                                                                                                          |\n| Cumulative number of the company's treasury shares as a percentage of the total number of the  company's issued shares (%) | 0.00%                                                                                                                            |\n\n- (2) Uncompleted Share Buyback Program: None.",

The average annual training time per employee increased to 69.5 hours, an increase of 42% over the previous year. TSMC training expense reached NT$968 million and the average training cost per employee is about NT$13,000, a 5.6-fold increase from the previous year (Note).\n\n## 5.6.6 Competitive Overall Compensation\n\nIn order to develop the most effective compensation strategies, TSMC reviews and selects benchmark companies annually and collects market information on compensation data of the whole industry for competitiveness analysis.\n\nTSMC's compensation program includes a monthly salary, performance bonuses based on quarterly business results, and profit sharing based on annual results.\n\nThe purpose of the business performance bonus and profit sharing programs is to reward employee contributions appropriately, to encourage employees to work consistently toward ensuring TSMC's success, and to align employee interests with those of TSMC's shareholders so as to achieve win-wins for the Company, shareholders and employees alike. The Company determines the bonus and profit sharing amounts based on operating results and domestic industry practice. The amount and distribution of the employee bonuses are recommended by the compensation committee to the Board of Directors for approval. Individual rewards are based on each employee's job responsibility, contributions and performance.\n\nA similar approach is used in TSMC's compensation programs at subsidiaries. In addition to providing employees with a locally competitive base salary, annual bonuses are granted as a part of total compensation, in line with local regulations, market practices and the overall operating performance of each subsidiary.\n\nIn addition to the competitive compensation described above, the Company has approved and implemented a global employee stock purchase plan in 2022 which is available to all regular employees of TSMC and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Through this plan, Employees are encouraged to participate in the Company's long-term success.\n\nTSMC believes that long-term ownership of Company shares by corporate officers helps align their interests with those of all shareholders, and therefore, the Company formulated Corporate Officer Shareholding Guidelines in 2020. The required holding value of TSMC shares by the chairman, CEO, and other corporate officers is proportional to their annual base salary: 18 times for the chairman and CEO, nine times for other officers in Taiwan facilities and VisEra, and three times for overseas officers. Officers shall fulfill the required value within three years of appointment and maintain the required value for the entire period of employment. Furthermore, to attract and retain corporate executives and other critical talent and to link their compensation with shareholder interests and environmental, social, governance (ESG) achievements, TSMC established employee restricted stock awards rules in 2021 and 2022.\n\n## 5.6.7 Employee Benefit System Superior to Statute\n\nTSMC offers employee benefits that are superior to the applicable statutes. In addition to twelve national holidays per year, seven memorial days are also designated as holidays. During the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce the risk of infection in public transportation and crowd gatherings, TSMC launched a split work and work from home policy. The Company provides employees with statuary labor insurance and national health insurance as well as comprehensive paid group insurance plans. Coverage includes life insurance and insurance for accidents, hospital coverage, cancer and critical illness and business travel. There are also various employee self-paid group insurance plans available at lower prices for employee family members. The group insurance coverage is extended to employees on approved unpaid leave. To better support new hires, TSMC offers one day of annual leave for every two months of service in the first year. Employees who need to take long leaves of absence for military service or severe injuries can also apply for unpaid leave, and then apply for reinstatement after the expiration of the period. In addition, TSMC provides pensions, financial assistance for emergencies, subsidies for marriage, childbirth and funerals, as well as discounts in designated shops.\n\nIn accordance with local laws and regulations, TSMC provides breastfeeding and breast milk collection rooms. To help employees balance their personal and work lives, TSMC not only offers parental leave but also provides a comprehensive leave management system. The Company established the TSMC childcare benefit program, to extend maternity leave from eight to 12 weeks and paternity leave from five to ten days. It also increased the maternity subsidy from NT$1,000 to NT$10,000 per child. TSMC has set up four on-site kindergartens for employees in Taiwan, so that employees can work in a peaceful mind. In addition, a holiday STEAM campus has been organized to accompany the growth of employee's children.\n\nAll TSMC facilities are equipped with 24-hour health centers, where healthcare management professionals and appointed onsite physicians provide quality services beyond those required legally. The health centers work with hospitals and employee assistance program service providers to offer comprehensive support for the emotional and physical well-being of employees. In addition to annual checkups for all employees, in 2022 TSMC began providing employees with five advanced checkup items upon completion of every five years of service.",

These risk appetite statements are:\n\n- \u25cf  Risk taken should be carefully evaluated, commensurate with rewards and be in line with the Company's strategic, investment, financial and corporate objectives.\n- \u25cf  Risk considerations are embedded into business operations and managed within the risk tolerance (risk indicators) of the divisions, functions and Company.\n- \u25cf  TSMC will not invest or participate in any business activities that exceeds our risk tolerance. The Company does not condone safety related breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as acts such as fraud, bribery and corruption.\n\nAdopting the five-step risk management process consisting of the identification, assessment, response, monitor and review of risks, risks assessments are performed by key functional units, to form the enterprise-level risk map and mitigation plans, that are presented to the Audit Committee. This process is supported by ongoing education and awareness efforts in fostering a risk-aware culture and building risk competencies.\n\n## \u25cf  Risk Management Scope\n\n| Strategic Risks                                                                                                                            | Operational Risks                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u25cf Industry developments                                                                                                                    | \u25cf Natural and man-made disasters                                                                             |\n| \u25cf Changes in technology (including IT security)                                                                                            | \u25cf Capacity expansion                                                                                         |\n| \u25cf Decrease in demand and average selling price                                                                                             | \u25cf Construction of new fabs                                                                                   |\n| \u25cf Competition                                                                                                                              | \u25cf Sales concentration                                                                                        |\n| \u25cf Changes in the government policies and regulatory environment                                                                            | \u25cf Purchasing concentration                                                                                   |\n|                                                                                                                                            | \u25cf Intellectual property rights                                                                               |\n| Financial Risks                                                                                                                            | \u25cf Litigious and non-litigious matters                                                                        |\n| \u25cf  Economic risks (including interest rate fluctuation, foreign exchange volatility, inflation, and amendments to tax                      | \u25cf Mergers and acquisitions \u25cf Recruiting quality personnel                                                    |\n| regulations or implementation of new tax laws) \u25cf                                                                                           | \u25cf Future R&D plans and expected R&D spending                                                                 |\n| External financing                                                                                                                         | \u25cf Change in corporate reputation and impact on the Company's crisis management                               |\n| \u25cf  High-risk/highly leveraged investments;

Variations in order levels from TSMC's customers may result in volatility in the Company's revenue and earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's services. If TSMC cannot take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company's revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\n\n## \u25cf  Changes in Technology\n\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company's competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, TSMC's customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).\n\nAlso, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If TSMC is unable to overcome\n\nthe above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.\n\nRegarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 18-20 of this Annual Report.\n\n## \u25cf  IT Security\n\nEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC's systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.\n\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC's network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail the Company to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.\n\nIn the past, TSMC has experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software. TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to protect fab equipment, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, introducing new solution architecture to secure internet access, adopting advanced solutions against distributed denial-of-service attacks from the internet,\n\nintroducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risks reduction, through collaboration, TSMC helped major suppliers improve their security maturity and share industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, TSMC has collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute ('SEMI') to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company's cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for it and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While TSMC requires such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers' computing systems, the Company's commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling Price\n\nA vast majority of the Company's revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC's products in smartphones, high performance computing, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's products and services, could adversely affect the Company's revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing",

        "page_content": "facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of its operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or TSMC's capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease TSMC's margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve TSMC's margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices ('ASP') of end use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC, which, in turn, may negatively impact the Company's revenue, margin and earnings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Competition\n\nThe markets for TSMC's foundry services are highly competitive. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea, and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the 'U.S. CHIPS Act'), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to apply for or receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC expects or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receive may be subject to strict conditions, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny our requested subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC's operating costs and adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities\n\nmay decrease TSMC's customer base or its ASP, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such new and aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers to such new contenders.\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory Environment\n\nTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC's business and financial operations. During 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the following changes or developments in governmental policies and regulations may influence the Company's business operations:\n\nThe manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. Climate change related laws or regulations currently are too indefinite for the Company to assess the impact on our future financial condition with any degree of reasonable certainty. For example, the Taiwan 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act', which became effective on July 1, 2015, was amended and was renamed as 'Climate Change Response Act'. The amendment became effective in February 2023, which set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and also established a carbon fee system that will collect carbon fees on direct and indirect emissions from emitters whose emissions reach certain thresholds. The carbon fee system is expected to take effect by 2024 and the rate for such fees has yet to be determined by the relevant authorities. We may be required to pay any incurred carbon fees if our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds pursuant to the carbon fee system, which could result in increased operating costs for us and affect us financially to a certain extent. We expect to see more of its relevant regulations promulgated by the regulators in the future. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is reviewing, at all times, various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate related changes. The impact of such laws and regulations, as well as of the carbon fee, is indeterminable at the moment.\n\nIt is not expected that other governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC's operations or financial condition.\n\n## 6.3.3 Operational Risks\n\n## Natural and Man-Made Disaster\n\nTSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience in accordance with business continuity management standards that equips it with the capability to respond effectively to business disruption. Disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, cyber-attacks, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc. could interrupt TSMC's operations.\n\nMost of TSMC's production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity or water, which could cause interruptions to TSMC's operations.\n\nThus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC's operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce TSMC's manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.\n\nTo cope with possible droughts resulted from severe climate change, TSMC implemented manufacturing process water saving, as well as building up industrial water recycling plants, using household water cooperating with government to mitigate water shortage risk. TSMC also implemented its business continuity plans, including water conservation measures, the use of more alternative water sources, water supplied by tank cars, stress tests and various exercises. As a result, there was no material impact to TSMC's business or operational performance.\n\nTSMC has occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to TSMC's operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs, its ability to fill customers' orders would be jeopardized.\n\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC's operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, TSMC's future capacity expansions in Taiwan and elsewhere could be curtailed by utility shortages.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had impacts on worldwide economic activity. Prolonged impacts of COVID-19 or future similar events could adversely affect TSMC's business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC's supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) fluctuation in TSMC customers' demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC's capacity planning and also for meeting customer demand, which may harm TSMC's business with its customers and subject TSMC to the risk of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC's products due to forced fab or office closures or partial operation.\n\nTSMC has formed an 'Epidemic Prevention Committee' to identify, implement and monitor actions stemming from the dynamic exigencies of the pandemic, including but not limited to, health management of its employees, splitting operation and work from home arrangements, identification and control of high risk individuals, rapid investigation of confirmed cases, management of production inventory, supply chain management, and capacity management for demand changes. As of the date of this annual report, TSMC's current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC does not expect its business and results of operations will be directly affected . Nevertheless, the Company could still face the post-pandemic downward changes in consumers' demand for electronic products, which in turn lead to reduced demand for and place downward pressure on the price of TSMC's products and services.\n\nTSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, and the establishment of taskforces before emergency events. The taskforces define emergency response, crisis communication, recovery plans and preventative measures based on the thorough analysis of derivative effects and alternative solutions to ensure the impacts of people injury, business interruption, finance are minimized. TSMC reviews periodically its business continuity plans and refines them to reflect exercise results and implementation. In response to",

        "page_content": "the impact of the earthquakes that occurs in Taiwan, TSMC continues to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have been integrated into new fab design. TSMC's business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301 business continuity management system (BCMS).\n\nTSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.\n\nTSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC's risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC's fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC's manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC's financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor key disruptive threats to its business operations and adapt the plans to ensure operational resilience.\n\n## Risks Associated with Capacity Expansion\n\nTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasts for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued\n\nto add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Nanjing, China and in Kumamoto, Japan.\n\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.\n\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC's market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.\n\n## Risks Associated with Construction of New Fabs\n\nThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. The Company expects to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u25cf  higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on the Company's ability to sustain its current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by its ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;\n- \u25cf  labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of the Company's expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet its capacity expansion plans;\n- \u25cf  disruptions to the Company's operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity;\n- \u25cf  scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit the Company's future expansion of operations;\n- \u25cf  compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if the Company's practices are deemed not to be in compliance;\n- \u25cf  challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks by third parties worldwide;\n- \u25cf  adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives;\n- \u25cf  challenges relating to work culture differences and inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances;\n- \u25cf  limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing the Company's rights to intellectual property; and\n- \u25cf  exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.\n\nIf TSMC is unable to overcome the above challenges, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Associated with Sales Concentration\n\nOver the years, the Company's customer profile and the nature of the Company's customers' business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC's ten largest customers in 2020, 2021 and 2022 accounted for approximately, 74%, 71% and 68% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's largest customer in 2020, 2021 and 2022 accounted for 25%, 26% and 23% of the Company's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's second largest customer in 2020 and 2021 accounted for 12% and 10% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year. In 2022, TSMC's second largest customer accounted for less than 10% of TSMC's net revenue.\n\nA more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC's revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company's large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company's business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry\n\nwith the structural shift to mobile and high performance computing (HPC) devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.\n\nThere are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in its customers' business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward the system companies developing their own designed semiconductors and working directly with semiconductor foundries which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.\n\nAlso, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC's customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC's major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company's customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at TSMC's major customers, could impact the Company's ability to supply products to those customers, reduce those customers' demand for TSMC's products and services and impact their business operations.\n\nThe loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company's top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers' business models, may adversely affect TSMC's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration\n\n## \u25cf  Raw Materials\n\nTSMC's production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw",

        "page_content": "materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company's needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC's revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources. Further, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas.\n\nGiven that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, ESH (environmental, safety and health) and BCP (business continuity plan). Onsite audits are conducted regularly to encourage suppliers to take responsibility for their supply chain, as any regulatory violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure to meet sustainability requirements could result in business reduction or termination.\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment\n\nThe Company's operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain an appropriate amount of equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. TSMC may encounter the situation of limited\n\nsupply and long delivery cycles. To better manage its supply chain, the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. However, if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs, it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers' demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights\n\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\n\nThe Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC's technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those\n\nsemiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC's cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.\n\nIf the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.\n\nThe Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious Matters\n\nAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their\n\npatents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC's business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.\n\nCurrently, TSMC's material legal proceeding is as follows: In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC ('Daedalus') filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. The outcome cannot be determined and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.\n\nOther than the matter described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality Personnel\n\nTSMC relies on the continued service and contribution of its management team, skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company's business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment challenges, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the actual workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment",

At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talented individuals at an early phase in order to recruit them in the future.\n\n## Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D Spending\n\nFor additional details, see '5.2.7 Future R&D Plans' on page 102 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on the Company's Crisis Management\n\nTSMC has established an excellent reputation based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company's positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to sustainable responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in economic, environmental and social dimensions.\n\nIn 2022, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in various areas including operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability, and other fields. The Company was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 22 nd consecutive year and received the following awards: the inaugural Honorable Legion of Corporate Sustainability Top 100 launched by CommonWealth Magazine the Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award; the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2022 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards' First Place in Taiwan Top Ten Sustainability Exemplary Awards - the Corporate Sustainability Report Award - the Climate Leadership Award, the Circular Economy Leadership Award, the Supply Chain Management Award, the Sustainable Water Management Award, the Growth Through Innovation Leadership Award, and the Information Security Leadership Award. TSMC ranked in the top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation. The Company was named a member of: Fortune Magazine's 2022 World's Most Admired Companies and the Fortune Global 500; the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2022; and of the 2022 Carbon Clean 200 TM list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow. In addition, TSMC was selected as part of the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI) ESG Leaders Index.\n\nTo promote sustainability, TSMC's ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, presented the third TSMC ESG Award in 2022, honoring internal organizations and divisions for tangible achievements in the Company's five ESG strategic directions: Drive Green Manufacturing, Build a Responsible Supply Chain, Create a Diverse and Inclusive Workplace, Develop Talent, and Care For The Disadvantaged. At the same time, this award presentation encouraged all employees to propose new ideas for sustainability to be assessed for feasibility and potential incorporation in the Company's implementation plans. Compared with 1,257 sustainability proposals in the second year, the third annual ESG Award received 1,880 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company's culture of sustainability.\n\nMindful of its global reputation, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC practices  crisis management and implements recovery measures to deal with possible crisis events and maintains a crisis command center for control guideline and prepares emergency response procedures' to ensure timely and prompt responses during a crisis. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis management procedures are comprehensive. and validated. In 2022, TSMC received a rating of 'Low ESG Risk' from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings.\n\nTSMC's environment, safety and health committee holds monthly meetings to coordinate with relevant departments in each fab to conduct emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders if a crisis arises, with the public relations division serving as the designated gateway for external communications.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize the impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, and company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations division at the earliest stages to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Change in Management\n\nIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.\n\n## Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting Business\n\nBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. The Company's failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, or its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:\n\n- \u25cf  significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;\n- \u25cf  unfavorable alterations in TSMC's manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;\n- \u25cf  challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;\n- \u25cf  restrictions on TSMC's operations or sales;\n- \u25cf  loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and\n- \u25cf  damages to TSMC's goodwill and reputation.\n\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if the Company's emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits,\n\nsubstitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company's operations.\n\nTSMC's inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC's operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nTSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC's climate change related risks and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy Management section under '7.2.1 Environmental Protection' on page 156-157 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 6.3.4 Financial Risks\n\n## Economic Risks\n\nAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation and changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically, and if the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating income and net income. For example, starting in March 2023, the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption as a result of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank as well as UBS' announced acquisition of Credit Suisse. Concerns about the soundness of the banking system may cause small- and medium-sized banks to tighten their lending to preserve liquidity, which in turn could weigh on economic growth. If such levels of market volatility and disruption continue or escalate into systematic financial crisis or global economic downturn, it could result in a number of adverse follow-on effects on TSMC, including decreased customer demand, delays in the payment of account receivables to us, and insolvency of suppliers or customers.",

        "page_content": "## \u25cf  Interest Rate Fluctuation\n\nTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe objective of TSMC's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC's cash and cash equivalents, as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities, carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.\n\nTSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nThe majority of TSMC's long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\nCertain of TSMC's fixed income investments are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be replaced by alternative benchmark rates after June 30, 2023. The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates might result in a reduction in TSMC's interest income.\n\n## \u25cf  Foreign Exchange Volatility\n\nSubstantially all of TSMC's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company's revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S.\n\ndollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company's operating margin based on its 2022 results.\n\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC's customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company's revenue.\n\nTSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollardenominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.\n\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's common shares and the market price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC's common shares represented by ADSs.\n\n## \u25cf  Inflation\n\nTSMC is subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce our products, wage expenses and employee benefits, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although TSMC does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of its products and services do not increase with these increased costs.\n\n## Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax Laws\n\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.\n\nWhile the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC's principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company ('CFC') rules enacted in 2016\n\nhave been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that develop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified R&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes over a fiscal year. The Company anticipates that it will be eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation. Additionally, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC's operating results. In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.\n\n## Risks Associated with External Financing\n\nIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.\n\n## Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative Transactions\n\nIn 2022 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and TSMC's subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or TSMC's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.\n\nTo manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with\n\nthe relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC's policies and procedures include 'Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,' 'Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,' 'Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,' and 'Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.'\n\n## Risks Associated with Impairment Charges\n\nUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income.\n\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company's operating results are otherwise already depressed. See 'Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY' in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\n\n## 6.3.5 Other Risks\n\n## Potential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC's Directors, and/ or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC's Total Outstanding Shares\n\nThe value of TSMC shareholders' investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC's total outstanding shares.\n\n## Risks of Trade Policies\n\nAs TSMC's revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 18-20 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC's operating results.",

        "page_content": "In May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, 'Huawei'), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. Since February 2022, there have been expansive measures, including sanctions and export controls, imposed by several countries and regions against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, in connection with the military conflict in Ukraine. In October 2022, the U.S. adopted additional export controls over China on advanced computing integrated circuits ('ICs'), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The new controls add new license requirements for items destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as U.S. persons' activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing like TSMC, will be decided on a case-by-case basis. In the same month, we secured a one-year general authorization from the U.S. government, which allows us to maintain the Company's fab's operations in Nanjing, China. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue securing such general authorization on a timely basis or at all. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country's actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational's compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.\n\nImposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls, could increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies, make our pricing less competitive, and impact the sales of TSMC or its customers. In 2022 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\n## Other Material Risks\n\nIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC's management was not aware of any other risk that could potentially have a material impact on the financial status of the Company.",

The ESG Department, on behalf of the ESG Committee, works together with cross-organizational representatives to identify key sustainability issues in relation to the Company's operations and stakeholders' concern. Task forces are formed based on various issues to frame adaptive strategies, goals and action plans. The committee holds quarterly meetings to track progress and ensure the strategies are implemented effectively in daily operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors supervises and guides the Company's sustainability management, strategies, and goals. The ESG Committee Chairperson reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on the implementation of plans and results. In 2022, TSMC focused primarily on green manufacturing and supply chain management (including net zero emission, renewable energy access and use, and low-carbon value chain management), workplace diversity & inclusion and talent development (including employee resource groups, diversity and inclusion practices for R&D talents, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs for high school girls), sustainability disclosures in sustainability report, theme reports such as TCFD Repot, UN SDGs Action Report and Materiality Analysis Report, sustainable culture advocacy (i.e., TSMC ESG awards), empowerment projects in remote areas and 2021 ESG spending updates, etc.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nTSMC respects all stakeholders' rights and interests in sustainability issues.

and Health (ESH) Management\n\nTSMC believes its environmental, safety and health practices must not only meet legal requirements but should also align with internationally recognized best practices. The Company's ESH policies aim to achieve 'zero incidents' and 'environmental sustainability' and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company's strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.\n\nAll TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. TSMC and its subsidiaries' fabs in Taiwan have each been certified by the Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS). All the above certifications are maintained valid. Per TSMC policy, all new facilities are required to attain the aforementioned certifications within\n\n18 months of receiving their facility license. In 2022, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan completed the renewal of ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and TOSHMS certificates with three year validity. At the same time, three new fabs, Fab 12 Phase 8, Fab 18B and Advanced Backend Fab 6, also passed third-party verification and obtained certificates.\n\nTo reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks, TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage.\n\nIn order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 hazardous substance process management (HSPM) system. All TSMC Fabs have been QC 080000 certified and maintained validity since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with international regulatory and customer requirements, including the European Union's 'Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive,' the EU's 'Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),' the 'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,' the 'halogen-free in electronic products' initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In addition, in 2016 TSMC started a project to minimize usage of the hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and as a result by the end of 2022 NMP use in the Company's Taiwan fabs had been reduced by 97.2% compared to 2016, and achieved 2022's 95% reduction goal. TSMC will continue to further reduce NMP usage in its subsidiary fabs.\n\nIn 2011, TSMC began implementing the ISO 50001 energy management system for continuous improvement in energy conservation. As of 2022, all TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification except for one. The Company's WaferTech subsidiary in the U.S. was originally scheduled to receive this certification in 2021 but it has been postponed to 2023 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level to meet on an\n\nad-hoc basis depending on occupational disease cases or other issues. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.\n\nTo minimize the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.\n\nTSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure the Company's safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.\n\nTSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and re-coaching for suppliers with poor performance. Strengthening the professional capabilities of suppliers in environmental protection, safety and health, fire response, and carbon inventory were key focuses in 2022, as the Company held the environmental protection, safety and health workshops (56 participants from 50 suppliers), fire emergency response workshops (58 participants from 50 suppliers), and product carbon footprint inventory workshop (24 participants from 20 suppliers). In addition, for the past seven years suppliers have been invited to observe TSMC's annual emergency response drills (166 participants from 161 suppliers)",

                     |\n\n## Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction and Energy Management\n\nIn response to threats presented by extreme weather, TSMC sets strategies and targets, ensures sound execution and strives to build a sustainable culture. In 2021, TSMC announced its long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2030. TSMC remains committed to becoming a global leader in green manufacturing.\n\nTSMC actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and has leveraged its past experience to develop best practices to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFC) emissions, measures that have been fully adopted and implemented since 2012. In 2013, in accordance with the 'EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction' regulation, TSMC applied for recognition of GHG reduction from 2005 to 2011 and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset GHG emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company's sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.\n\nSince 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company's strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated in the international disclosure and rating agency - CDP to publicly disclose climate change information for 18 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve related management practices.\n\nIn response to the commitment of global climate summit 'Paris Agreement' and the Republic of China's 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act' promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, the Company also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by the fab operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC's GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency in operating its facilities. These efforts simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 3.1 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016. In February 2023, Taiwan renamed the 'Greenhouse",

TSMC will continue to pay attention to and evaluate the company's impact, so as to respond early.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs' green power purchasing program and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with other suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy, TSMC has committed to achieving 40% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2022 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emissions for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company has made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations include expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing the supply of the renewable energy trading platform. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2022, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 2.9 GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company's active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2020 TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (the global corporate renewable energy initiative) and pledged that power consumption of all the Company's manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050.\n\n## TSMC GHG Emissions in

each wafer fab to meet regulatory emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment 24 hours a day by rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.\n\nTSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide. To make the most effective use of Taiwan's limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation. The long-term target is a 30% decrease by 2030. By 2022, TSMC's unit product water consumption had decreased by 2.6% from 2010 levels. Challenges in 2022 included new wafer fab (Fab 18B), which was in the process of setting up, so water conservation rate decreased as the production line was still in the testing stage and production had not yet reached economic scale. Excluding the aforementioned new wafer fab, the Company's water consumption per unit of product decreased by 15.6% compared with the base year, and the annual target was achieved. All TSMC fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. The Company also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing-related water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and in kitchens.\n\nSince water resources are restricted by geographical conditions, TSMC shares its water saving experience and expertise with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve Science Park's goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to further recycling water resources and supporting the government policy and promotion of reclaimed water. TSMC's Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant began operation on September 19, 2022, the first private reclaimed water plant in Taiwan. Introducing reclaimed water into the manufacturing process is pioneering work in the semiconductor industry. TSMC promises to continue to increase the utilization of reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future.\n\nTo further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard, the world's only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2022, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, Fab 5, located in Hsinchu Science Park, and Advanced Backend Fab 3 in Longtan Science Park passed a third-party verification audit and also obtained AWS platinum level certification. TSMC's advanced product fabs in Taiwan's three major Science Parks have all achieved AWS platinum certification.

        "page_content": "## Waste Management and Recycling\n\nIn recent years, as TSMC continued to develop advanced processes and expand capacity rapidly both at home in Taiwan and overseas, waste production has increased due to the complexity of new process development, demand for reliable yield rates, and increasing use of raw materials.\n\nTo achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are process waste reduction, onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with incineration and landfill as least desirable final options. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced by processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2021, TSMC recycled waste copper sulfate, cobalt-containing liquid, waste sulfuric acid and waste ammonium sulfate, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed the system of cryolite synthesis whereby waste hydrogen fluoride (HF) is recycled and regenerated into raw material used in other industries. As a result, the Company has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. In 2022, TSMC became the first company in the semiconductor industry to use anaerobic digestion technology to reuse organic sludge in order to generate green electricity and implement green manufacturing. At the same time, TSMC's fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the eighth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the thirteenth consecutive year. Furthermore, Fab 12 earned the platinum UL 2799 certification, the highest grade for zero landfill in 2021. All TSMC facilities in Taiwan plan to obtain UL 2799 certification in 2023.\n\n## TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two Years (Note 1)\n\n|   Year | Outsourced  General Waste  (ton) (Note 2)   | Outsourced  Hazardous Waste  (ton) (Note 2)   |   Outsourced Unit  Waste Disposal  (Note 3) (kg/12-inch  equivalent wafer  mask layer) |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2022 | 342,804                                     | 401,215                                       |                                                                                   0.99 |\n|   2021 | 335,080                                     | 339,623                                       |                                                                                   0.99 |\n\n## TSMC Waste Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                  | 2030 Goal                                                                                    | 2022 Target and  Achievement                                                                                  | Achievement  Status   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Promote waste  reduction by source  separation and  require vendors to  provide low chemical  consumption | Outsourced unit waste  disposal per wafer  \u2266 0.50 (kg/12-inch  equivalent wafer mask  layer) | Outsourced unit waste  disposal per wafer 0.99  (kg/12-inch equivalent  wafer mask layer)  (Target:  \u2266 0.99%) | Exceeded              |\n\nIn order to ensure that all waste is treated and recycled properly, TSMC closely tracks the recycling and reuse practices of its cleanup and disposal vendors. The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that have certificates and permits, regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., compares with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. At the same time, to further guarantee proper waste handling, TSMC built the system of waste intelligent fast track (S.W.I.F.T) and completed five different types of waste treatment vendors for pilot testing in 2022. TSMC intends to roll out SWIFT to all waste treatment vendors in 2025. By using Artificial Intelligent technology replacing in-person on-site spot checks, the Company increases inspections efficiency by 65 times and reduces manual inspection by 13,000 hours each year. In addition, TSMC also conducts ongoing surveys of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nThe purpose of TSMC's environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC's environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company's economic\n\nbenefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major environmental projects. In 2022, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$3,720 million.\n\n## 2022 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in Taiwan\n\nUnit: NT$ thousands\n\n| Classification                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Expense                                           | Investment                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

Moreover, by monitoring the working environment and conditions, advanced sensors can make equipment smarter so that it can operate in a more energy efficient way.\n\n## 7.2.3 Safety and Health\n\n## Safety and Health Management\n\nTSMC's safety and health management is compliant with local and international standards and adheres to the management approach of 'Plan, Do, Check, Act' to prevent accidents, promote employee safety and health, and protect Company assets. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demands of stakeholders, the assessment of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to identify safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All Company fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications have been maintained. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC's internal policy.\n\nBesides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.\n\nFor epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n## Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health Protection\n\nThe Company's ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee's awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building a strong ESH culture.\n\nThere were a total of 35 occupational injuries at TSMC in 2022, involving 35 people, representing approximately 0.04% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.27, under the 0.4 target, and the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 3, meeting the target of less than 4. In response, TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as interlocking devices for machine safety, as well as standard safety operation procedures. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health during their work.\n\nTSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment Safety and Health Management\n\nIn addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.\n\nTSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate the transportation of 300mm front-opening unified pods (FOUPs) to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of this equipment. TSMC 300mm fabs have all converted to automatic transportation control.\n\n## \u25cf  Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances\n\nAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by\n\nthe new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry's safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that environmental, safety and health concerns about new chemicals are addressed and controlled including the use of engineering controls and personal protection equipment, as well as operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal. A total of 434 cases of new tools and chemical substances were passed by the new tool and new chemical review committee in 2022, and they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards before entering TSMC.\n\n## \u25cf  General Safety Management, Training and Audit\n\nAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize injuries to employees and damage to property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.\n\nTSMC Safety-related Training and Promotion in the Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Total Number of Employees who have Completed  Safety-related Training   |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2022 | 271,702                                                                 |\n|   2021 | 289,398                                                                 |\n\n## \u25cf  Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management\n\nTSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates employees and requires them, when appropriate, to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.\n\nThe Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO 2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances as regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health",

        "page_content": "effect on employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the risk of hazardous factors exposure to acceptable levels.\n\n## \u25cf  Health Promotion Program\n\nIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:\n\n- 1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.\n- 2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.\n- 3.  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: request suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier's safety data sheet (SDS).\n\n## \u25cf  Emergency Response\n\nThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response requires identifying potential high-risk events via risk assessment and being prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvements and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC's emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.\n\nAll TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC's onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. In 2022, the Company held 109 evacuation drills and 53 fire drills. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response\n\nto emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the all-hazard approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2022, 428 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 235 full-scale exercises.\n\nIn addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company's laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.\n\n## \u25cf  Emerging Infectious Disease Response\n\nTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC's (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company's strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. In order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, TSMC reviews the situation from time to time and formulates appropriate preventive measures such as daily body temperature checks and updated vaccination information before entering Company facilities and\n\ncontinues to follow epidemic prevention recommendations such as mask wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing.\n\n## \u25cf  Employee Physical and Mental Health Enhancement\n\nTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation's responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2022, through planned personal health management, (1) 543 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. All but one of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One woman was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC has sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 4,485 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 201 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and insomnia, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2022, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation's preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (6,458 participants; total weight loss reached\n\n5,322.9kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: three sessions of 'Health Lecture Online' with 2,876 attendees in total; three health education promotion materials about Weight-loss Diets , with a total of 25,776 person-times; four sessions of online quizzes on the topics of insomnia and improving sleeping,  with a total of 16,656 attendees; and one-on-one sleep counseling 93 attendees in total. The above activities have all received positive feedback from employees. In the future, we will continue to implement relevant health promotion activities to take care of the health of employees.\n\n## 7.2.4 Supplier Management\n\n## Management Aspect\n\nFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities have obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.\n\n## Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nSince becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.",

In recent times, however, Peking opera has all but vanished from the horizon of today's youth. In order to rekindle interest in the heritage of this beautiful theatrical culture, the Foundation began the 'Passing on Traditional Theatre Heritage on Campus' project with GuoGuang Opera Company, funding a two-semester course at National Tsing Hua University and Tunghai University. The content of the course includes knowledge of theater, appreciation and analysis of plays, and workshop and stage performances. The lectures guided 93 college students to personally experience the performance of Peking opera step by step and in depth and to appreciate the charm of Peking opera aesthetics. In addition to university courses, the Foundation also organized four 'TSMC Theater Lectures' specifically for senior high school students in the Hsinchu area and focused on the theme of major maid characters in Peking opera. There were professional introduction lectures by Wang An Chi, emeritus professor at the Department of Drama and Theatre of NTU, by the Taipei Culture Awards winner Zhu An Li and by the young actors at GuoGuang Opera Company, who demonstrated the use of makeup art, the art of recitation and hand gestures as basic techniques of Peking opera. The lecture series broadened the younger generation's artistic horizon and helped them appreciate the scenes on stage and behind the stage. Furthermore, the Foundation commissioned a radio program, 'Telling Stories of Peking Opera' at IC: the Sound of Hsinchu Science Park, to stimulate public interest in the art of Peking opera by presenting various topics about theater and interesting stories of the plays.\n\nThe theme of the annual TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival in 2022 was 'Feast of the Gods,' as the Contemporary Legend Theater performed 'Metamorphosis,' a play adapted from Franz Kafka's novella by the Peking opera maestro Wu Hsing-kuo, and a brand new production of a traditional play 'Eight Gods Crossing the Sea.' In addition to live performances, the Arts Festival also combined various formats of arts events in different media such as streaming platforms and television, including 'Like a Rolling Poem - a Documentary on Music and Poetry' and 'Film & Mythology,' an online film festival. The 2022 TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival organized 42 exquisite art exhibitions and cultural events, inviting more than 15,000 community members to attend. Along with the TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival, the Foundation continued to support\n\nmajor performing arts groups in Taiwan by sponsoring the production of Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute) at the National Taichung Theater and conducting and composing masterclasses at the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) in hopes of bringing a fresh perspective to Taiwan's arts environment during the pandemic and keeping the arts' flame burning bright.\n\n## 7.4 TSMC Charity Foundation\n\nUnder the guidance of Chairperson Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation (the Foundation) strives to address social inequalities through volunteer onsite/online services. Established in 2017, the Foundation focuses on the four pillars of public welfare in its charitable programs and projects: care for the disadvantaged, taking care of the elderly, filial piety promotion, and protection of the environment. In 2022, the Foundation's focus on assisting the disadvantaged honed in on rural empowerment as part of an initiative to correlate with social trends in rural education and employment integration. In rural areas, the Foundation offers various educational development resources to schools and after-schools. As for eldercare and care for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, the Foundation endeavors to improve their quality of life through both economic support and medical services. The Foundation continued to operate the 'Sending Love' platform to strengthen the cooperation among enterprises, local governments and universities so as to strengthen local services and jointly uplift society.\n\nIn 2022, the Foundation demonstrated its dedication to investing in public welfare and expanding projects to improve its scope of services:\n\n- \u25cf  Rural Empowerment: The Foundation continuously provides education and living assistance to institutes in need and to children in rural areas, including volunteer services, economic support, food supplies and the purchase of digital learning equipment and materials. In 2022, the Foundation focused on rural students' employability. By collaborating with 104 JOB BANK on the 'World of Jobs, Road to Employment' plan, the Foundation published 104 career exploring videos in 2022 to give rural students a broader outlook on future careers and encourage them to develop their potential. In helping rural students to obtain the skills to work locally, two enterprises, Chi Mei Frozen Food Co., Ltd. and Lohas Biotech Development Corp., joined this year to give training to two vocational high schools and extended job offers to 14 students. While the expanded plan of job placement was\n\nreleased in 2022, the Foundation partnered with SEMI to hold a conference session in 2022 SEMICON Taiwan and to establish a job-matching platform with 30 TSMC suppliers and semiconductor-related enterprises providing 600 jobs for rural vocational students.\n\nIn 2022, the Foundation assisted 6,358 students at 134 rural care institutes and collaborated with TSMC volunteers to produce tutorial videos of scientific experiments and science education. When classes were suspended due to the pandemic, the Foundation supplied science learning materials to help students study at home and moved physical classes online to ensure students could continue their studies. The Foundation's 'Sending Love Platform' initiative visited and screened disadvantaged individuals in need of financial support, and also provided financial assistance and daily necessities made possible by internal and external donations from TSMC to improve the living conditions of highly vulnerable and disadvantaged families. As of 2022, the Foundation has supported a total of 250 families.\n\n- \u25cf  Taking Care of the Elderly: The Foundation collaborates with Network of Compassion partners to enhance the health and welfare of solitary elders by connecting them with social welfare groups and medical units. In 2022, the Foundation cooperated with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Guandau Hospital to establish a smart exercise club for the elderly to prevent disability and delay aging through exercise. The Foundation continued to collaborate with the TSMC facility division to repair 285 houses damaged by the earthquake in Hualien, and further ensuring 16 solitary elders a safe and healthy living space after the disaster. Current Network of Compassion partners include Taipei Municipal Gandau Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Miao-Li Hospital, Old Five Old Foundation, Fongyuan Hospital, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City Private Lin Tseng Lien Welfare And Charity Foundation, Taiwan Puli Care Association, Sin-Lau Hospital, Tainan Municipal Hospital, Jianan Psychiatric Center Department of Health, Mennonite Christian Hospital, Mennonite Social Welfare Foundation, Fooyin University, Penghu Hospital, and Cishan Hospital.\n- \u25cf Promoting Filial Piety: The Foundation promotes the spirit of filial piety in Eastern culture by spreading awareness to younger generations so as to alleviate social risks and issues related to aging societies. In 2022, the Foundation continued to work with the Filial Piety Resource Center of the K-12\n\nEducation Administration, Ministry of Education to promote these concepts and cultural values. This included conducting ten filial piety parent-child workshops at elementary schools, where TSMC volunteers provide long-term care, as well as jointly producing short filial piety films and organizing award ceremonies to recognize excellence in teaching plans, thus encouraging both teachers and students to initiate intergenerational dialogue and to implant a modern spirit of filial piety within the hearts of all participants.\n\n- \u25cf  Protecting the Environment: The Foundation helped disadvantaged social welfare institutes to increase the use of green energy and save power, while also continuing to implement the 'Cherish Food Program' to reduce resource waste. The 'Green Energy for the Disadvantaged' project was launched in 2021, and by 2022 the Foundation had installed solar panels at six social welfare institutes, which can supplement these institutes' operating expenses by selling green energy. The LED Lighting Replacement Program helped 240 schools to reduce electricity costs by at least 30% with energy-saving lights. As for the 'Cherish Food Program', the Foundation continued to work with many food companies to donate out-of-spec foods to 130 disadvantaged social welfare institutes to provide the children with after-school snacks, thereby reducing food waste. Current collaborators include Chi Mei Frozen Food Co., Ltd., Hunya Food Co., Ltd., Laurel Corporation, Lian-Hwa Foods Corp., Hsin Tung Yang Co., Ltd., Great Wall Group, and Lao Xie Zhen Co., Ltd.\n\n## 7.5 TSMC i-Charity\n\nThe TSMC i-Charity platform, launched in 2014, is an interactive intranet site that employees use to propose charity projects, share project results, provide suggestions and responses, and conduct timely funding of activities to give back to society.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 38,857 people donated more than NT$51.3 million to help repair earthquake-damaged houses in Hualien, to support the aboriginal elementary school's baseball team, Junyi Academy, and to aid the Teach for Taiwan program and other fundraising projects.\n\nThe TSMC i-Charity platform has accumulated more than NT$271 million in donations since its inception in 2014. TSMC continues to carry out its social commitments and encourages its employees to care for and give back to society in various ways.",

        "page_content": "Key audit matter for the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 is stated as follows:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) - commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation and construction in progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nRefer to Notes 4, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We read the Company's policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a. Evaluated  whether  the  selection  did  not  meet  the  criteria  specified  by  the  Company  for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nWe have also audited the parent company only financial statements of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS, IAS, IFRIC, and SIC endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as management\n\n-  3  -",

        "page_content": "determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance (including members of the Audit Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

GENERAL\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), a Republic of China (R.O.C.) corporation, was incorporated on February 21, 1987. TSMC is a dedicated foundry in the semiconductor industry which engages mainly in the manufacturing, sales, packaging, testing and computer-aided design of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices and the manufacturing of masks.\n\nOn September 5, 1994, TSMC's shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). On October 8, 1997, TSMC listed some of its shares of stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs).\n\nThe address of its registered office and principal place of business is No. 8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan. The principal operating activities of TSMC's subsidiaries are described in Note 4.\n\n## 2.

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.\n\n## 4.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFor the convenience of readers, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language consolidated financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC with the effective dates (collectively, 'Taiwan -IFRSs').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\n## The basis for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interests in subs idiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Company's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the\n\n- 15 -",

The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exc hange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n- 17 -",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\n- 18 -",

Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding  adjustment  to  their  carrying  amount  through  a  loss  allowance  account,  except  for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\n## c. Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cos t in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the ass et's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financia l liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## a. Fair value hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company's f ixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n- 20 -",

Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, to partially hedge its foreign  exchange  rate  risks  or  interest  rate  risks  associated  with  certain  highly  probable  forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items, or reclassified to finance costs of hedged items in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the id entifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive\n\n- 21 -",

Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- 22 -",

If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rates.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash -generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.

When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which\n\n- 24 -",

When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n\n## Share-based payment arrangements\n\n- a. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nRestricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and t he Company's best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.\n\nWhen restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.\n\n## b. Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements\n\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n- 25 -",

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nGovernment grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nGovernment grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from  the  commencement  date  until  the  exercise  date  of  the  option.  Main  factors  considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n## Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\n\n## Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\n\nSales  returns  and  other  allowance  is  estimated  and  recorded  based  on  historical  experience  and  in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue  and  expenses  related  to  the  specific  asset  groups  with  the  consideration  of  the  nature  of\n\n- 27 -",

Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations  could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market riskfree rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly salary to employees' pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada, TSMC Technology and JASM also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$4,550,387 thousand and NT$3,711,010 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nTSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                               | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                               | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Current service cost                                                          | $  134,376                | $  145,289                |\n| Net interest expense                                                          | 74,265                    | 47,196                    |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss              | 208,641                   | 192,485                   |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                           |                           |                           |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense)   | (429,948)                 | (73,298)                  |\n| Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments                            | 1,413,760                 | 94,278                    |\n| Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic  assumptions               | -                         | 277,454                   |\n| Actuarial gain arising from changes in financial assumptions                  | (160,752)                 | (540,513)                 |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other  comprehensive income | 823,060                   | (242,079)                 |\n| Total                                                                         | $  1,031,701              | $  (49,594)               |\n\n- 43 -",

Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC's Board of Directors and reported to TSMC's shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC's Articles of Incorporation.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve equivalent to the  net debit balance  of the other components of stockholders' equity, such as the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders' equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.\n\nThe appropri ations of 2022, 2021 and 2020 quarterly earnings have been approved by TSMC's Board of Directors in its meeting, respectively. The appropriations and cash dividends per share were as follows:\n\n| Resolution Date of TSMC's      Board of Directors in its      meeting   | Fourth Quarter    Third Quarter    Second Quarter    of 2022  February 14,      2023   | of 2022  November 8,  2022                                                | of 2022  August 9,  2022   | First Quarter of 2022 May 10, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Special capital reserve                                                 | $                                                                                      | 17,166,163      $  (31,910,353)      $  (12,002,798)      $  (15,541,054) |                            |                                      |\n| Cash dividends to shareholders                                          | $  71,308,546      $                                                                   | 71,308,547      $                                                         | 71,308,546      $          | 71,308,546                           |\n| Cash dividends per share (NT$)                                          | $  2.75                                                                                | $  2.75                                                                   | $  2.75                    | $  2.75                              |\n\n- 47 -\n\n- 47 -",

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit Committees (rename to Audit and Risk Committee from February 14, 2023)  and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantial ly all the Company's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange  rate  risks  associated  with  non-NT  dollar-denominated  assets  and  liabilities  and  certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$1,704,553 thousand and NT$1,435,346 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments in both fixed -  and floatingrate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of the Company's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, and may have\n\n- 62 -",

At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company's other comprehensive income by NT$3,831,326 thousand and NT$3,767,071 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAll of the Company's short -term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than expected. The majority of the Company's long -term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$631,530 thousand and NT$595,766 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 202 2 and 2021, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 82% and 79% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\nThe objective of the Company's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities since initial\n\n- 63 -",

The changes were mainly due to increased investment amount and adjusted investment portfolio.\n\n## e. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.\n\n|                                                                                                               | Less Than    1 Year   | 1-3 Years   | 3-5 Years   | More Than    5 Years   | Total         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| December 31, 2022                                                                                             |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                                                          |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Accounts payable (including related  parties)                                                                 | $  56,522,345         | $  -        | $  -        | $  -                   | $  56,522,345 |\n| Payables to contractors and  equipment suppliers                                                              | 213,499,613           | -           | -           | -                      | 213,499,613   |\n| Accrued expenses and other current  liabilities                                                               | 219,587,908           | -           | -           | -                      | 219,587,908   |\n| Bonds payable                                                                                                 | 34,668,909            | 94,869,159  | 320,211,460 | 625,049,539            | 1,074,799,067 |\n| Long-term bank loans                                                                                          | 1,278,130             | 3,533,152   | 1,360,549   | -                      | 6,171,831     |\n| Lease liabilities (including those  classified under accrued expenses  and other current liabilities)  (Note) | 2,999,840             | 5,367,809   | 4,754,007   | 22,589,117             | 35,710,773    |\n| Others                                                                                                        | -                     | 166,266,718 | 10,518,481  | 783,182                | 177,568,381   |\n|                                                                                                               | 528,556,745           | 270,036,838 | 336,844,497 | 648,421,838            | 1,783,859,918 |\n|                                                                                                               |                       |             |             |                        | (Continued)   |\n\n- 64 -",

On December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$48,704 thousand and NT51,372 thousand, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\n\nFor the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.\n\nIn addition, the fair values of convertible bonds are prior transaction prices.\n\n- 3)  Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value\n\nExcept as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below sets out the fair value hierarchy for the Company's financial assets and liabilities which are not required to be measured at fair value:\n\n|                                                         | December 31, 2022                  | December 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                         | Carrying  Amount                   | Level 2  Fair Value |\n| Financial assets                                        |                                    |                     |\n| Financial assets at amortized costs                     |                                    |                     |\n| Corporate bonds                                         | $  80,994,958      $               | 80,236,142          |\n| Commercial paper                                        | 48,732,476                         | 48,882,028          |\n|                                                         | $  129,727,434                     | $  129,118,170      |\n| Financial liabilities                                   |                                    |                     |\n| Financial liabilities at amortized costs  Bonds payable | $  852,436,439      $  765,301,535 |                     |\n\n- 68 -",

        "page_content": "Singapore. TSMC's equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased  all  the  SSMC  shares  owned  by  EDB  Investments  Pte  Ltd.  pro  rata  according  to  the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC's capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.\n\n- c. In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC ('Daedalus') filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') and the U.S. Dist rict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC  North  America,  and  other  companies  infringe  four  U.S.  patents.  The  ITC  instituted  an investigation in October 2022. The outcome cannot be determined and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.\n- d. TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste disposal with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- e. TSMC entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment.

Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We read the Company's policy and understood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a. Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the parent company only  financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of parent company only financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  parent  company  only  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance (including members of the Audit Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company only financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these parent company only financial statements.\n\n-  2  -",

        "page_content": "As part of an audit in accordance with  the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China,  we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the parent company only financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the parent company only financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the parent company only financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n-  3  -",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFor the convenience of readers, the accompanying parent company only  financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language parent company only financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers (the 'Accounting Standar ds Used in Preparation of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nWhen preparing the parent company only financial statements, the Company account for subsidiaries and associates by using the equity method. In order to agree with the amount of net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the parent in the consolidated financial statements, the differences of the accounting treatment between the parent company only basis and the consolidated basis are adjusted under the heading of investments accounted for using equity method, share of profits of subsidiaries and associates and share of other comprehensive income of subsidiaries and associates in the parent company only financial statements.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nIn preparing the parent company only financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\n- 124 -",

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets  expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n- 125 -",

Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\nInvestments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.\n\nDividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the C ompany's right to receive the dividends is established , unless the Company's rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.\n\n## 4)  Measured at amortized cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents,  commercial paper, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables, refundable deposits and temporary payments (classified under other current assets and other noncurrent assets) are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost  are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.\n\n## b. Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n- 126 -",

Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Co mpany's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 127 -",

The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its  foreign  exchange  rate  risks  associated  with  certain  highly  probable  forecast  transactions  (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance,  when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method include investments in subsidiaries and associates.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the subsidiary as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognized its share in the changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the carrying amount of the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any retained investment of the former subsidiary is measured at the fair value at that date. A gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and calculated as the difference between (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and (b) the previous carrying amount of the investments in such subsidiary. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the subsidiary had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\n- 128 -",

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these parent company only financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's shar e of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Compan y's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen the Company transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company's parent company only financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\n- 129 -",

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate s.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\n- 130 -",

Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units or groups of cash -generating units that are expected to benefit. If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n- 131 -",

The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods which is generally when the goods are delive red to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nTreasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders' equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.\n\n- 132 -",

Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from  the  commencement  date  until  the  exercise  date  of  the  option.  Main  factors  considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is rea ssessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n- 134 -",

The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue  and  expenses  related  to  the  specific  asset  groups  with  the  consideration  of  the  nature  of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market riskfree rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\n## a. Defined contribution plans\n\nThe plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the 'Act') is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, the Company has made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly salary to employees' pensi on accounts. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$3,663,757 thousand and NT$3,028,282 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of t he next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                             | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                             | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Current service cost                                                        | $  134,376                | $  145,289                |\n| Net interest expense                                                        | 74,265                    | 47,196                    |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss            | 208,641                   | 192,485                   |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                         |                           |                           |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense) | (429,948)                 | (73,298)                  |\n| Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments                          | 1,413,760                 | 94,278                    |\n|                                                                             |                           | (Continued)               |\n\n- 148 -",

Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nThe Company 's Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by the Company's Board of Directors and reported to the Company's shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, the Company shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals the Company's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the Company 's Articles of Incorporation .\n\nThe Company's Ar ticles of Incorporation also provide that profits of the Company may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\n- 152 -",

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit Committees (rename to Audit and Risk Committee from February 14, 2023)  and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During  the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantially the Company's sales is denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollars, would have an adverse impact on\n\n- 166 -",

        "page_content": "the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These  hedges  reduce,  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate,  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company ' s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$1,649,664 thousand and NT$1,196,014 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its bank deposits and bank loans. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's bank deposits, as well as the interest paid on its bank loans. Because all of the Company's bonds issued are fixed -rate and measured at amortized cost, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$89,297 thousand and NT$87,841 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses  to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of De cember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 69% and 67 % of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment-grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty.

        "page_content": "- b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. The Company's equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, the Company and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, the Company and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. The Company and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC's capacity, but the Company alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required  to  compensate  SSMC  for  all  related  unavoidable  costs.  There  was  no  default  from  the aforementioned commitment as of the end of reporting period.\n- c. In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC ('Daedalus') filed complain ts in the U.S. International Trade Commission ('ITC') and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that the Company, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. The outcome cannot be determined and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.\n- d.
