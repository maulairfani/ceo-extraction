The information Restor provides is helping organizations including Zurich to assess the impact of efforts to protect fragile ecosystems.\n\nBy collecting and sharing detailed information on its platform about individual restoration projects - including forests, wetlands and agriculture - Restor is helping to restore, preserve and maintain global ecosystems and the biodiversity they support. Zurich uses insights from Restor as part of its efforts to support regeneration within a portion of Brazil's threatened Atlantic Forest. Working with Instituto Terra, a Brazilian non-profit founded by awardwinning Brazilian photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia, Zurich is helping bring life back to a 700-hectare portion of the forest - equal to the area covered by about 1,300 U.S. football fields.\n\nZurich Insurance Group (Zurich) is a leading multi-line insurer serving people and businesses in more than 200 countries and territories. Founded 150 years ago, Zurich is transforming insurance. In addition to providing insurance protection, Zurich is increasingly offering prevention services such as those that promote wellbeing and enhance climate resilience.\n\nReflecting its purpose to 'create a brighter future together,' Zurich aspires to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. It is targeting net-zero emissions by 2050 and has the highest-possible ESG rating from MSCI. In 2020, Zurich launched the Zurich Forest project to support reforestation and biodiversity restoration in Brazil.\n\nThe Group has about 60,000 employees and is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (ZURN), is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and has a level I American Depositary Receipt (ZURVY) program, which is traded over-the-counter on OTCQX. Further information is available at www.zurich.com.\n\nI\n\nR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Zurich, we want to create a brighter future together to benefit people and planet. This could mean pursuing net-zero to safeguard the Earth, our only home. It could mean preparing for the effects of climate change and building resilience. For others, it means using the latest technology available to actively manage medical conditions or track fitness to avoid ill-health now or in the future.\n\nWe're working with partners big and small to find solutions to the most pressing societal and environmental problems. And we're making sure we look after all our stakeholders, from investors to customers to employees. By working together, you have the ability to\n\n## shape your future .",

And our customers look to us to support and guide them through these unprecedented times.\n\nThe word 'permacrisis' has been used as far back as the 1920s, but our experience of responding to extended periods of instability and insecurity goes back even further: to 1872. Through geopolitical upheaval, industrial revolution and societal transformation, we have learned that you can find strength in adversity and opportunity within risk. A crisis can force an individual, a business or the world to engage in thoughtful critique that can lead to positive progress.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, forced us to work, learn, communicate and access health and financial services through digital interfaces. It also illuminated the deprivation and the many underlying inequalities that exist within countries and between countries. And it shone a light on the power and beauty of nature and humanity. It taught us that we are capable of remarkable achievements when challenges demand it.\n\nThe future remains uncertain. But our business is incredibly resilient due to the strength, flexibility and resourcefulness of our people.\n\nAs we start a new three-year cycle, my word for the year is 'confidence.' Because our people, our business, have proven time and time again that we excel at managing risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichel M. Li\u00e8s\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Collins Dictionary aptly chose 'permacrisis' as its word of the year for 2022. Meaning an 'extended period of instability and insecurity,' the word could be used to describe the state of the world since the start of the decade and could define this era in its entirety.\n\nCOVID-19 caused a global health crisis and exposed vulnerabilities in international supply chains. Russia's war in Ukraine has polarized the world, triggered energy and food crises, fueled a rise in inflation and leaves us on the brink of a global recession. Meanwhile, the extreme weather events we have witnessed in the past 12 months remind us that climate change is an existential crisis that cannot be ignored.\n\nAll this shows how risks are global and interconnected. One global crisis can cause a cascade - or cluster of interrelated global shocks, often with unpredictable consequences. Energy security has displaced energy transition at the top of the political agenda, and while this could exacerbate climate change it may help us to accelerate the development of renewables.",

Customer satisfaction is rising and we have recaptured market share in business units like Switzerland and Germany, where we have been growing at above-market rates, with good profitability.\n\n## New financial cycle\n\nIn November, we presented our new financial targets to shareholders and raised our ambitions for the next three years. During 2023-2025, we are planning a significant acceleration of our customer-centered strategy by taking advantage of data and innovation.\n\nIn the commercial segment, we want to gain even more relevance to customers and improve Zurich's competitive position. We plan to continue to diversify the business by leveraging our data platform and a new organizational setup to grow in the midmarket space.\n\n## Dear shareholder,\n\nZurich marked its 150-year anniversary in 2022, an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable journey from newcomer to an industry leader. It was an era of extremes - from world wars to extraordinary technological advances - yet time and again, we emerged from challenges leaner, more agile and poised for future success.\n\nOur long history is an inspiration that has served us well in our more recent past. When we laid out our plans for 2020-2022, nobody could have foreseen that this period would see a global pandemic, a war in Europe and one of the worst-ever years for natural catastrophes. Despite all that, we delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return to you, our shareholder, by adapting rapidly to changing circumstances.\n\nAnd we did so while staying focused on supporting our customers, colleagues and communities. I am immensely proud of our over 60,000 employees for what we have achieved and how we achieved it, for acting in ways that do credit to our rich history. They deserve our heartfelt thanks and praise.\n\n## Simplicity, innovation, customer focus\n\nThe year 2022 ended the second three-year cycle of our strategy to transform Zurich into a simpler, more innovative and truly customer centric organization. Because of the way our industry has traditionally operated through intermediaries, it has always been difficult for insurers to be truly customer-focused.

Central to this is the goal to accelerate the transition toward net-zero emissions, and to work with our customers and investee companies to make the transition together. One of our fastest-growing businesses is Zurich Resilience Solutions, created in 2021 to help commercial customers become more resilient to new and emerging risks including climate change.\n\nWe continue to take resolute action to reduce emissions in our own operations, from limiting air travel and switching to renewable power, to converting our fleet to electric vehicles and making our real estate more energy efficient. Our success has allowed us to bring forward by 20 years our target to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations.\n\nOur people have been enthusiastic supporters of these efforts. An initiative that has helped mobilize employees around the world is our Zurich Forest project in Brazil.

Over the next three years, we want to keep our focus on innovation to provide valuable services for our customers, further reduce complexity and volatility, and continue to run the business for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n\nWe have proven our ability to rise to challenges.

When I arrived as Group CEO in 2016, the strong, long-term relationships between Zurich and its commercial customers was a key differentiator for us as an insurer. For the last six years, we have been working to extend the same principles to our relationships with our retail customers. We are doing this because serving our customers well is the right thing to do and also because it generates value for our shareholders and the business as a whole.\n\n## Why will you continue to focus on simplification?\n\nSimplification is a key part of our strategy and is based on the very straightforward principle that Zurich is all about the business and customers. We will continue to reduce complexity and bureaucracy in the organization and in the way we interact with customers. That's where innovation comes in. We need to digitalize in order to offer customers a way to easily interact with us, we need to be swift in responding to their needs and eliminate everything that slows us down. To stay competitive, we also need to make sure customers don't pay for inefficiencies and that we focus resources on what adds value to them.\n\n## How does Zurich's strategy dovetail with environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles?\n\nWe take ESG seriously and aim to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. For 2023, we refreshed our sustainability framework to ensure our actions are timely and continue to address all three letters of ESG. We are growing our range of sustainable products and services to help customers make choices that benefit people and planet. We've also invested in reskilling and upskilling our employees, an important element of our company culture that will help us stay agile and relevant for today's customers. And we will continue to embed our values and principles to always do what's right throughout the business.\n\n13\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are we looking to achieve next?\n\n## Our targets for 2023-2025\n\nWe are building on our track record of strong delivery in challenging times and raising the bar for customer experience, simplifying the business and driving innovation as we set ambitious new financial targets for the next three years.\n\nBOPAT ROE 1\n\n>20%\n\nCumulative cash remittances\n\n>USD 13.5bn\n\nSST ratio 3\n\n\u2265160%\n\nCompound organic earnings per share growth 5\n\n8%",

Our business model is based on five key elements: serving customers and curating a well-established ecosystem; understanding and underwriting risks; managing reserves; investing and delivering returns; and managing claims.\n\nOur risk advisory business, called Zurich Resilience Solutions, helps corporate customers mitigate potential risks and Zurich Global Ventures is accelerating the development of innovative, digital services across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n14\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our customers\n\nRead more:\n\npage 24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur\n\nemployees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more:\n\npage 25\n\n<!-- image -->",

Trusted customer relationships mean we are better able to provide advice and solutions that meet the individual needs of our customers in an ever-evolving risk landscape.\n\n## Understand and underwrite risks\n\nInsuring risks is central to what we do. Our underwriting expertise, knowledge and skill, accumulated over decades of experience and backed by a wealth of data, gives us the ability to assess, understand and quantify risks at all levels of complexity. This enables us to offer fairly priced, appropriate insurance solutions to our customers, as well as provide insights to support them in managing their risks and mitigating potential losses. As trusted long-term partners, we stay close to our customers to better understand their individual needs, and where possible equip them with the right tools to navigate any challenges they face.\n\nWe have deployed technology throughout the organization to improve how we engage with our customers and support our underwriters in providing a superior service. We constantly make improvements to the day-to-day environment for our underwriters by seeking and acting on their feedback. This reduces turnover and helps us to retain experienced people within the organization, helping us to maintain the strong technical capabilities that our customers expect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Manage reserves\n\nOur Group-wide policy, the 'Zurich Way of Reserving', with well-defined standards and conservative approach, is the basis for how we calculate insurance liabilities. Our reserving process is supported by strong governance, including extensive internal and external reviews.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Invest\n\nOur income includes returns from invested premiums, policy fees and deposits. Our success as a business is important to those who depend on us to pay claims reliably, as well as investors who look to us to deliver savings returns and operate our business responsibly.\n\nZurich's approach to managing investments aims to maximize risk-based returns relative to the Group's liabilities, while understanding emerging risks in challenging times. That is why we manage our assets responsibly and do this by integrating environmental, social and governance factors in our investment decisions.\n\n15\n\n## Zurich Resilience Solutions\n\nZurich Resilience Solutions is a global risk consultancy business unit that supports customers with solutions that go beyond risk transfer. In a rapidly evolving risk landscape, we provide customers with services that help them prevent and mitigate risks and sometimes even make uninsurable risk insurable again. Our 850 risk experts work with customers to support them develop and deliver their risk management strategies, using specialized insights, tools and services to tackle both traditional and emerging risks.\n\n## Zurich Global Ventures\n\nZurich Global Ventures is accelerating our development of innovative and digital services that will empower customers to choose insurance they value most. Its portfolio comprises solutions in travel, health and well-being, employee benefits, cyber and device protection. These businesses include Cover-More, LiveWell by Zurich and Zurich Integrated Benefits & International Life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Manage claims\n\nIt is vital our customers have faith and confidence in our ability to fulfill our commitments. Experience and a reputation built over decades mean our customers can trust us to use our expertise to support them in their time of need, responding swiftly, keeping them informed throughout their journey, and settling the claim fairly.\n\nWe are constantly seeking new ways to respond to our customers' expectations of service, offering a choice of communication channels and self-service capabilities. We innovate to respond to their changing needs and enhance the sustainability of the services we deliver. We strive to deliver insights to customers to help them mitigate and even avoid future losses.\n\nWe systematically analyze customer feedback using a range of engagement opportunities, including net promoter system (NPS) programs, not only as part of our claims process but throughout all key customer touchpoints.",

You have to explain what it means and how you achieve it. You must come up with a compelling vision and then set standards, create processes and launch initiatives that will change mindsets and ways of working. Once you've done that, you need to set targets for how to get there and then measure and reward your people when they're driving in the right direction.\n\n## What has your Customer Office team achieved since you joined Zurich in 2019?\n\nWe refreshed our brand purpose and visual identity and created a new and more engaging customer value proposition that builds an emotional connection. We developed a vision for customer experience, or CX, aimed at building meaningful relationships and not just transactions - with our customers. We also created new capabilities. For instance, we established customer offices across the Group to drive this transformation and we set up a customer academy to train our people. I'm very pleased to say we've seen progress.\n\nIn the last year we gained 2.1 million net new customers, customer satisfaction - measured by TNPS - is up almost 7 percent.\n\n## What are your focus areas for the 2023-25 cycle?\n\nOur priorities are to drive customer loyalty and deliver relevant experiences to our customers in a way that they can feel the difference. To do that, we're upgrading our customer segmentation and lead management processes and introducing a new portal for our customers where we can engage with them directly.\n\n## Why are you focusing on customer loyalty?\n\nLoyal customers tend to have higher product density and if they have a great experience they will recommend us to others, so it makes economic sense for Zurich. And we should reward these customers for their loyalty, which is not common in the insurance industry. We're strong at building customer loyalty in Commercial Insurance, but we have plenty of opportunity to improve in Retail Insurance.\n\n## How important is data to this goal?\n\nData analytics is key to driving our customer ambitions. Data gives us a much more refined picture of our customers, where they are, how they behave and how we can service them better. Over time, as we improve the understanding of our customers, we'll be able to deliver a more personalized experience that will also drive greater loyalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## With the world seemingly in a 'permacrisis,' do you still feel optimistic?\n\nAbsolutely! We still live in an exciting and inspiring world. We have many short- and long-term risks that challenge our lives. But let's be forward thinking. Let's be confident. Let's reframe risks as opportunities so we can help people, businesses and communities build confidence today to take positive action for tomorrow.\n\n## Connecting with our customers is helping us to build meaningful relationships.\n\nConny Kalcher Group Chief Customer Officer",

Our success over the last few years gives me the confidence that we can do even better and live up to high expectations from customers, markets and colleagues.\n\n## Is strategy just a buzzword?\n\nThe word 'strategy' can be a buzzword. But all successful companies (like ours) have a clear vision of what they want to be. And this simple, compelling vision is what drives their decision making. For me, strategy is about taking decisions and choosing priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategy provides a simple, compelling vision that drives our decision making.\n\nPaolo Mantero Group Chief Strategy Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen I hear a company has 10 priorities, I know they don't have a strategy, only a wish list. Strategy is not about the 'what,' but the 'how' - especially the 'how' do we get from where we are to where we want to be. To use a mountaineering analogy, strategy is not looking at the highest peak and saying, 'let's go for it.' It's about drawing a map that shows you how to get to the highest peak from your current location, ensuring you are properly equipped and trained, and that you are considering all potential obstacles that you need to overcome to get to the top.\n\n## We're following the same strategy for a third cycle. What does that say about our strategy?\n\nWe should not confuse our strategy with the financial cycle. The rhythm of our cycle sets our financial targets every three years. However, these targets must be justified by a sound strategy. While changing market conditions require us to adapt our action plan with the ability to respond tactically, a robust strategy, like ours, has a longer life span and does not change with each three-year cycle. Today, we still have more opportunities to simplify our business, to build an even stronger innovation mindset and to further elevate our customer offerings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What stands out for you from 2022?\n\n2022 was a very tough year for many reasons. In this challenging context, what stands out for me is our ability to quickly adapt and respond to these circumstances, while remaining focused on our strategic goals. During the past year, we grew our customer base, increased customer loyalty and have reaffirmed ourselves as a true leader in the commercial market. And we did all of this while continuing to deliver consistently solid financial outcomes. This is a sign that we are an incredibly strong company, which, at its 150th anniversary, can still look at its future with confidence.",

The insurer receives premiums from customers to cover a particular risk and pays out claims when things go wrong. Zurich Global Ventures works differently: We start with thinking about how our customers can reduce their risk of something going wrong in the first place. We help customers avoid risks, mitigate the potential impact of risks, and overcome any consequences of risks that happen.\n\n## How do we meet the needs of our customers?\n\nCustomers want financial security if something goes wrong and the confidence to know that they can overcome difficulties. We focus on building products and services for customers to give them this confidence, be it during a vacation (see Freely on page 21) or over the course of a lifetime with our health and well-being proposition, LiveWell.\n\nLiveWell is about designing products to help people make health a habit. Achieving better health, be it physically, mentally, or financially, is often difficult for all of us because it requires discipline, and the rewards are usually far out in the future.\n\nThrough LiveWell, we encourage people to embed health into their lifestyles, whether it's taking care of their mind by meditating, getting enough sleep, moving on a regular basis or managing chronic illnesses like diabetes (see Pops Diabetes Care on page 5). We want our customers to avoid ill health and live longer, happier and healthier lives.\n\nHow do you go about creating a startup mindset within a large company like Zurich?\n\nFor me this is about a willingness to explore and innovate. It starts with asking the right questions. If we ask ourselves 'what did we learn?' we encourage people to experiment and apply that knowledge to the next project.\n\n## What will Zurich Global Ventures focus on in the next three years?\n\nThe next three years is all about growth: investing and partnering to bring the right capabilities to life. We want to serve more customers and to bring more services to existing customers. I really look forward to dramatically expanding our presence and creating opportunities for both our customers and business partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We want to build services that give our customers confidence.\n\nJack Howell CEO, Zurich Global Ventures\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich is helping Japan's seniors to maintain their independence by offering them accident insurance specifically tailored to them, setting an example for other countries with aging populations. 'We believe we are making a contribution to society as Japan's population continues to age,' says Hiromasa Takeuchi, Senior Manager of Wholesale Business, who helped to develop the product offered by Zurich's Japanese Property & Casualty (P&C) business. Zurich's senior personal accident insurance policy resonates with active seniors in a country where typical accident insurance cover is limited to people 75 years or younger. More than a third of the Zurich product's policyholders are older than 80, and unlike products sold by most peers, Zurich's can be continued until the customer reaches the age of 100.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSimplification\n\nInnovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making it simpler for businesses to connect with Zurich\n\n## A travel insurance you can toggle on and off\n\nZurich launched Zurich eXchange, a global repository of APIs that allows customers, distributors and partners to seamlessly integrate products from Zurich into a single, all-in-one platform. The platform publishes Zurich's Application Programming Interfaces (API), which are used by computer programmers to allow different software to communicate with one another effectively. This enables more efficient collaboration throughout Zurich and with customers and partners, helping computer programmers avoid complex point-to-point integrations of different Zurich services and products. At the same time, the Zurich eXchange will oversee that the APIs are easy to use, well-managed and secure.\n\n1,433 Number of APIs under management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFreely is a travel insurance, safety and experience app that targets a new wave of modern, ethical travelers with flexible, transparent policies. Launched in Australia in 2021 and offered by Cover-More, Freely began its global expansion last year, launching in the U.S. in July 2022. Freely is an innovative app that easily engages with customers and exemplifies Zurich's digital strategy. It gives customers the ability to purchase day-to-day policies and toggle coverage on and off in near real time for activities such as winter sports and adventure activities, allowing travelers to pay only for what they need, when they need it. Travelers can also access geo-specific travel and safety alerts on the go and connect to a human 24/7 for medical and crisis assistance. Leveraging the existing global infrastructure and capabilities of Cover-More and Zurich, Freely has the potential to create an ecosystem of services delivered direct to the retail customer.\n\n300,000 Number of customers using Cover-More's travel apps\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n21",

The building is sustainable in terms of its use of materials, will produce energy from solar panels on the roof and will also offer a large number of bike parking spaces and electric vehicle-charging stations to enable tenants to commute sustainably.

As well as providing faster, more convenient and efficient claims settlements, the team also distributed flood aid kits to support affected customers. Thanks to the proactive approach and a simplified claims process applied by our teams, Zurich in Malaysia have been recognized for their best-in-class turnaround time and settlement approach - even winning Claims Initiative of the Year 2022 from the Insurance Asia Awards and Malaysia Customer Experience of the Year in Financial Services (Insurance) from the Asia Experience Awards 2022.\n\n## USD 1.5bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping customers build better work environments\n\nZurich Resilience Solutions (ZRS) delivers many innovative services worldwide.

In just four weeks, the campaign raised CHF 2 million (including matching from the Foundation) to help the victims of the crisis. The amount raised from individual donations was the largest in the Foundation's history.\n\nIn total, the Foundation has made more than 20 donations to smaller local and international organizations assisting people affected by the crisis, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Rescue Committee, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Save the Children.\n\nThe Foundation is also supporting refugees in coping with the consequences of their fragile and extremely vulnerable situation, for example, by supporting young people's mental well-being, as well as tackling social inequalities resulting from the war's consequences on Ukrainian youth.\n\n'From raising funds and in-kind donations, to driving to the borders and opening their homes, we have been impressed by the dedication from Zurich employees worldwide to assist the people fleeing Ukraine,' said Head of the Z Zurich Foundation Gregory Renand.

The war has polarized the world, triggered energy and food crises, fueled a rise in inflation and has left us on the brink of a global recession.\n\nIt feels like we are in a perpetual state of crisis; of lurching from one emergency to another.\n\nIn this period of volatility, our sound and stable corporate governance frameworks and good decision-making are more important than ever. The Swiss Corporate Law Reform supports this stability and aims to modernize corporate governance by strengthening shareholder rights and giving companies more flexibility regarding their share capital. Accordingly, we will propose several changes to the Articles of Association at the shareholders' meeting in April 2023, embracing the spirit of modernization.\n\n## A refreshed sustainability framework\n\nThe war has thrust the issue of energy security and energy affordability to the top of the political agenda. But this must not come at the expense of energy transition and other sustainability measures.\n\nThe extreme weather events we have witnessed in the past 12 months remind us that climate change is an existential crisis and cannot be ignored.\n\nTo ensure we maintain our focus on such issues, we are enhancing our environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach by updating our sustainability framework.\n\nIn 2022, we once again performed a materiality assessment to identify what issues are most relevant to our business. The assessment ensures our ESG priorities continue to meet external expectations and create sustainable value for our shareholders, the planet and society. We surveyed more than 8,000 employees, 500 retail customers, 20 commercial customers and a representative number of NGO partners, industry associations and investors. Based on their feedback, we have refreshed our sustainability framework with clear and bold targets, new investment priorities and road maps that plot out actions we intend to take from 2023 to 2025.\n\nThis framework reinforces our ambition to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world, with a clear focus on accelerating and embedding sustainability for customers across our business units as a source of growth for our next strategic cycle.\n\n## 150 years and counting\n\nLast October we celebrated our 150-year anniversary. It was an opportunity to look back on our history, ahead to our future and to put current turbulent events into context.\n\nDespite the challenges the world faces today, we should look forward to our next 150 years with confidence. Our business has thrived despite having to endure world wars, natural disasters, financial crises and pandemics. Throughout our history, we remained a beacon of stability and grew stronger by staying nimble, adapting to change and seeing opportunity in risk.\n\nWe have managed to shape our industry and earn the trust of our customers, communities and families worldwide. And we have always proactively addressed environmental and societal concerns through our philanthropy, internal policies and ESG strategy.\n\nI am confident these traits will serve us well in the years ahead.\n\nThank you for your continued trust, support and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe refreshed sustainability framework places stronger emphasis on societal issues. The experience of Peter Maurer (former President of the International Committee of the Red Cross), who assumed his role as a member of the Board of Directors in October 2022, will ensure humanitarian and social issues are prominent in our ESG thinking.\n\n## Board changes\n\n## Executive Committee changes\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on April 6, 2022, we welcomed Peter Maurer as a new Board member.

Structures, rules and processes are designed to enable proper conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of its corporate bodies and employees. Our structures provide for checks and balances and institutional separation between the Board and the Group chief executive officer (Group CEO) as well as the Executive Committee (ExCo) which together are responsible for managing the Group on a day-to-day basis.\n\nZurich's corporate governance principles are described in a number of corporate documents, in particular in the Articles of Association, the Organizational Rules and the Charter of the Committees of the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (Organizational Rules) (www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents). Zurich also complies with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance (Swiss Code of Best Practice) issued by economiesuisse. The Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee (GNSC) regularly reviews the Group's corporate governance against best practice standards.\n\nEffective corporate governance is complemented by a remuneration system that fosters the right behaviors. Information on remuneration, shareholdings and loans to Board and ExCo members is contained in the remuneration report (see pages 74 to 111).\n\n## Supervision\n\nZurich is subject to insurance group supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). The Swiss insurance regulation requires Swiss insurance companies and groups to establish and maintain strong governance and risk management systems, as well as effective internal control systems appropriate to their business activities. It prescribes the calculation of a risk-based solvency margin on a Group-wide basis and at legal entity level pursuant to the Swiss Solvency Test (SST).

Certain group companies have listed debt issued under its Euro Medium-Term Note Programme and other financial instruments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the ordinary share capital of ZIG amounted to CHF 15,046,016.70 divided into 150,460,167 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each. The market capitalization as of December 31, 2022 was CHF 66,548,351,864.\n\nZIG has an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) level 1 program with The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). 1 As of December 31, 2022, investors held 25,357,930 ADRs (representing 2,535,793 ZIG shares).\n\nPlease refer to page 313 for information about treasury shares. Further information on ZIG's shares can also be found under: www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares.\n\n## Authorized and contingent share capital\n\nOn April 6, 2022, the AGM approved a renewal of the authorized share capital for another two years (from April 2022 to April 6, 2024). Until and including April 6, 2024, the Board is authorized to increase the share capital by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each (art. 5 bis ). This authorized share capital corresponds to about 30 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2022. Share issuances from authorized share capital where the shareholders' subscription rights are restricted or excluded are limited to 14,960,800 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2022).\n\nFurthermore, the share capital of ZIG may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing up to 29,921,600 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights, which are granted in connection with the issuance of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'financial instruments') by ZIG or one of its group companies, or by mandatory conversion of financial instruments issued by ZIG or one of its group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of ZIG, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders (art. 5 ter para. 1a). This contingent share capital corresponds to about 20 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2022.\n\nUntil and including April 6, 2024, the total number of new shares which could be issued from (i) authorized share capital under art. 5 bis para. 4 where the subscription rights are restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with financial instruments under art. 5 ter para. 1 where the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded is limited to 14,960,800 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2022).\n\nMoreover, there is an additional contingent share capital (art. 5 ter para. 2a) of CHF 409,509.20, representing 4,095,092 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, which may be issued to employees of ZIG or one of its group companies. This contingent share capital corresponds to about 2.7 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2022.\n\nFor further information, see art. 5 bis and 5 ter of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/ articles-of-association) and the audited consolidated financial statements, note 19 on pages 312 to 314.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For information on employee share plans, see the audited consolidated financial statements, note 21 on pages 324 to 325.\n\n## Cross-shareholdings\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, ZIG had no cross shareholdings in excess of 5 percent of share capital, or voting rights with any other company.\n\n## Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations\n\nThere are no limitations on transferability except for the following:\n\nRegistration as a shareholder requires a declaration that the shareholder has acquired the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account (art. 7 para. 2 of the Articles of Association, www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/ articles-of-association). Nominees holding ZIG shares may for the benefit of, or as nominee for another person, be registered for up to 200,000 shares with voting rights, notwithstanding that the nominee does not disclose the identity of the beneficial owner. A nominee, however, is entitled to be registered as a shareholder with voting rights of more than 200,000 shares if the nominee discloses the identity of each beneficial owner and informs the beneficial owners about corporate actions, consults as to the exercise of voting rights and pre-emptive rights, transfers dividends and acts in the interests of and in accordance with the instructions of the beneficial owners.\n\nThere are special provisions relating to the registration and exercise of rights attached to shares held by BNYM in connection with the ADR program.\n\n## Close periods\n\nUnder Zurich's Group Policy on Dealing in Securities (the Policy), persons qualifying as Group insiders are prohibited from dealing in Zurich securities during periods Zurich has designated as 'close periods'. Close periods are those periods (of a minimum of 30 days) leading up to and including the trading day of the announcement of the Group's quarterly, half-year and annual results. In practice, close periods last approximately 40 days with a longer time span over year-end.\n\nIn addition, dealing restrictions during prohibited periods apply to insiders who are involved in (potentially) pricesensitive projects. Outside of close and prohibited periods, Group insiders may deal in Zurich securities with prior clearance from Group Compliance.\n\n## Persons in scope\n\nSenior executives (such as e.g. ExCo members, head of certain Group functions) and the members of the Board of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (ZIG) and of certain significant subsidiaries are deemed Group insiders by reason of their positions.\n\nAdditional persons can be designated as Group insiders based on the persons' exposure to potentially price-sensitive information regarding Zurich securities. Zurich keeps a list of these individuals.\n\nFurthermore, Group insiders must ensure that connected persons (such as spouse, life or civil partner, minor child, financial advisor, affiliated company, etc.) do not deal in Zurich securities during close and prohibited periods.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The term 'securities' includes:\n\n- - Securities admitted to trading on a stock exchange or an institution similar to a stock exchange in and outside Switzerland;\n- - Securities traded on the primary (e.g., initial public offering) and secondary market;\n- - Over-the-counter (OTC) financial instruments (e.g., ADRs, derivatives);\n- - Financial instruments deriving from securities whose price is materially dependent (i.e., Zurich securities weigh more than 20 percent) on the underlying security, including debt instruments.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nDuring a close or prohibited period, clearance to sell may be granted to the Group insider if the Group insider is not in possession of inside information about Zurich and there is an exceptional circumstance (such as a personal or family emergency involving a health matter or legal or financial emergency) in which selling Zurich securities is the only reasonably available course of action for the Group insider. The determination whether circumstances are deemed exceptional is made by the Group chief compliance officer and the chairman.\n\nFurthermore, provided the requirements of the Policy are met, periodic investments based on a pre-defined trading plan do not require clearance and may continue during close and prohibited periods.\n\n## Significant shareholders\n\nAccording to the rules on disclosure of significant shareholdings in Swiss listed companies, a shareholding has to be disclosed if certain thresholds starting at 3 percent are reached, exceeded or if the shareholding subsequently falls below those thresholds. ZIG is obliged to announce third party shareholdings upon receipt of a notification that the shareholding has reached, exceeded or fallen below the relevant thresholds. During 2022, the Group received a notification from UBS Fund Management (Switzerland) AG whose shareholding crossed the 3 percent threshold and a subsequent notification that the shareholding has fallen below the 3 percent threshold.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, ZIG was not aware of any person or institution, other than BlackRock, Inc., New York (> 5 percent) and The Capital Group Companies, Inc., Los Angeles (> 5 percent), which, directly or indirectly, had an interest as a beneficial owner in shares, option rights and/or conversion rights relating to shares of ZIG reaching or exceeding the relevant thresholds.\n\nThe announcements related to these notifications can be found via the SIX Disclosure Office's platform: www.six-exchange-regulation.com/en/home/publications/significant-shareholders.html.\n\nZIG is not aware of any person or institution which, as of December 31, 2022, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, exercised or was a party to any arrangements to exercise control over ZIG.\n\n## Duty to make an offer\n\nThe Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association) do not provide for opting out or opting up in the meaning of the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act. Therefore, mandatory offers have to be submitted when a shareholder or a group of shareholders acting in concert exceeds 33 1/3 percent ownership of the issued and outstanding share capital of ZIG.\n\n## Clauses on changes of control\n\nThe employment agreements with ExCo members are subject to a maximum notice period of 12 months. The regulations for the Group's share-based long-term incentive plan, which apply to all of the plan's participants including ExCo members and a defined group of senior managers, provide that in case of a change of control, the plan administrator may at its discretion either roll over existing share obligations into new share rights or provide for consideration in lieu of share obligations, or provide for accelerated vesting and removal of sales restrictions.\n\nThere are no further clauses pertaining to change of control that would benefit Board members, ExCo members, or other members of senior management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each share (excluding treasury shares) further entitles all shareholders to dividend payments. The ZIG Board will propose to the shareholders at the AGM on April 6, 2023 a gross dividend of CHF 24 per share (excluding treasury shares).\n\n## Voting rights restrictions and representation\n\nThere are no voting rights restrictions (other than set out under 'Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations', see page 36).\n\nA shareholder with voting rights can attend shareholders' meetings in person or duly authorize his or her legal representative, another person who need not be a shareholder, or the independent voting rights representative. Shareholders can order their admission card or authorize a representative either in writing or via the online platform of Computershare Switzerland Ltd.\n\nThe AGM elects the independent voting rights representative for a term of office until conclusion of the next AGM. The independent voting rights representative may be re-elected.\n\nZIG generally informs the shareholders at the beginning of the shareholders' meeting of the aggregate number of shares represented by shareholders or their representatives physically attending the meeting and the number of shares represented by the independent voting rights representative. However, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ZIG decided that shareholders could not attend the AGM on April 6, 2022 in person, but only exercise their voting rights by instructing the independent voting rights representative in writing or electronically. ZIG informed its registered shareholders accordingly.\n\n## Statutory quora\n\nPursuant to art. 15 of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association), the AGM constitutes a quorum irrespective of the number of shareholders present and shares represented. Resolutions and elections generally require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes represented, unless respective provisions in the Articles of Association (of which there are currently none) or mandatory legal provisions stipulate otherwise. Art. 704 of the Swiss Code of Obligations provides for a two-thirds majority of votes represented and an absolute majority of the nominal value of shares represented for certain important matters, such as a change of the company's purpose or domicile, the dissolution of the company and certain matters relating to capital increases.\n\n## Convening of shareholders' meetings\n\nShareholders' meetings are convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor and other bodies in accordance with the provisions set out in art. 699 and 700 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Shareholders with voting rights representing at least 10 percent of the share capital may call a shareholders' meeting, indicating the matters to be discussed and the corresponding proposals. The invitation to shareholders is mailed to registered shareholders at least 20 calendar days before the meeting is held and, in addition, is published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\n## Agenda\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the agenda. Shareholders with voting rights who together represent shares with a nominal value of at least CHF 10,000 may request, no later than 45 days before the day of the meeting, that specific items be included in the agenda. Such request must be made in writing, and must specify the proposals.\n\n## Registrations in the share register\n\nTo ensure an orderly process, the Board determines the date on which a shareholder needs to be registered in the share register in order to attend the shareholders' meeting. That date is published, together with the invitation to the shareholders' meeting, in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich's independence criteria comply with applicable laws and reflect best-practice standards such as the SIX Exchange Regulation Directive on Information relating to Corporate Governance and Swiss Code of Best Practice. The GNSC reviews Board members' independence status annually and reports its findings to the Board for final determination. The GNSC checks the independence criteria before recommending a new Board member for election and, thereafter, for re-election on an annual basis. It confirms in particular that in 2022 and the past three years:\n\n- - no Board member (other than in their capacity as Board or committee member), member of their immediate family, or any other related party, received - either directly or indirectly - any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees;\n- - no Board members or any member of their immediate family, are or were employed by a member of the Group;\n- - no Board member is or was employed or affiliated with the external auditor;\n- - no Board member has had a material direct or indirect relationship with any member of the Group.\n\nUpon the recommendation of the GNSC, the Board determined that, as of February 9, 2022, all Board members were non-executive and independent from management. For further information on the independence policy, please see art. 16.6 of the Annex to the Organizational Rules (www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents). Board members are also subject to rules and regulations to avoid conflicts of interest and misuse of insider information.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nIt is a key consideration for the Board to ensure that it continues to act as a strategic asset enabling anticipation of risks and opportunities as well as providing oversight and control particularly by preserving and increasing the Board's diversity.\n\nTo achieve this, the Chairman, supported by the GNSC, on a yearly basis leads a structured succession planning process involving an assessment of the Group's challenges and opportunities and the evaluation of skills, knowledge and expertise needed at present and in the foreseeable future. In 2022, the GNSC held a series of meetings dedicated to discussing all of these factors and assess the potential succession needs of the Board and its committees. The GNSC identified the succession of the Audit Committee's chairperson as a priority.\n\nDuring succession planning discussions, the Board focuses on: skills, expertise, diversity and background, interplay of a candidate's individual personality, expertise and experience with that of incumbent Board members, high values and integrity and ability to commit adequate time (for further information, see Nomination Principles in art. 15 ff. of the Annex to the Organizational Rules under www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board members discussed the results and defined actions to address the feedback received.\n\n## Meetings\n\nDuring 2022, the Board held 12 meetings (of which 11 were partly attended by tele-/videoconference and seven were held over two days.

Various governance and control functions help to ensure that risks are identified and appropriately managed and that internal controls are in place and operating effectively. The Board is ultimately responsible for the supervision of these activities. The Board supervises management and monitors its performance through reporting and controlling processes. It receives regular and timely information on developments relevant to the Group as further described in this section.\n\nAlthough each governance and control function maintains its distinct mandate, the functions are closely aligned and cooperate with each other through a regular exchange of information, planning and other activities. This approach supports management in its responsibilities and provides confidence that risks are appropriately addressed.\n\nZurich uses a model of three lines of defense in its approach to enterprise risk management. This model runs through Zurich's governance structure, so that risks are clearly identified, assessed, owned, managed and monitored.\n\n## Three lines of defense at Zurich Insurance Group as of December 31, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First Line: Business management\n\nThe first line of defense consists of business management and all functions except Group Risk Management, Group Compliance and Group Audit. The first line takes risks and is responsible for day-to-day risk management (i.e., risks are identified and monitored, mitigation actions are implemented and internal controls are in place and operating effectively).\n\nThe Group CEO and other executives inform the Board through regular reports, including on key performance indicators and other Group-relevant financial data, existing and emerging risks, important market developments, industry peers and other significant events. The Group CEO attends Board meetings ex officio. ExCo members are regularly invited to Board or Board committee meetings, while other executives attend these meetings from time to time. Most Board and Board committee meetings include private sessions without management participation.\n\nDuring 2022, the Chairman regularly met with the Group CEO. The Chairman meets from time to time with other ExCo members and management outside regular Board meetings. The other Board members do so as well, including meetings with the Group CFO and the Group CRO, in particular.\n\nThe Group has an information and financial reporting system. The annual plan for the Group, which includes a summary of financial and operational metrics, is reviewed by the ExCo in detail and approved by the Board. Full-year forecasts are revised, if necessary, to reflect changes in sensitivities and risks that may affect the results of the Group. Action is taken, where appropriate, when variances arise. This information is reviewed regularly by the ExCo and the Board.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance and control functions (continued)\n\n## Second Line: Group Risk Management and Group Compliance\n\nThe second line of defense consists of the two control functions, Group Risk Management and Group Compliance.\n\n## Group Risk Management\n\nGroup Risk Management is responsible for supporting the development, implementation and maintenance of Zurich's enterprise risk management framework. The Group CRO regularly reports risk matters to senior management committees, the Group CEO and the Risk and Investment Committee (e.g. in the form of quarterly risk reports and updates). For information regarding the Group's enterprise risk management and internal control framework, see the risk review on pages 198 to 229. The Group no longer separately describes this information in this corporate governance report.\n\n## Group Compliance\n\nGroup Compliance enables business management to manage its compliance risks by providing compliance solutions and independent challenge, monitoring and assurance related to relevant processes and controls, new business opportunities and complex transactions. The Group Compliance mandate includes:\n\n- - Enabling the business to manage its compliance risks.\n- - Being a trusted advisor.\n- - Providing independent challenge, monitoring and assurance.\n- - Assisting management to promote compliance culture and ethics.\n\nGroup Compliance is vertically integrated to support a global framework and is led by the Group chief compliance officer who reports directly into the Group CEO while maintaining functional independence as second line of defense. The Group chief compliance officer has direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and appropriate access to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nGroup Compliance provides an independent view on the key compliance risks to the business and performs independent risk-based monitoring and assurance activities, while also challenging the business operations. Group Compliance performs its activities according to the Global Annual Compliance Plan. Each Annual Compliance Plan (global, regional, local) is a risk-based plan and must be prepared on the basis of an independent forward-looking compliance risk assessment, considering both internal and external key risk drivers.\n\nGroup Compliance also provides compliance risk insight through relevant and targeted reporting. It provides the ExCo and the Audit Committee with insights into key compliance trends, issues and risks as well as on progress against the Global Annual Compliance Plan through quarterly reporting to enable the members of the respective bodies to take informed business decisions. The equivalent regional and local governance bodies receive insights into relevant compliance topics, including progress against the respective risk-based plans. These reporting flows ensure that the organization at all levels embeds the findings and activities of Group Compliance to safeguard against regulatory and business risk exposure.\n\nThe Group chief compliance officer defines and issues compliance policies relevant to the Group and establishes appropriate processes and guidance. Group Compliance supports a strong compliance culture across the Group via training and awareness initiatives and maintains the global concerns reporting mechanism. Zurich encourages its employees to speak up and report improper conduct that they believe is illegal, unethical, or violates the Zurich Code of Conduct or our Group's policies. Employees are free to report their concerns to management, Human Resources, Group Legal, Group Compliance, or through the Zurich Ethics Line (or similar service provided locally), a phone and web-based service run by an independent external provider. Zurich does not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports concerns in good faith.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group Audit has no operational responsibilities for the areas it reviews and, to ensure independence, all Group Audit staff ultimately report to the Group chief auditor. In some instances, local heads of audit for subsidiaries also have a reporting line to the local CEO and/or subsidiary audit committee chair to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nGroup Audit develops a risk-based plan and continuously updates it as the risks faced by the business change. The plan is based on the full spectrum of business risks including issues raised by the Audit Committee, management and other stakeholders. The Audit Committee approves the plan annually and any changes to the plan are reviewed and approved quarterly. The audit plan for 2022 comprised 447 audits, addressing key risks and regulatory requirements, across the Group.\n\nGroup Audit is authorized to review all areas of the Group and has unrestricted access to all Group activities, accounts, records, property and personnel necessary to fulfill its duties. Group Audit coordinates its activities with Group Risk Management, Group Compliance and the external auditors, sharing risk assessments, work plans, audit reports and updates on audit actions.\n\nGroup Audit executes its plan in accordance with defined operating standards, which incorporate and comply with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). Group Audit ensures that issues identified by Group Audit are brought to the attention of appropriate levels of management and that timely follow-up action occurs. The Group chief auditor meets monthly with the Group CEO. The Audit Committee and audit committees of subsidiary companies are informed at least quarterly of important audit findings, including adverse opinions and status of mitigation actions by management. This is supported by the Group chief auditor's attendance at each Audit Committee meeting and monthly meetings between the Group chief auditor and the Chairperson of the Audit Committee and with the Chairperson of the Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the independence of Group Audit and reviews its activities, plans, organization, work quality and its cooperation with the external auditors. As required by IIA Standards, the internal audit function's quality is reviewed at least every five years by an independent qualified assessor. This review was conducted most recently in the second half of 2021 and reported to the Audit Committee in February 2022. The results confirmed that Group Audit's practices are generally conforming to the Institute of Internal Auditors Code of Ethics and International Standards, and guidance prepared by the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

EY is responsible for auditing ZIG's and the Group's financial statements and for auditing Zurich's compliance with specific regulatory requirements.\n\nIsabelle Santenac of EY is the global relationship partner and lead auditor. Thomas Fiepke, audit engagement partner, co-signs the auditors' report for 2022. Both of these partners took up office in 2021. Philip Kirkpatrick is the auditor in charge of the regulatory audit work. The Group together with EY ensures that the roles are rotated at least every five years.\n\nThe AGM elects the external auditors annually. The Board proposes to re-elect EY at ZIG's AGM on April 6, 2023 as external auditors for the financial year 2023. EY fulfills all necessary requirements under the Swiss Federal Act on the Admission and Oversight of Auditors and is admitted as a registered auditing company by the Federal Audit Oversight Authority.\n\n## Audit fees\n\nTotal audit fees (including expenses and value added taxes) charged by EY in the year 2022 amounted to USD 51.7 million.\n\nAudit fees are approved annually by the Audit Committee. Prior to the Audit Committee's approval, management reviews and validates EY's proposal, which is mainly based on an analysis of existing reporting units and expected changes to the legal and operational structure during the year.\n\nOnce the fees are agreed, they are further allocated to the countries and reporting units via a global allocation process with the allocations communicated to local CFOs and FAR controllers. As the year comes to a close, actual fees charged are reviewed and agreed with the local CFOs. At all levels - Group and local - there is a clear understanding of the basis for the current year fee, including the impacts of changes in scope or other factors. Unplanned overruns are reviewed and agreed with the business (responsible CFO or audit contact).\n\n## Non-audit fees\n\nTotal fees (including expenses and value added taxes) in the year 2022 for non-audit services, such as tax advice, audit-related services (primarily for service organization control reports, non-audit assurance engagements and actuarial regulatory reviews) and other services were USD 5.4 million.\n\nThe Audit Committee has approved a comprehensive policy for non-audit services, which defines allowable and non-allowable non-audit services as well as approval limits for non-audit service mandates at the local and Group level. Allowable non-audit services may include tax advice, comfort and consent letters as well as certifications and attestations, to the extent that such work complies with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and does not compromise the independence or objectivity of EY. To avoid conflicts of interest, all allowable non-audit services need pre-approval from the Audit Committee (Chairman), the Group CFO, the head of Group FAR or the local CFO, depending on the expected fee. The policy further requires, among other things, an engagement letter specifying the services to be provided.\n\nEY also tracks non-audit services and reports quarterly to the head of Group FAR and the Audit Committee the extent of non-audit services provided worldwide.\n\nThe audit and non-audit fees of EY for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31                   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total audit fees (including one-off IFRS 17/9 audit) |   51.7 |   39.3 |\n| Total non-audit fees  1                              |    5.4 |   16.8 |\n| - Tax advice                                         |    1.6 |    1.6 |\n| - Audit-related services                             |    3.1 |   12.9 |\n| - Other services                                     |    0.7 |    2.2 |\n\n- 1 Rounded individual amounts may not always add up to the rounded total.\n\n## Audit and non-audit fees",

During 2022, the Audit Committee met with EY seven times. The external auditors regularly have private sessions with the Audit Committee without management present. Based on written reports, the Audit Committee and the external auditors discuss the quality of the Group's financial and accounting function and any recommendations that they may have. Topics considered during such discussions include strengthening of internal financial controls, applicable accounting principles and management reporting systems. In connection with the audit, the Audit Committee obtains from the external auditors a timely report relating to the audited financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees external auditor's work. It reviews, at least annually, the external auditors' qualification, performance and independence and reviews any matters that may impair their objectivity and independence. The review is based on a written report by EY describing the firm's internal quality control procedures, any material issues raised and all relationships between EY and the Group and/or its employees that could be considered to bear on their independence. The Audit Committee evaluates the external auditors' performance during their audit examination. It elicits the comments of management regarding the auditors' performance (based on criteria such as their understanding of Zurich's business, technical knowledge and expertise, etc.) and the quality of the working relationship (responsiveness to the needs of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and the Group and the clarity of communication). The Audit Committee reviews, prior to the commencement of the annual audit, the scope and general extent of the external audit and suggests areas requiring special emphasis.\n\nThe Audit Committee proposes the external auditors to the Board for election by the AGM and is responsible for approving the audit fees (see page 71 for further information).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Guided by clear values and high standards of integrity in line with Zurich's code of conduct, Zurich's employees are using their expertise to create positive customer experiences, to simplify and to innovate.\n\nThe Group's incentive plans align remuneration awards with Zurich's relevant performance achievements, while also considering risk factors. The outcomes of the short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) are shown below. Among the financial and strategic highlights in 2022, relevant to the incentive plan awards, was a 12 percent increase in Group business operating profit (BOP) to USD 6.5 billion, compared to the prior year. The Group also reported net income attributable to shareholders' return on common shareholders' equity (NIAS ROE) in 2022 of 14.1 percent and an increase across the Group of 6.9 points in the customer net promoter system (NPS) score compared with the prior year.\n\nShort-term incentive plan (STIP)\n\n107%\n\nSTIP pool achievement level for the ExCo as a percentage of target for 2022 (2021: 105%) 1\n\n- 1   The STIP pool achievement level for the ExCo is based on the Group BOP achievement for 2022. For 2021, it was based on Group BOP and the overall customer net promoter system (NPS) score achievements. See page 80 for further details. The overall amount awarded across all STIP pools for all participants can be found on page 79.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Remuneration Committee would also like to acknowledge the lower level of support for the 2021 remuneration report at the AGM last year. Although the feedback we receive during our regular interactions with investors and other stakeholders is mostly supportive, some concerns were raised on the level of detail in our STIP disclosures.\n\nWe have been developing this disclosure over recent years, and following this latest feedback, we have incorporated further explanations on STIP in the remuneration report on pages 99-100 to provide more clarity on the STIP awards, including the performance achievements of the Group CEO. You can find more information on the actions we have taken in response to stakeholder feedback on pages 80-81.\n\nThe outcomes of the LTIP performance metrics, which we disclosed for the first time last year, provide transparency on the calculated vesting level for these awards.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, certain changes are being made to the metrics of the LTIP which align with the new targets communicated to investors in November 2022. These targets build on the success of the previous strategy cycles by raising the bar again. After careful consideration, we have also made the decision to introduce an environmental measure in the LTIP to support the delivery of our sustainability targets. Further details can be found in the outlook section on page 108.\n\nLong-term incentive plan (LTIP)\n\n155%\n\nVesting in 2023 as a percentage of target following the 2020-2022 performance period (2022: 200%)\n\nAt the AGM 2023, we invite you to express your views on our remuneration report 2022. More information on the remuneration votes, including the approvals on the maximum amounts of remuneration for the Board of Directors (Board) and for the Executive Committee (ExCo), can be found in the AGM invitation 2023 (www.zurich.com/investorrelations/shareholder-area/annual-generalmeeting). Details on the amounts previously approved compared with the amounts paid are provided in this report on page 96 for the Board and page 103 for the ExCo.\n\nWe appreciate your continued engagement, valuable exchanges, and your support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristoph Franz\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\nTotal variable remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmount of variable remuneration across the Group for 2022 (USD 885m) (2021: CHF 746m /USD 814m)\n\nCHF 818m",

The remuneration system is embedded in the Group's enterprise risk management framework and is designed to not encourage or reward inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nBoard members receive fixed remuneration as an annual fee, of which the basic fee is paid half in cash and half in five-year sales-restricted shares which are not subject to the achievement of any specific performance conditions. Total remuneration for employees, including members of the Executive Committee (ExCo), comprises fixed remuneration consisting of base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration including employee benefits, as well as variable remuneration consisting of short- and long-term incentive awards as applicable for an individual's role. The Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) aim to align the remuneration architecture with the achievement of the Group's key financial and strategic targets, the Group's enterprise risk management framework and operational plans, while considering the interests of key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more: Pages 83-89\n\n## Remuneration safeguards\n\nZurich's remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group's enterprise risk management framework and include, among others, the following safeguards:\n\n- - Emphasis on longer-term, deferred remuneration for the most senior positions and Group key risk-takers.\n- - Risk-based performance assessment for ExCo, leadership team and Group key risk-takers.\n- - Variable remuneration of employees in control and assurance functions is structured to avoid conflicts of interest by linking to Group metrics, rather than the metrics of the businesses they oversee.\n- - Ability to apply risk adjustments and exercise malus (all participants) and clawback (ExCo and some additional participants) for variable remuneration.\n- - Minimum share ownership requirements for the Board, Group CEO and other members of the ExCo.\n\nThe illustration below shows a greater emphasis on variable remuneration elements, with a higher weighting on average toward the long term, for our most senior employees.\n\n## 2022 remuneration structure 1 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 At target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n- 2  Considering ExCo members that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.",

The Farmers Exchanges are owned by their policyholders.\n- 2   Dividend at transaction day exchange rate in 2022 and 2021.\n- 3   The corresponding amount of total variable remuneration in Swiss francs is CHF 818m for 2022 and CHF 746m for 2021.\n\nAs can be seen from the metrics in the table, relative to Zurich's overall revenue and shareholders' equity, expenditure on variable remuneration remains relatively small.\n\nThe total variable remuneration for 54,640 employees across the Group in 2022, amounting to CHF 818 million, includes the following elements:\n\n- - The total expenditure on cash incentives to be paid for the performance year comprising the amount of the aggregated funding pools under the STIP, and the amounts to be paid under local short-term incentive plans.\n- - The value of share allocations, including target share allocations under the LTIP, made in 2022.\n- - The total amount of sign-on payments 1 committed in 2022, regardless of when the payments are due, for people taking up their employment in 2022.\n- - The total amount of severance payments 2 committed in 2022, regardless of when the payments are due.\n\nCommission payments made to employed sales agents are not included in the total variable remuneration amount.\n\nIn determining the amount of total variable remuneration, the Board considers the long-term economic performance of the Group as well as other relevant factors. The average economic profit is calculated by subtracting the required return on economic capital, based on the weighted average cost of capital, from the adjusted BOP (the amount before interest and variable remuneration) after tax. In this respect, the Group has continued to generate economic profit over the long term which exceeds the actual expenditure on variable pay.\n\n- 1 Zurich defines sign-on payments as payments (whether paid immediately or over time) that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract. Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n- 2  Zurich defines severance payments as payments that are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments however, that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\n## Key financial figures\n\n<!-- image -->",

For ExCo members, where only the Group BOP achievement determines the STIP pool achievement level as of 2022, more emphasis is placed on customer metrics in their individual goals as described on the following page. In addition, an overall qualitative assessment of business performance is carried out, including a risk-based review, which the Board takes into consideration when determining the funding.\n\nThe final STIP award for an individual is based on the business performance and resulting achievement level of the STIP pool they have been allocated to, as well as individual performance assessed against personal goals and behaviors in line with the Group's code of conduct and Zurich's purpose and values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on the Group's STIP:\n\nPages 85-87\n\nRead more on the STIP metrics and outcomes for the ExCo:\n\nPages 99-100\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nThe LTIP links remuneration with future performance and risk, thereby aligning participants with the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders and encouraging them to operate the business in a sustainable manner.

For Directors, the amount includes payments in cash and in sales-restricted shares.\n- 2   The cash incentives earned for the year for all employees comprise the amounts under the STIP and other local short-term incentive plans which are subject to approval by the applicable local boards. For all employees, payments such as sign-on and severance payments in cash are also included.\n- 3   Represents the value of target share allocations made in 2022, which will be assessed for vesting in 2025, and for all employees, also includes any other share allocations such as sign-on payments in shares.\n- 4   Actual, gross and for cash amounts based on the accrual principle.\n- 5   Includes the remuneration of ExCo members, as well as all other individuals employed by the Group and remunerated for work performed in respect of the Group.\n\n## Listening to stakeholder feedback\n\nThe Remuneration Committee aims to continuously review and improve the clarity of Zurich's remuneration disclosures as can be seen in the development of the remuneration report over the years. Last year, the remuneration report included enhancements focusing on clearer communication of the metrics used to determine variable pay awards for the ExCo. Further, regular dialogue with key stakeholders is undertaken to establish additional areas of improvement, along with a review of market practices and legal and regulatory requirements, as we continue to evolve our disclosures.\n\nSimilar to prior years and as part of the regular dialogue, the Chairman of the Board met investors representing approximately 46 percent of voting shares in 2022 (approximately 42 percent in 2021), as well as proxy advisors and consultants. Overall, the remuneration approach and practices were supported, and the disclosure improvements in the 2021 remuneration report were noted. There were however, some concerns about the level of detail in our STIP disclosures. Support for the consultative vote on the remuneration report subsequently fell for the second year running (AGM 2021: 78.1 percent support and AGM 2022: 73.9 percent support). To address this feedback, the Committee decided to make the following further adjustments for 2022:\n\n- -Enhanced disclosures can be found in the ExCo remuneration and shareholdings section of this report on pages 99-100. The explanation of variable remuneration amounts for the ExCo provides additional clarity on the STIP awards, including:\n- - The target set for the year and the resulting outcome of the business performance metric used to determine the STIP pool achievement level for the ExCo.\n- - The target card of the Group CEO as well as the performance achievements used to determine the individual performance outcome.\n- - The calculation of the STIP award and the resulting payout for the Group CEO.\n- - The STIP award as a percentage of target on an average basis for all ExCo members.\n- -Adaptions to the STIP metrics for the ExCo were agreed by the Board for 2022 and are shown on the next page. These changes better support the Group's strategy to focus on customers, simplify and innovate, and include:\n- -Increasing individual responsibility on customer focus by shifting customer metrics from the assessment of business performance used to determine the STIP pool achievement level, to an increased weight in the individual target card of each ExCo member. Customer metrics now represent a 40 percent weight in an ExCo member's target card, up from 15-20 percent previously, to ensure continued focus on customers, listening and acting on their feedback, as well as improving their overall experience. This shift of emphasis from the funding of STIP awards to the individual target cards of ExCo members supports the individual responsibility each member has to put customers at the heart of all we do.\n- -Considering overall execution against strategic priorities. Being able to adapt and innovate to execute strategic priorities, including delivering on responsibilities, sustainability and risk considerations, are all factors that help position Zurich for long-term success. A comprehensive review of overall contributions to strategic targets is therefore taken into account for each ExCo member's individual performance assessment. This minimizes the risks of unintended outcomes when focusing on a narrow set of metrics only, and allows adjustments, whether upward or downward, when justified. Group Risk Management, together with other control and assurance functions, continue to provide risk, compliance and audit information on each member that is considered in the overall assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich's remuneration philosophy is an integral part of our overall offer to employees and supports them in making a positive contribution to the success of the company. Based on established remuneration principles, the Group operates a balanced and effectively managed remuneration system providing competitive total remuneration opportunities to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees. The remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group's enterprise risk management framework and consider legal and regulatory requirements, as well as market developments.\n\n## Guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy\n\nThe guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy, aligned to Zurich's remuneration rules, are as follows:\n\n- - The remuneration architecture is simple, transparent, can be put into practice and considers the interests of key stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and employees.\n- - Reward decisions are made on the basis of merit - performance, skills, experience, qualifications and potential - and are free from discrimination toward or against particular diverse backgrounds. These principles ensure all employees have equal opportunities.\n- - The structure and level of total remuneration are aligned with the Group's risk policies and risk appetite.\n- - The elements of remuneration for each individual reflect appropriate internal and external factors and are tied to long-term results for individuals who have a material impact on the risk profile of the Group.\n- - A clearly defined performance and development approach guides employees throughout the year to achieve personal goals and exhibit behaviors in line with the Group's code of conduct, purpose and values, and this can be used to support remuneration decisions.\n- - Variable remuneration awards are linked to key performance factors which can include performance of the Group, countries, business units, functions, as well as individual achievements.\n- - The Group's STIP and LTIP, used for variable remuneration, are linked to appropriate performance criteria that are selected to support the execution of the Group's strategy. The overall expenditure on variable pay is considered in connection with the Group's long-term economic performance.\n- - The design of the LTIP links remuneration with the future development of performance and risk by including features for deferred remuneration, thereby encouraging participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner.\n- - Employees are provided with a range of benefits based on local market practices.\n\n## Equal pay for equivalent work\n\nAt Zurich we believe it is important for every employee to be treated in an inclusive and equal way. Methodology has been developed to consistently evaluate that gender is not a factor when it comes to pay for the same or similar roles across the Group. This methodology has been aligned with EDGE certification requirements and the analysis, or a similar approach, is carried out on an annual basis by several business units across the Group. In addition, business units may choose to review remuneration across additional parameters such as ethnicity, LGBT+, disability, or full and part-time work arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on our approach to pay equality:\n\nwww.zurich.com/en/careers/deib/equity\n\n## Elements of remuneration\n\n## Total remuneration\n\nTotal remuneration for an individual employee and its composition may be influenced by factors such as the scope and complexity of the role, level of responsibility, risk exposure, business performance and affordability, individual performance, professional experience, internal relativities, external competitiveness, geographic location and legal requirements. Remuneration is benchmarked toward median levels in clearly defined markets which can be local, regional or global, and reflects practices in either insurance, financial services or general industry, depending on the role and market.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overall benefit offerings are positioned around the relevant market median. The Group Pensions Committee provides oversight and a point of focus and coordination at Group level in relation to the long-term financial and reputational risks relating to the Group's pension arrangements. Almost all new employees are offered defined contribution or cash balance type arrangements.\n\nThe Group also provides a range of other relevant employee benefits in line with the local market, for example life insurance, medical coverage and flexible benefits, and may also include distinctive Zurich components. Further, the Group operates several mobility-related policies to facilitate the movement of people across the organization.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nIncentive plans are designed to provide a range of award opportunities linked to levels of performance. Business and individual performance may result in remuneration levels above target for superior performance, and reduced levels that are below target for performance below expectations. Variable remuneration opportunities are provided to motivate employees to achieve key short-term and long-term business goals that support the execution of the Group's strategy. Further information on the Group's STIP and LTIP is set out below.\n\n## Short-term incentives\n\n## Short-term (one-year) incentives are performance-driven based on the following design for 2022:\n\nShort-term cash incentives support employees to focus their performance on the achievement of key financial, customer and individual goals set at the beginning of the year. They are delivered primarily through the Group's STIP, which is utilized across the organization and in many countries covers all employees. In some countries, based on market practice in that location, only the most senior individuals participate. Determination of the final individual STIP award for the year ending December 31, 2022, is based on an individual's STIP target amount, the performance of the business in line with the pool to which an individual has been allocated, and an individual's personal achievements in terms of goals and behaviors as set out in the overview on the next page. For employees below a certain job level, markets also have the option to base the award solely on an individual's STIP target amount and the achievement level of the relevant pool, provided a minimum standard of individual performance and expected behaviors has been demonstrated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The award is capped at 200 percent of the STIP target, irrespective of the STIP pool achievement level and individual performance award level.\n\nThe resulting STIP award is paid in cash.\n\nx\n\nx\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## STIP pool achievement\n\nPerformance on business-relevant profitability and customer metrics 1 , including a qualitative assessment of the performance, determines the STIP pool achievement level and the respective funding or allowable spend available for each STIP pool. This can vary between 0 and 175 percent of the target amount.\n\nKey metrics for the STIP pools:\n\n- -  ExCo: Group BOP\n- -  Other Group pools 2 : Group BOP and the overall customer NPS\n- -  Investment Management: Investment results\n- -  Countries: Relevant BOP and customer NPS as applicable\n- - Farmers 3 : Growth, profitability and customer metrics\n- -  Joint ventures: Relevant profitability metrics\n- 1 The Net Promoter System (NPS) score is a global best practice standard for measuring customer experience and one of the key measures (20 percent weight) used to determine the business performance in markets where there is sufficiently robust data. Over 90 percent of STIP participants are in a pool where funding is impacted by customer satisfaction achievements.\n- 2  Other Group pools include the wider leadership team, employees in control functions, and employees in Group and regional roles.\n- 3  Includes a separate pool for Farmers New World Life.",

In addition to the actual business performance achieved versus plan, the Board considers factors such as the quality of earnings, unusual or one-off items affecting results, market conditions, performance relative to peers, as well as a review of risk considerations and input from other assurance functions, provided by the Group Chief Risk Officer. The qualitative assessment ensures that award levels are consistent with the guiding principles of Zurich's remuneration philosophy, including supporting the execution of the Group's strategy, considering the interests of key stakeholders and alignment with risk policies.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\n## Long-term (three- to six-year) incentives are performance-driven based on the following design for the performance period 2022 to 2024:\n\nTo support the achievement of the Group's longer-term goals, long-term incentives are utilized for a defined group of the most senior positions in Zurich, those that have a significant influence on the risk profile of the Group, as well as individuals considered suitable for participation, for example, due to market competitiveness given their skills and areas of expertise. This group generally includes the individuals with the highest levels of total remuneration. The LTIP aligns the incentives and behaviors of participants with the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders. To further support this purpose, the individual hedging of any shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd is prohibited.\n\nIn alignment with the Group's risk profile and business strategy, and considering best practice principles among insurance companies, as well as views from proxy advisers and shareholders, long-term incentives are provided with a deferral element that takes into account material risks and their time horizon. Such deferred remuneration is structured to promote the risk awareness of participants and to encourage participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner. An overview of the LTIP for the performance period 2022-2024 is set out on the following page.\n\nDetails of the LTIP relevant for the 2023 vesting decision following the performance period from 2020-2022 can be found in the remuneration report for 2020 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/results-and-reports) and the performance outcomes are detailed in the remuneration and shareholdings section of this report on page 101.\n\nDetails of the LTIP for the next performance period beginning in 2023, can be found in the outlook section on page 108.",

An adjustment of +/-25 percentage points to the calculated vesting level may be applied. No discretionary adjustment was made to the calculated vesting level for 2023 following the 2020-2022 performance period.\n\nThe right to modify awards to reflect individual circumstances is reserved for the Group CEO, except for modifications regarding members of the ExCo where this right is reserved for the Board based on recommendation by the Remuneration Committee. An adjustment of +/-25 percentage points to the calculated final vesting level may be applied on an individual basis prior to vesting. However, if performance under exceptional or unusual circumstances warrants it, exceptions to the +/-25 percentage points adjustment may be made. In this respect, Zurich reserves the right to adjust and even set the vesting level to 0 percent for an individual to reflect specific circumstances (e.g., in connection with a breach of internal or external rules) during the period prior to vesting. Any such adjustment is reserved exclusively for the Board based on recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Clawback and malus conditions for variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration is subject to clawback provisions for members of the ExCo and also for additional participants in some jurisdictions as required by local laws and regulations, to allow for the recovery or forfeiture of awards. Malus conditions to reduce or eliminate awards are applicable to all STIP and LTIP participants. Clawback or malus conditions may apply for example, in cases of misconduct, violation of the Group's code of conduct or applicable laws, or where there has been a material financial restatement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details on the votes can be found in the AGM invitation 2023 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/shareholder-area/ annual-general-meeting) and in the respective sections of the remuneration report for the Board (page 96) and for the ExCo (page 103). Art. 18, 28, 32 and 34 of the articles of association outline the approach regarding the votes on pay, supplementary amounts for any new members of the ExCo during a period for which the remuneration for the ExCo has already been approved, performance-related remuneration for the ExCo, allocation of shares, contracts with Board and ExCo members, and loans and credits.\n\n## Remuneration and risk\n\nThe Remuneration and the Risk and Investment Committees meet jointly once a year to discuss a risk review of the remuneration architecture and the remuneration governance framework. The assessment of risk in making reward decisions, and the ability to apply risk adjustments and exercise malus and clawback, if required, are features of Zurich's remuneration framework. Group Risk Management evaluated the remuneration architecture in 2022 and reported that the remuneration architecture does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking that exceeds the Group's risk appetite and tolerance.\n\nTo help align remuneration with the Group's risk appetite and tolerance, Group Risk Management consults with other control, governance and assurance functions to provide the Group CEO with a review of risk factors to consider when assessing overall performance for the annual funding of incentive awards. The Group CEO considers Group Risk Management's assessment, amongst other factors, when proposing the funding for the STIP pools to the Remuneration Committee, which in turn makes its recommendation to the Board for final approval. The Group Chief Risk Officer is available to discuss these findings with the Remuneration Committee and the Board.\n\nAll Group leadership team roles, which includes ExCo roles, are considered key risk-taker positions. The remuneration for key risk-taker positions includes STIP and LTIP, with a greater emphasis toward long-term incentives and therefore, deferred remuneration. Group Risk Management, together with other control and assurance functions, provide risk, compliance, and audit information about each key risk-taker as part of the annual individual performance assessment of the leadership team, including the ExCo. This is considered when assessing performance and making reward decisions.\n\nThe variable remuneration of employees in control and assurance functions is structured to avoid conflicts of interest by linking to Group profitability metrics rather than the profitability of the business controlled by such functions.\n\nAt reasonable intervals, Group Audit assesses the operational implementation of Zurich's remuneration rules to verify that the remuneration architecture is adhered to across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

ExCo members achieve this through their participation in the LTIP and market purchases. Directors, the Group CEO and other ExCo members have a period of five years to meet their ownership requirements and the Remuneration Committee monitors compliance with these guidelines annually.\n\nAt the end of 2022, all Directors and all ExCo members who have served at least five years on the Board or the ExCo, respectively, met the required share ownership level.\n\n## Share dilution\n\nZurich did not issue any new shares in 2022 or 2021.\n\n|                |                                            | 2022        | 2021        |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Share dilution | Shares issued during the year  1           | -           | -           |\n|                | Registered shares as of December 31        | 150,460,167 | 150,460,167 |\n| LTIP           | Total number of unvested target shares  2  | 1,386,835   | 1,651,886   |\n| LTIP           | - as a percentage of the registered shares | 0.92%       | 1.10%       |\n\n- 1 During 2021 and 2022, share-based compensation awards were funded with own shares repurchased on the market.\n- 2   Given the vesting level of 155 percent of target for the share allocations vesting in 2023 and assuming 100 percent vesting in 2024 and 2025.

In addition, the information according to art. 663c of the Swiss Code of Obligations is being audited and disclosed as such in the remuneration report. All audited sections have been highlighted accordingly.\n\nThe following section sets out the remuneration and shareholdings of members of the Board of Directors and members of the ExCo, as well as the remuneration of all employees.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n## Directors' fees\n\nAs Zurich is a global insurance provider, its Directors' fees need to be established at a level which enables the Group to attract and retain individuals with a long-term interest in Zurich's success and reflecting the diversity of the Group's employee and customer base. To assist in determining Board remuneration, an independent adviser carries out benchmarking studies on a regular basis. Zurich aims to set the remuneration of its Directors at the relevant median levels using the Swiss Market Index (SMI) as a basis. Based on the role and the fee structure set out in the table below, fee levels are established for each member of the Board. Fees are paid in cash and shares, with half of the basic fee provided in five-year sales-restricted shares. The fees paid to Directors (including the portion provided in sales-restricted shares) are not subject to the achievement of any specific performance conditions.\n\nAll Board members of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd are also Board members of Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, and the fees cover duties and responsibilities under both boards.\n\n|                                                                            | Fee elements   in cash   (CHF 000)   | Fee elements   in sales-  restricted   shares   (CHF 000)   | Total fees   2022 (CHF 000)   | Total fees   2021 (CHF 000)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Basic fee for the Chairman of the Board  2                                 | 1,000                                | 1,000                                                       | 2,000                         | 2,000                         |\n| Basic fee for the Vice-Chairman of the Board  2                            | 225                                  | 225                                                         | 450                           | 450                           |\n| Basic fee for a member of the Board                                        | 120                                  | 120                                                         | 240                           | 240                           |\n| Committee fee  3                                                           | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                            | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Audit Committee                                          | 100                                  | -                                                           | 100                           | 100                           |\n| Chair fee for the Remuneration Committee  4                                | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                            | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Risk and Investment Committee                            | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                            | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Governance, Nominations and  Sustainability Committee  4 | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                            | 80                            |\n\n- 1 These amounts are for the period from AGM to AGM.

In 2022, the Board consisted entirely of non-executive Directors independent from management.\n\nWhere a Director is also a member of one or more subsidiary boards of Zurich, the Director is entitled to an additional fee of CHF 50,000 per annum, plus CHF 10,000 per annum if he or she also chairs an audit committee of such a board. The fee structure for subsidiary boards can be modified if certain circumstances, for example, the additional time commitment to discharge the duties of a board member, warrant it. None of the Board members had an additional mandate in a subsidiary board of Zurich in 2022 or 2021.\n\nThe following tables set out the actual fees paid to the Directors for 2022 and 2021 in Swiss francs. In 2022, 11 members served for the full year and one member served for part of the year. In 2021, 10 members served for the full year and two members served for part of the year. The total aggregate fees for the calendar year 2022 amounted to CHF 5,620,000, which is higher compared with the corresponding amount of CHF 5,510,000 for 2021, due to the increase in the number of Board members in 2022.\n\n## Audited\n\n| Directors' fees   | in CHF                     | 2022  1              | 2022  1              | 2022  1              | 2022  1   | 2022  1                       | 2022  1   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| 2022              |                            | Fee elements in cash | Fee elements in cash | Fee elements in cash |           | Basic fee                     |           |\n|                   |                            | Basic                | Committee            | Chair                | Total     | in sales-  restricted   4,  5 | Total     |\n|                   |                            | fee                  | fee  2               | fee  3               | cash      | shares                        | fees      |\n|                   | M.

To assist with decisions regarding the remuneration structure and the mix of the individual remuneration elements for ExCo members, the Board conducts benchmarking studies on a regular basis, taking into account relevant market practices within peer groups, as well as internal relativities.\n\nThe remuneration structures and practices of a core peer group, consisting of the following insurance and reinsurance firms in the Dow Jones Insurance Titans 30 Index, are analyzed:\n\nAIG, Allianz, Allstate, Aviva, AXA, Chubb, Generali, Legal & General, Manulife Financial Corp., MetLife, Munich Re, Progressive Ohio, Prudential Plc, QBE, Swiss Re, The Hartford and Travelers Cos. Inc.\n\nThe core peer group is regularly reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. Further, the analysis is supplemented by additional benchmarking studies as appropriate, for example, reviewing practices of large SMI companies in Switzerland or companies of a similar size in other countries.\n\nThe distribution of the individual elements making up the total remuneration of the ExCo in 2022 is set out in the following chart and is based on the target values for performance-related remuneration. It shows an appropriate balance of remuneration elements, with a significant emphasis on performance-related remuneration (STIP and LTIP), particularly long-term, deferred remuneration.\n\n## 2022 remuneration structure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 At target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n- 2  Considering ExCo members that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The values of any one-off remuneration awards, such as replacement payments, and the amounts of contractually agreed remuneration after stepping down from the ExCo and during the notice period, are shown below the total amounts. Total remuneration for the ExCo in 2022 increased compared with the prior year. There was no change to the overall remuneration structure for the ExCo in 2022, however an increase in other remuneration compared with the prior year considers costs relating to expatriates which may fluctuate year to year. The amount of short-term incentives compared with the prior year reflects performance outcomes against the targets set for 2022.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31                    | in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31                    | Highest-paid individual  (Group CEO)   | Highest-paid individual  (Group CEO)   |             |             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                     |                                                                     | 2022  1                                | 2021  1                                | 2022  1,  2 | 2021  1 , 3 |\n| Fixed                                                               | Base salaries                                                       | 1.7                                    | 1.7                                    | 11.3        | 11.0        |\n| remuneration                                                        | Pension benefits  4                                                 | 0.4                                    | 0.4                                    | 3.4         | 3.4         |\n|                                                                     | Other remuneration  5                                               | 0.1                                    | 0.1                                    | 5.3         | 0.4         |\n| Variable                                                            | Short-term incentives                                               | 3.4                                    | 3.2                                    | 16.6        | 15.8        |\n| remuneration                                                        | Long-term incentives                                                | 3.8                                    | 3.8                                    | 19.1        | 17.1        |\n| Total in CHF  6                                                     |                                                                     | 9.4                                    | 9.2                                    | 55.7        | 47.7        |\n| Total in USD  6,  7                                                 | Total in USD  6,  7                                                 | 10.1                                   | 10.1                                   | 59.6        | 51.8        |\n| in CHF million, for the years ended December 31                     | in CHF million, for the years ended December 31                     | 2022  8                                | 2021  8                                | 2022  2,  8 | 2021  3 , 8 |\n| Other payments and share allocations  9                             | Other payments and share allocations  9                             | -                                      | -                                      | 0.6         | -           |\n| Contractual remuneration after stepping down until termination  1 0 | Contractual remuneration after stepping down until termination  1 0 | -                                      | -                                      | -           | 2.8         |\n\n- 1 The remuneration shown is gross, based on the accrual principle, for the time employees are members of the ExCo during the year and does not include any business-related expenses incurred in the performance of the members' services.\n- 2   On the basis of 12 members of the ExCo, of whom 11 served in the ExCo during the full year in 2022.

Benefits-in-kind have been valued using market rates.\n- 6   Zurich also paid the company-related portion of contributions to social security systems for members and former members of the ExCo in line with applicable laws where the executives are employed, which amounted to CHF 4.2 million in 2022 and CHF 3.8 million in 2021. Since the contributions are based on full earnings, whereas benefits are capped, there is no direct correlation between the costs paid to social security systems and the benefits received by the executives.\n- 7 The amounts have been translated from CHF to USD at the relevant exchange rates throughout the year and the cash incentive to be paid in 2023 has been translated at the year-end rate in 2022.\n- 8   The remuneration shown is gross, based on the accrual principle and does not include any business-related expenses incurred in the performance of the members' or former members' services.\n- 9   These are extraordinary and include payments and share allocations to compensate incentive plan forfeitures with previous employers.\n- 10  Relates to contractually agreed remuneration for leavers for the period of employment in 2022 or 2021 as applicable, after stepping down from the ExCo and during the notice period. Such remuneration may include base salaries, cash incentives, LTIP target allocations, pension costs and other remuneration including employee benefits, on a pro rata basis. Severance payments are not paid to ExCo members.\n\nBased on these figures, total ExCo remuneration consists of 36 percent in fixed remuneration, comprising base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration including employee benefits, as well as 64 percent in performance-related remuneration, comprising short-term and long-term incentives (31 percent and 69 percent, respectively, in 2021).\n\n## Audited\n\nRemuneration of the highest-paid individual and all ExCo members (including the highest-paid)\n\n<!-- image -->",

At year-end, following an assessment of each individual's performance, a performance category is assigned with differentiated award levels. To assess individual performance, each member first conducts a self-assessment. Group Risk Management, together with other control and assurance functions, provide risk, compliance and audit information on each member. A discussion is then held between each member of the ExCo and the Group CEO. In a rigorous process, the Group CEO and the Remuneration Committee review the individual performance achievements, including risk and behavior aspects. The Group CEO's performance is assessed by the Remuneration Committee and includes a review of the targets set at the beginning of the year, as well as progress on delivering the strategic plan, with risk and sustainability aspects as key considerations. The Group CEO is not present during these discussions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The corresponding total number of PSUs allocated for the three-year performance period 2022-2024, was 42,236. The PSUs are valued using the closing share price of CHF 451.20 on the day prior to the allocation (second working day in April), and will be assessed for vesting in 2025 based on the metrics and targets outlined in the vesting grid on page 88. DEUs may accrue during the vesting period.\n\nThe LTIP targets for the allocation in 2022 varied between 125 percent and 225 percent of base salary for ExCo members and the maximum vesting level is 200 percent of the aggregate number of target shares (PSUs and DEUs).\n\nThe LTIP vesting level in 2023 for target shares allocated in 2020 is 155 percent. No discretionary adjustment was made to the calculated vesting level as outlined below.\n\n## LTIP vesting level 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Vesting grid for 2019 - 2021 applies.\n\n## Replacement payments\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances where payments are made to new hires to replace forfeitures under the incentive plans of the previous employer, the payments tend to mirror the type and timing of the forfeited payments and can include cash payments and/or awards of restricted share units (RSUs) or PSUs. Where payments are made in cash, there is typically a clawback period if the employee leaves the company voluntarily during the first two years of employment. RSUs typically vest over three to five years following the date of allocation and are also credited with DEUs during the vesting period to compensate for any dividend paid. RSUs and associated DEUs are typically forfeited if the holder of such allocations leaves the company before the vesting date and the employment relationship terminates.\n\nIn 2022, replacement payments made to a new ExCo member who took up employment with the Group during the year, comprised cash payments made in 2022 and to be made in 2023, as well as RSUs vesting in 2023 and 2024. No replacement payments were made in 2021.\n\n| Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   | Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   | Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   | Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   | Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   | Vesting grid for the performance period 2020-2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 0% vesting                                          | 50% vesting                                         | 100% vesting                                        | 150% vesting                                        | 200% vesting                                        |                                                     |\n| 18 th  - 13 th                                      | 12 th  - 10 th                                      | 9 th  - 7 th                                        | 6 th  - 4 th                                        | 3 rd  - 1 st                                        |                                                     |\n| <11.75% p.a.                                        | 11.75% p.a.                                         | 14.00% p.a.                                         | 15.125% p.a.                                        | \u226516.25% p.a.                                        |                                                     |\n| <USD 10.5bn USD 10.5bn                              |                                                     | USD 11.5bn                                          | USD 12.0bn                                          | \u2265USD 12.5bn                                         |                                                     |\n|                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     | 191%                                                |\n|                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     | 200%                                                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

LTIP amounts do not consider shareholder returns including dividend equivalents from the date of the target share allocation until the date of vesting, as well as the impact of share price and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Zurich also pays the company-related portion of contributions to social security in line with applicable law. These contributions are not included in the amounts, however as a reference, Zurich paid an amount of CHF 4.2 million for the calendar year 2022.\n- 2  Based on art. 18 para. 4 of the articles of association (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association), Zurich is authorized to make payments to any member who joins the ExCo during a period for which the AGM has already approved the remuneration of the ExCo, of a supplementary amount for the period(s) in question, where the total amount already approved for such remuneration is not sufficient. The sum of all supplementary amounts may not exceed, during any one remuneration period, 30 percent of the respective total amount of approved maximum total remuneration for the ExCo.\n\nInformation on the proposed maximum total amount of remuneration for the ExCo for 2024 can be found in the AGM invitation 2023 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/shareholder-area/annual-general-meeting).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The benchmarking analysis is mainly carried out and approved at a local level. The Group had 59,498 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2022 (54,914 in 2021).\n\nThe following section includes information regarding the total remuneration earned by employees for 2022 and 2021 across the Group, including remuneration for ExCo members. The amount of cash incentive awards includes, among others, the awards across all pools in the Group's short-term incentive plan. The performance achievements against the predefined metrics for the STIP pools resulted in an overall funding level of 108 percent of the target amount for 2022 across the Group.

The amount included in this figure for defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial factors and can vary year-on-year as economic conditions change. These numbers are explained in greater detail in note 20 of the consolidated financial statements.

Differences in value between the initial estimated amount expensed in the income statement for the LTIP and the actual shares vesting in 2023, are reflected in the 2022 consolidated income statement in line with accounting principles. For the 2020 plan with shares vesting in 2023, there was an increase of USD 30 million in the expense recognized in the 2022 income statement to reflect actual performance to date compared with original estimates. In 2021, there was an increase of USD 81 million to the expense recognized in the income statement to reflect adjustments due to actual performance for the 2019 and 2020 plans.\n\n## Sign-on and severance payments for key risk-takers\n\nThe following definition and principles for sign-on and severance payments apply:\n\n- -Sign-on payments are payments that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract (whether paid immediately or over time). Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo. Any replacement payments for members of the ExCo, including the Group CEO, must be approved by the Board based on a proposal by the Remuneration Committee.\n- -Severance payments are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments, however, that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\nThe Group as a principle does not make any sign-on or severance payments, however, if circumstances which in the Group's interest warrant such payments, these can be approved through a clear governance process. Any such payment with a value of CHF 1 million or more is approved by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee prior to the time the employment offer is made or prior to the time the severance payment is committed to.\n\nThe following table discloses sign-on and severance payments committed to key risk-takers. Key risk-takers are incumbents of Zurich's most senior positions, as well as positions that have a significant influence on the risk profile of Zurich. All Group leadership team roles, which includes ExCo roles, are considered key risk-taker positions. For key risk-taker roles where the incumbent is a member of the ExCo, no payments in advance and/or severance payments have been made. Replacement payments for the ExCo in 2022 and 2021 are included where such payments were made.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2022            | 2022                      | 2021 Number of   | 2021 Number of   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                    | Amount  (CHF m) | Number of   beneficiaries | Amount  (CHF m)  | beneficiaries    |\n| Sign-on payments/number of beneficiaries           | 2.2             | 3                         | 2.0              | 5                |\n| Severance payments/number of beneficiaries         | 3.9             | 2                         | -                | -                |\n\nSign-on and severance payments for key risk-takers\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2022, particular attention was given to reviewing the metrics in the incentive plans to:\n\n- - Ensure alignment with the next strategic cycle from 2023-2025.\n- - Explore additional metrics that support the Group's sustainability targets.\n- - Understand the impact of the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting changes on the financial targets in the LTIP.\n\nThese reviews resulted in a proposal to the Board on the following changes to the Group's LTIP which the Board approved as of the next strategy cycle beginning in 2023:\n\n- -Business operating profit after tax return on equity (BOPAT ROE) to replace NIAS ROE in the LTIP vesting grid as of 2023: One of the financial targets for the next strategy cycle is a BOPAT ROE in excess of 20 percent. The Board decided that incorporating this in the LTIP would further align variable remuneration with the new strategic financial targets. In addition, with IFRS 9 effective from 2023, there is an increase in volatility to the NIAS ROE as there are more cases in which market-driven changes in fair value will be recognized in profit or loss. Replacing the NIAS ROE metric with BOPAT ROE limits the impact of capital gains and losses that are outside of management control on Group targets, which is more consistent with the Group's risk policies.\n- -Introducing Zurich's operational CO2e emissions reduction target 1 in the LTIP vesting grid for the 2023-2025 performance period: Operational emissions have been reported at Zurich since 2008. The reporting methodology for this metric is therefore considered one of the more mature externally reported ESG metrics of the Group and this is also reinforced by receiving reasonable assurance 2 on the 2021 data. As part of our sustainability journey, this metric will be introduced into the LTIP for the 2023-2025 performance period with a 10 percent weight as seen in the vesting grid below. The target to be achieved by the end of 2025 is 65,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions .\n- -LTIP metric targets reflect the new financial targets for 2023-2025: The vesting grid for allocations made as of 2023 also reflects the new financial targets communicated to investors in November 2022 and is shown below.\n\n## LTIP vesting grid for the 2023-2025 performance period, vesting in 2026:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                          | Performance  criteria                                             | Weight   | 0%  vesting          | 50%  vesting th   | 100%  vesting 7 th  - 9 th   | 150%  vesting 4 th  - 6 th   | 200%  vesting 1 st  - 3 rd   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Vesting grid for the new strategic cycle | Relative TSR position  (no change)                                | 30% 30%  | 13 th  - 18 th < 15% | 10 th  - 12 15%   |                              | 21%                          | \u2265 22%                        |\n| Vesting grid for the new strategic cycle | Average BOPAT ROE  (replaces NIAS ROE) Cumulative cash remittance | 30%      | p.a.  < USD  11.5bn  | p.a.

The performance expectations for the metrics in these plans will not change, however financial targets may need to be realigned to the new standard and any adjustments will be shared in the 2023 remuneration report.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will continue to review the Group's remuneration architecture and framework ensuring it supports the execution of the strategy, complies with legal and regulatory requirements and aligns with risk considerations. In addition, the Committee will keep monitoring regulatory and other external developments, as well as engaging in dialogue with investors, proxy advisers and other stakeholders.\n\nShareholders are invited to express their opinion on the remuneration report 2022 through an advisory vote at the AGM 2023. They also have the opportunity to approve the maximum total amount of remuneration for the Board for the one-year period from the AGM 2023-AGM 2024 and for the ExCo for the financial year 2024, in the binding votes. More information on these votes can be found in the AGM invitation 2023 (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/ shareholder-area/annual-general-meeting) and in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n- 1 CO2e includes carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide equivalent of other greenhouse gases, most commonly methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). The emissions reduction target is based on approximately 90 percent of CO2e emissions from Zurich's operations within the control boundary as specified in footnote 1 to table 14 on page 169 of the integrated sustainability disclosure. Approximately 10 percent has been excluded from the calculation methodology used for LTIP due to time lags in the availability of data that do not align with the timing for the assessment of the LTIP vesting level at the end of the performance period. This considers facilities and data center emissions, both of which have been minimized through the use of renewable power in 2022 onwards.\n- 2  The assurance statement can be found under www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/net-zero-in-operations.",

The audit was limited to the information on remuneration, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies Limited by Shares (Verordnung gegen \u00fcberm\u00e4ssige Verg\u00fctungen bei b\u00f6rsenkotierten Aktiengesellschaften, Veg\u00fcV) in the tables labeled 'audited' of the Remuneration Report.\n\nIn our opinion, the information on remuneration, loans and advances in the attached Remuneration Report complies with Swiss law and Art. 14-16 Veg\u00fcV.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \u00abAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Remuneration Report\u00bb section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the Remuneration Report, the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Remuneration Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhone:\n\n+41 58 286 86 86\n\nFax:\n\n+41 58 286 30 04\n\nwww.ey.com/ch\n\nZurich, February 8, 2023",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of directors' responsibilities for the Remuneration Report\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the preparation of a Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Remuneration Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The board of directors is also responsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual remuneration packages.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Remuneration Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information on remuneration, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 Veg\u00fcV is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Remuneration Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf084 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Remuneration Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf084 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \uf084 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n\nWe communicate with the board of directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For instance, through our Zurich Forest Project, we are helping to restore a unique and biodiverse ecosystem in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.\n\nWe also want to do what we can to help decarbonize our economies. That's why we committed to reduce the carbon intensity of our underwriting and investment portfolios to net-zero by 2050.\n\nBut our ambitions run much deeper. We aspire to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world.\n\nThis change begins with us: with doing the right thing by our planet, our customers and our employees.\n\n## Updated sustainability goals\n\nWe have come a long way since we set out to create a sustainability plan in 2018 to guide us in building a resilient organization.

It is one of the reasons why independent studies rate us a leader among global peers on climate risk mitigation initiatives.\n\n## Customer\n\nOur focus is always on helping and inspiring our customers to join us on our journey to net-zero. We believe it is better to engage with our customers and investee companies to check that they have viable credible transition plans rather than simply divest or end a relationship.\n\nWe also offer products and services to enable sustainable choices and outcomes. Examples include the take up of electric vehicles, the development of renewable energy and investment in responsible funds.\n\n## Sustainability highlights 2022\n\n## USD 566m\n\nrevenues from sustainable solutions 1\n\n-12%\n\nreduced intensity in financed corporate CO2e emissions 2\n\n## 3.2m\n\nmetric tons CO2e avoided through climate-related impact investments 3\n\n- 1 Based on our internal definition.\n- 2  Compared to our 2019 baseline.\n- 3  Impact number include methodology upgrade, as explained in Zurich's impact measurement methodology paper www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/zurich-impactmeasurement-framework.pdf\n- 4  Compared to our 2019 basline.

We listen and adapt to emerging and evolving needs, whether that's through developing accident insurance for the gig economy or our data commitment to reassure customers that we will never sell their personal data.\n\n## Employees\n\nFinally, as a global employer, we are constantly striving to foster a culture of inclusiveness in our workplace. We also focus on building a caring environment that enables our people to improve their physical, mental, emotional and financial wellbeing.\n\nThrough our focus on work sustainability we are building a learning organization that helps our employees to grow their talents.\n\n## The need for transparency and accountability\n\nSupporting our customers and society at large to build resilience against some of the most challenging environmental and social risks is at the heart of our purpose to create a brighter future together. These ambitions, however, are meaningless if we cannot measure the impact of our work. We must match ambition with appropriate ways to gauge our progress, champion transparency and hold ourselves, our industry and stakeholders to account.\n\nIn this second year of publishing the integrated sustainability disclosure (ISD), we are providing greater transparency on how we are measuring progress toward our sustainability goals.\n\nAs an advocate, adviser and role model, we want to support individuals and organizations to thrive today and flourish tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alison Martin\n\nCEO EMEA (Europe, Middle East & Africa) and Bank Distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal hire ratio of\n\n71%\n\n## USD 8.8bn\n\ntax contribution 7\n\n72%\n\nof our procurement spend 8 is in compliance to our supplier code of conduct\n\nUSD 41.5m\n\ndonated via the Z Zurich Foundation 9\n\n- 6  Senior management represents the combination of career levels D and E.\n- 7 Tax contribution comprises the tax borne by shareholders in 2021 and taxes collected in 2021.\n- 8  The spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function according to the 2020 baseline on goods and services that are required to enable Zurich to maintain and develop its operations, excluding suppliers no longer active in 2022.\n- 9  The Z Zurich Foundation is a Swiss-based charitable foundation established by members of the Group.

Independent assurance report\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs an insurer, a key component of our Group 1 success is the trust built through doing the right things, in the right way, and measuring and reporting the effects of those actions. In this light, we continue to embed sustainability across our business through accountable, transparent, measurable initiatives. We strongly believe in the need to disclose clear, comprehensive, and high-quality information on our performance against key sustainability indicators, covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## At Zurich, sustainability is integral to how we conduct business and measure success.\n\n## George Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobally recognized and generally accepted reporting principles on sustainability don't exist yet, however industry alliances and standard setters are taking positive action to address this gap. The insurance industry has moved further in taking concrete actions to support the efforts against climate change. As a founding member of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), we worked intensively with other members to deliver the target-setting protocol (TSP) issued in January 2023. The TSP sets out the minimum requirements for all members to set their initial interim targets. It allows NZIA member organizations to individually set science-based targets for their underwriting portfolios in line with a 1.5\u00b0C, net-zero transition pathway.\n\nWhile actively contributing to these initiatives, we have progressed further in leveraging our expertise in financial accounting and reporting to establish our sustainability measurement and reporting processes. Globally, sustainability has become a standard agenda topic for finance and its leaders. We all have an important role in making sustainability disclosures transparent and comparable.\n\n## About this report\n\nWe have endeavored to create a meaningful disclosure based on good practices, sustainability regulations and external reporting frameworks. Accordingly, this report has adopted a combination of existing frameworks to provide insights into the most material topics for our business and our key stakeholders. In addition, this report includes reporting on our targets under the three pillars of our sustainability framework 2 and the indicators we use to measure progress on them.\n\n## Frameworks followed\n\nWe continue to disclose in line with the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which allows us to understand the resilience of our strategy to climate risks. It also provides insights into the sustainability risks and opportunities our business faces. Read more about it in the planet section (pages 131 to 169). Additionally, we have considered the 21 core World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standard for the insurance industry. We follow a 'disclose or explain' approach as in prior years. All the indicators material to us are included directly in the integrated sustainability disclosure (ISD), and we address less material indicators in the index table.\n\n## Climate risk assessment\n\nWe perform our scenario-based climate risk assessment with three focus areas - underwriting and investment portfolios as well as our own operations. The heatmap of our underwriting portfolio remains unchanged compared to 2021, as the business mix did not change significantly in 2022. We monitor this closely and have prioritized strategic actions in our underwriting portfolio. On the investment side, we have extended the scope of the scenario analysis to additional asset classes, covering a bigger portion of the balance sheet. In our own operations, we reviewed further risks, including the impact of climate change on our distributed workforce and supply chain. The outcomes of these analyses are used to determine appropriate responses and confirm the resilience of our strategy.\n\n## Other enhancements in ISD 2022\n\nWe have included several new KPIs or extended the scope of previously disclosed KPIs. The financed emissions are now split between equities and corporate bonds and our engagement actions with our top 10 emitters without science-based targets, are now shown by sector and region providing additional transparency. We have provided the coverage ratio and new targets for green-certified buildings in our real estate portfolio. Disclosure of monetary losses arising from natural catastrophes has been extended to include net losses by type of event and region. Our customer-related KPIs have been extended to include additional countries. We now show the absolute customer retention rate aligning with the SASB framework. On social matters, a human rights risk assessment was performed on our supply chain which has been included. Training related KPIs on data security have been added.\n\nWe have set ourselves ambitious targets and have taken clear positions on several issues (see section 2.2, pages 119 to 120) and remain focussed on being one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world.\n\nNote: The indicators included in this report cover the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022, unless stated otherwise. Some data may be collected and reported as at an earlier date in the year. Certain cases are extrapolated for the remaining months of the year based on the Group's internal methodology and are indicated by footnotes in the respective tables.\n\nFor a detailed overview, please see the index tables related to the frameworks SASB, WEF IBC, Zurich sustainability pillars, as well as the index table related to the key metrics 3 of our planet section on our website. Furthermore, we have used references to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), without adhering to the standards listed in the index 4 in its entirety.\n\n- 1 Comprising Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group or Zurich or we).\n- 2  www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/strategy\n- 3  www.zurich.com/sustainability/reporting\n- 4  www.zurich.com/sustainability/reporting",

When looking to the future, we are confident we will thrive based on our tradition and grow based on our purpose.\n\nWe are convinced that living up to our purpose will strengthen our core business and have a positive impact on our performance as an underwriter and investor. With changing customer expectations and an increasing demand for social and environmental engagement, sustainability is increasingly becoming a driver for value creation. Evolving legislation and the increasingly visible impacts of climate change underline the urgency of the topic.\n\nWe are supporting our customers who face these risks and we are enhancing preventative advisory solutions to complement traditional underwriting services. In Chapter 5 (pages 170 to 180), you can read about the innovative and sustainable solutions we offer to our customers to enhance resilience and advocate for prevention or minimization of damage and harm from climate-related perils. We continue to focus on the development of insurance and risk management solutions for new technologies, business models and approaches that are needed to achieve a climate-neutral economy. Additionally, we continue to develop new solutions and increase revenues associated with sustainable products and services.\n\nThe ownership and management of assets carries broad responsibilities. In addition to traditional financial considerations, we have established a responsible investment approach which covers climate risk and integrates environmental and social metrics to assess our performance in sustainability. Accordingly, our climate-related strategy must be understood as feeding into a broader sustainable approach to investment management. For more details, please see Chapter 4 (pages 131 to 169) of this report.\n\n## 2.2 Our targets and positions\n\nWe believe social responsibility and care for our planet are aligned with shareholders' interests. Sustainability is a business opportunity as well as an urgent global imperative. Our ambition is to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. This means creating positive outcomes for all stakeholders, taking economic, social and environmental considerations into account.\n\nWe have set ourselves ambitious targets and report transparently about our progress throughout the year. Moreover, additional targets were set in 2022 and underline our ambition.\n\n## Investment management\n\n| Our areas of focus                                                                                                    | Our progress                        | Our progress                        | Our progress                        | Our targets                         | Our targets                         | Our targets                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                       | 2020 to 2022                        | 2020 to 2022                        | 2020 to 2022                        | 2025                                | 2050                                | Targets without   a deadline        |\n| Reduction of financed emissions                                                                                       | Reduction of financed emissions     | Reduction of financed emissions     | Reduction of financed emissions     | Reduction of financed emissions     | Reduction of financed emissions     | Reduction of financed emissions     |\n| Reduce emissions intensity of listed   equity and corporate bond investments  (metric tons CO2e/USD million invested) | 2020                                | 2021                                | 2022                                | -25%                                | Net-zero  investment  portfolio     |                                     |\n| (compared to 2019)                                                                                                    | -6%                                 | -21%                                | -12%                                | -25%                                | Net-zero  investment  portfolio     |                                     |\n| Reduce emissions intensity of direct real  estate investments  (kgCO2e/m 2 )                                          | 2020                                | 2021                                | -12%                                | -30%                                | Net-zero  investment  portfolio     |                                     |\n| (compared to 2019)                                                                                                    | -6%                                 | -20%                                | -12%                                |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Engagement targets - Climate action                                                                                   | Engagement targets - Climate action | Engagement targets - Climate action | Engagement targets - Climate action | Engagement targets - Climate action | Engagement targets - Climate action | Engagement targets - Climate action |\n| Engage companies producing 65% of                                                                                     |                                     | 2021                                | 2022                                | 65%                                 |                                     |                                     |\n| portfolio emissions and lacking targets  aligned with Paris Agreement (PA)                                            |                                     | 46%                                 | 54%                                 | 65%                                 |                                     |                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that taking an integrated approach is the key to our success, hence we place sustainability at the core of our organization and stakeholder interactions.\n\nWe are conscious of the impact we have on people and planet and we keep this in mind in our own operations, investment portfolio and underwriting. As well as embedding sustainability across all functional units, we also set high expectations for all our business units around the world. We combine top-down and bottom-up initiatives to engage all regions. Through this hybrid approach, we ensure all countries can contribute toward the same goals.\n\n## Sustainability is integrated in everything we do\n\nFigure 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Operations                   | Underwriting                                    | Investing                        | Customers                             | Employees                   | Partners and  communities   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Net-zero targets   for 2030  | Climate resilience for  customers and portfolio | Net-zero approach   to investing | Strengthen customers'  sustainability | Employee skill  development | Sustainable sourcing        |\n| 100% renewable  power target | Net-zero insurance   baseline                   | Active owership                  | Data commitment                       | Diversity, equity,          | Contribute to  communities  |\n|                              |                                                 | Impact investing                 | Customer care                         | inclusion and belonging     | Enhance climate             |\n| 100% electric   fleet target | Sustainability in  business transactions        |                                  |                                       | Well-being                  | resilience                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a founding member of the Net-zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) Zurich has committed to 'Transitioning all operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to netzero emissions by 2050 consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 in order to contribute to the implementation of the COP21 Paris Agreement.' We were heavily involved in developing the common methodology and target setting protocol (TSP) that will allow NZIA member organizations to individually set science-based targets for their underwriting portfolios in line with a 1.5\u00b0C net-zero transition pathway. The TSP sets out the minimum requirements for all members to set their initial interim targets, with one target to be set by the end of July 2023 and targets in all three categories defined by the protocol by the end of July 2024. The TSP structures targets into three areas:\n\n- - Engagement with customers.\n- - Portfolio emission reductions.\n- - Insuring the transition.\n\n## 2.3.1 Assessing materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to work together with our employees, customers, investors and society to create a brighter future. To do this, it is necessary to involve these stakeholder groups in our decision-making process - and to understand what issues matter most to them. As the field of sustainability is rapidly evolving and we strive to have a clear view on the most material issues going forward, we\n\nconduct a full materiality assessment every three years as part of our strategic cycles.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out a complete update to our materiality assessment in order to understand which sustainability-related issues are most relevant to internal and external stakeholders. The 2022 assessment included both quantitative and qualitative analyses, insights generated from leading big data tools, and direct engagement with 10 different stakeholder groups including more than 8000 employees and 500 customers. Using this information, we identified 23 sustainability topics and prioritized them based on their importance to our stakeholders (y-axis) and their potential for future business impact (x-axis).\n\nThe outcomes of the 2022 materiality assessment were key inputs for creating our new strategic cycle and sustainability framework. This refreshed framework builds upon our previous three sustainability pillars 1 and will take effect in 2023. The results illustrated in the matrix below have been validated through numerous expert interviews. The purpose of these interviews was to validate the results and provide input to defining the next three-year strategic cycle for sustainability. A few topics were slightly moved to the right, meaning that the experts estimated the potential business impact to be higher than initially indicated by the surveys. As a final step, the Board endorsed the materiality matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 2.3.2 Managing risks and opportunities\n\nFigure 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo carry out effective sustainability risk management, we consider the impact of our company on the planet and society (a so-called inside-out perspective), as well as the impact of climate and society on our company's core business (an outside-in perspective). Known as 'double materiality,' this approach helps us to understand sustainability risks, for example climate\n\nchange, as a driver of the key risks in our risk taxonomy. It also enables us to establish a position on societal risks, such as the use of banned weapons, or forced or child labor (human rights risks). The sustainability risk framework addresses the process of identifying, assessing and mitigating risks largely from an inside-out perspective, whereas other approaches, such as scenario-based climate risk assessment (see Capter 4), are used to understand the risks from an outside-in perspective.\n\nFigure 5\n\nDouble materiality 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur risk management framework helps to protect our company against financial and reputational risks and supports the identification of potential business opportunities. ESG integration is a core pillar of our responsible investment strategy for these same reasons.\n\nTo help our business mitigate risks, maximize opportunities and manage the inside-out impact of our company, we have established a systematic and integrated approach to identifying and assessing the potential impact of sustainability issues. This approach also helps us to recommend proper response strategies, which can include the development of new products and services that support our customers in managing sustainability issues. The approach is applied across all Group activities and, in particular, in investment management and underwriting.\n\nRisk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk identification\n\nIdentify and prioritize risks from various sources (ESG research, social and traditional media, NGOs, businesses) to go through our risk assessment process.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nFilter risks through public commitments, role of insurance, underwriting risk assessment, market exposure assessment, etc. Our Group CEO approves a position statement on the risk, including recommendations for business actions and reputational risk management considerations.\n\n## Implementation\n\nBusinesses locally implement mitigation actions and reputational management plans. Support is available from experts across the Group and escalation follows normal governance procedures.\n\nWe have used our proprietary risk-profiling methodology since 2012 to prioritize key sustainability risks that need to be monitored across all our business transactions. These include:\n\n- - Banned weapons, avoiding business involving the manufacture, sale, distribution or stockpiling of cluster weapons or anti-personnel mines.\n- - Thermal coal, oil sand and oil shale unless formally approved science-based targets are in place (and engagement on phase out of OECD and EU 27 by 2030 and rest of world by 2040).\n\nFor other sustainability issues, we believe that proactively integrating sustainability risks and opportunities - expressed in ESG factors in our investment decisions across asset classes and alongside traditional financial metrics and state-ofthe-art risk management practices - will support us in our mission to achieve superior risk-adjusted long-term financial returns (ESG integration).\n\n- 1 The diagram represents the double materiality perspective of the EU Non-financial Reporting Directive.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 2.3.2 Managing risks and opportunities (continued)\n\nSpecifically for underwriting we also include monitoring of:\n\n- - New greenfield oil exploration projects (unless meaningful transition plans are in place).\n- - Respect for human rights, in particular avoiding business involving child labor, forced labor, poor health and safety conditions or unfair remuneration.\n- - Dam construction, avoiding unacceptable social, political or environmental risks of specific dam construction projects.\n- - Oil and gas operations and mining operations, avoiding risks involving damage to protected areas or critical natural habitats, corruption and human rights abuses.\n- -  Oil and gas drilling and production in the Arctic. 1\n\nThe framework is also used to establish proper response strategies, 2 for example, avoiding risks by divestment or underweighting assets, 3 or not underwriting certain activities, such as our thermal coal, oil sand and oil shale position.\n\n## Scenario-based climate risk assessment\n\nFirst performed in 2021 and updated in 2022, it is our most prominent and detailed outside-in risk evaluation. The assessment used a range of scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and applied these across our core underwriting and investment portfolios to understand potential physical risks and risks associated with the transition to a net-zero economy. We understand a net-zero economy to be a world aligned with the Paris Agreement, where greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions reabsorbed from the atmosphere by negative-emission technologies or by oceans or forests. The climate risk assessment demonstrates that, overall, the financial impact of transitioning in the mid-term (by 2030) is modelled to be relatively low under current scenarios. This is largely due to diversification across lines of business and regions with the exception of potential losses arising from physical climate change risks. However, these can be addressed through continued best-in-class climate modeling and a focus on reshaping property portfolios, should aspects of the more severe scenario begin to materialize.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our scenario based climate risk assessment:\n\nin section 4.1.4 to 4.1.9 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis, pages 138 to 153.\n\n## Supporting the transition\n\nThe assessment also helped us identify the lines of business in which we have an opportunity to support certain industries in their transition to net-zero, principally in the construction and energy industries. As a risk manager, we are positioned to play an important role in the energy transition, now further accelerated owing to the war in Ukraine, helping organizations understand risks and opportunities and make informed decisions that are aligned with net-zero and ESG commitments. We are doing this both through our alternative energy offerings as well as through our Zurich Resilience Solutions. Further opportunities arising from a proactive management of sustainability risks include, for example, on the life insurance side, an increased offering of unit-linked products investing in funds focused on sustainable environmental and social factors, e.g., USD 36 million invested in ESG funds. For further information on the impact and management of these risks, as well as the business opportunities they can bring, see the planet section (page 131 to 169) and the customer section (page 171 to 175).\n\n## 2.4 Involving our stakeholders\n\nThe success of our sustainability strategy greatly depends on the willingness of our stakeholders to be involved in, and contribute to, our ambitions. For further details on our interactions with customers and employees, please see pages 170 to 180 and 181 to 189, respectively. In addition, we strive to involve our investors, suppliers and vendors, as well as the communities in which we operate, in diverse ways. We frequently interact with groups such as regulators, NGOs and industry associations.\n\n## 2.4.1 Investors\n\nA demonstrable commitment to sustainability is of critical importance to many of our investors. We are proactive in developing and communicating our sustainability strategy, particularly on the topics that are most material to investors, such as climate resilience and adaptation, decarbonization, business ethics and conduct, and Board leadership and effectiveness.\n\nWe engage consistently and openly with investors, analysts, rating agencies and proxy advisors. As part of our outreach, we have established dedicated annual interactions between our Board and investors to explain our sustainability strategy and performance. In particular, we have set additional targets for the upcoming strategic cycle and will report on them. In our ESG roadshow 4 conducted by the Chairman of the Board in November 2022, for example, we have highlighted that we are placing sustainability at the core of our organization and stakeholder interactions.\n\n- 1 Considered as anything north of 66 degrees latitude with the exception of the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n- 2  www.zurich.com/sustainability/governance-and-policies/exclusion-policies\n- 3  www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-at-zurich.pdf\n- 4  www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/investor-relations/docs/investors/2022-esg-presentation.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 2.4.1 Investors (continued)\n\nThis engagement gives us invaluable insights into investors' rapidly developing expectations and supports the development of our strategy toward a more sustainable future.\n\n## 2.4.2 Sustainable sourcing\n\nWe are expanding our efforts to interact with partners in a way that supports our values. As part of this, we have established a sustainable sourcing program. 1 The program aims to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, supports our commitment to the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C 2 and creates a positive social impact.\n\nIt comprises three pillars, which address environmental, social and ethical factors. Its objective is to embed these factors throughout the sourcing cycle, align suppliers with our values and be transparent about our expectations. We have developed a supplier code of conduct (SCOC) 3 to lay a clear foundation for systematically integrating responsible business conduct in our supply chain.\n\nBy asking our suppliers to comply with this code, we aspire to use our influence as a significant buyer of goods and services to accelerate the adoption of sustainable business practices among our suppliers.\n\nFigure 7 Sustainable sourcing program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to engage suppliers with our SCOC, globally. The first step in our supplier engagement includes providing access to training videos and asking suppliers to carry out a self-assessment to determine how they perform against the expectations set out in the SCOC. We then review the self-assessment results and audit a sample of the responses internally. As of the end of 2022, we confirmed that 71.5 percent of our MPS 4 is with suppliers that meet or exceed the key expectations of our SCOC, pursuant to their self-assessment. While this falls slightly short of our target of 75 percent, we remain committed to driving sustainability performance within our supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, we will offer additional tools and resources for suppliers to use within their own businesses to improve their sustainability performance, such as a carbon emissions calculator, training videos and policy statement templates. The tools are designed to address common areas in which multiple suppliers fall short of our expectations. We will continue to work with our suppliers to address these areas in the short to medium term. Where our engagement fails and suppliers cannot, or refuse to, embed the minimum standards, we will review the relationship and consider phasing it out to protect our commitment to doing the right thing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human rights risk assessment\n\nWe respect the protection of international human rights within our sphere of influence and work hard to avoid being complicit in human rights abuses.\n\nTo determine our exposure to potential human rights violations in our supply chain, we analyzed the fundamental human rights set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Our analysis sought to identify which, if any, of these fundamental human rights presented a potential violation risk to suppliers within our tier-one supply chain, i.e. those suppliers with whom we have a direct buying contract. Our analysis identified a limited potential for violation of certain human rights, though our overall exposure to such incidents is considered low. Our analysis also concluded that the labor standards and workplace practices operated by our suppliers are a critical factor in the likelihood of a human rights violation occurring.\n\nWe then studied the types of supplier for whom the risk of violating these identified human rights was most significant. Using data and reports from reputable NGOs and our own internal expert judgement, we have identified high-risk countries and high-risk goods and services. Our assessment of high-risk goods and services categories is based upon the prevalence of human rights issues reported and an assessment of working practices at industry or sector level.\n\nOur assessment of high-risk countries is based on:\n\n- - The reported prevalence of human rights issues.\n- - The degree of respect for worker rights, based upon local laws and actual practices.\n- - The extent of political freedom and civil liberties.\n- - The extent of corruption.\n- 1 www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/sustainable-sourcing\n- 2  UN Global Compact - Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C: www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/climate-action-summit-2019/business-ambition\n- 3  www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/sustainable-sourcing\n- 4  The spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function according to the 2020 baseline on goods and services that are required to enable Zurich to maintain and develop its operations, excluding suppliers no longer active in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The TPGF adopts a risk-based approach to ensure onboarding and management measures, such as thirdparty due diligence processes, are relevant and proportionate to the nature and risk of any particular transaction. We have started implementing the TPGF across the Group in 2022 and and we expect to complete the implementation by the end of March 2023.\n\nThe aim of our due diligence is to seek assurance that the supplier has relevant measures in place to respect fundamental human rights. We have a referral process in place to investigate or resolve, as appropriate, any red flags identified during the due diligence process. We also use a software tool that uses artificial intelligence to screen news reports, social media posts and NGO reports to monitor potential ESG-related supply chain issues.\n\n## 2.4.3 Responsible tax 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to be recognized as a responsible member of the communities in which we operate and as a contributor to their prosperity.

It is creating a brighter future for vulnerable people with the aim to positively impact at least 11 million people worldwide by 2024.\n\nIn 2022, natural disasters have impacted thousands of people, adding to the challenges many continue to face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, millions of people have fled the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Foundation has continued to support the most vulnerable by providing tailored grants to support local disaster relief initiatives identified by our business units. Our employees also went above and beyond to support the most vulnerable, mobilizing their networks to best respond to crises. We are proud of our collective efforts and the Foundation's highlights for 2022 include:\n\n- - Dedicated response to support people fleeing Ukraine from the first day of the war, including a global and public fundraising campaign.\n- - The Foundation and UNICEF launched the Global Coalition for Youth Mental Well-being, which Zurich joined as a strategic member. Its first action was to raise funds for programs to support the mental well-being of young refugees who have fled Ukraine.\n- - An additional donation from the Foundation to UNICEF to help deliver COVID-19 vaccines to about 30 countries with vaccination rates below 15 percent.\n- - Significant developments of the Foundation's three strategic pillars: 'adapting to climate change', 'improving mental well-being' and 'enabling social equity'. These include signing new partnerships in countries where we have an existing commercial presence as well as those where we do not (e.g., Africa and India).\n- - Twenty-seven new multi-year grant programs to support projects under the Foundation's strategic areas.\n- - Twenty-five Community Hero Awards presented to recognize those Zurich employees who go above and beyond to support their communities.\n\nIn addition to the work driven by the Foundation, our local business units also hold smaller budgets to account for local needs and priorities.\n\n## Table 1\n\n## Employee fundraising and volunteering 2021 figures 1, 2\n\nTable 2\n\n|                                                        | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Fundraising and donations (USD millions)  3            | 3.3    | 2.5    | 32%      |\n| Total time volunteered by workforce (business hours)   | 49,736 | 38,830 | 28%      |\n| of which skills-based hours                            | 16,667 | 19,485 | (14%)    |\n| Workforce actively volunteering (% of total headcount) | 12.3%  | 9.3%   | 3 ppts   |\n\n- 1 All figures exclude Farmers Exchanges.

Independent assurance report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents our disclosure in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's TCFD. It outlines our understanding of the potential impacts of climate risk to our underwriting and investment activities and an assessment of the resilience of our strategy to climate change risk. Also outlined is the governance we have established to make climate and\n\nsustainability an executive-level responsibility, our climate risk management processes and finally the metrics and targets we have implemented to track delivery of our stated targets. While climate change is the focal point of this section, we are dedicated to environmental aspects in a broader sense, e.g., revenues resulting from sustainable solutions, see Chapter 5 (pages 171 to 175).\n\n## 4.1 Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning.\n\nOur climate strategy focuses on supporting companies and people through the transition to a net-zero economy and demonstrates our commitment to using every lever of our business, from underwriting and investments to our own operations, to accelerate this transition.\n\n## 4.1.1 Our climate-related strategy\n\n## Understanding and integrating climate risk into the way we conduct business\n\nUnderstanding and managing the impact of climate change is an important aspect of maintaining our long-term profitability. Our approach to climate risk is part of our risk management process across the Group. It is managed in a way that is consistent with other risks to which the Group is exposed. We integrate assessments of the evolving physical and transition risk landscape into our underwriting and investment strategies.\n\n## Natural catastrophe modeling\n\nTo manage our climate risks more effectively, we are investing in improving our understanding of them. Modeling the effects of physical risk on our portfolios is a key focus area. While climate change models are constantly improving, they remain less accurate at the smaller spatial resolutions needed to analyze in detail the impact of changes to natural catastrophes on our portfolio. In contrast, traditional commercial catastrophe models that form the basis of our current modeling are typically based on historical data and hence would not reflect future changes in trends. For this reason, we have started to combine climate change scenarios and natural catastrophe models to complement our framework with a view of climate change, and to integrate this view into our accumulation-risk and peril-region modeling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more about natural catastrophe modeling:\n\nin section 4.1.3, pages 135 to 137.\n\n## Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis\n\nA deep understanding of potential medium- to long-term impacts of climate change risk to our underwriting and investment portfolios is fundamental to formulating appropriate strategic responses. We undertake scenario analysis on our portfolios to understand what these impacts are.\n\nOur first exploratory, scenario-based climate risk assessment, performed in 2021, considered outcomes from 2030 onward, with impacts quantified where possible. This exploratory exercise considered major aspects of our business, including underwriting, investment management and our own operations. In 2022, we reviewed the risk assessments performed in 2021 and updated them where needed. As the mix of our underwriting portfolio did not change significantly in 2022 compared with our 2020 baseline, the heatmap published in Annual Report 2021 remains valid. Besides monitoring, we prioritised strategic actions in our underwriting portfolio and strengthened the assessment of our investment portfolio by including additional asset classes. In terms of our own operations, we reviewed further risks, including the impact of climate change on our distributed workforce and our supply chain.\n\nOutcomes of these analyses are used to determine appropriate responses and ensure the resilience of our strategy. We disclose the outcomes of these processes in line with TCFD recommendations and to demonstrate our understanding and management of these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis:\n\nin section 4.1.4 to 4.1.9 pages 138 to 153.\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks\n\nIn alignment with TCFD recommendations, we broadly categorize climate-related risks as physical and/or transition risk and outline below the potential impacts of these risks on our business. In sections 4.1.5 to 4.1.9 we discuss in detail our own assessment and the expected impact from climate-related physical and transition risk. We outline our understanding of how climate change risk could impact our business activities, mainly focusing on the impact on demand (revenues) and losses (claims) from an insurance perspective and on assets from an investment perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Latest research shows that changes in extreme weather events can be attributed to human-induced increases in global surface temperatures and suggests continuing trends in emissions will further exacerbate the situation.\n\nThese developments will bring negative economic and societal impacts as extreme weather events increase in severity and frequency or undergo geographic shifts. The scientific understanding of how weather events will respond to climate change varies greatly, but we assume that further temperature increases will accelerate sea-level rise due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and icesheets. It will also lead to more extreme temperatures, heatwaves and droughts, impacting agricultural production and human productivity. 1 As the warming atmosphere will also intensify evaporation, more extreme precipitation and variability in the global water cycle is seen as highly likely.\n\nThere is less certainty around how other weather events will react to climate change, such as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, severe convective storms and hail. Secondary effects of climate change can also have negative impacts, such as extreme heat and drought leading to more wildfires, or the combination of sea-level rise and changes in hurricane intensity or tracks leading to higher storm-surge damage.\n\n## Impact to demand and loss profiles\n\nUp to 2030, we expect changes driven by climate change to become increasingly relevant. However, these changes stop short of becoming a dominant loss driver over and above what is currently embedded into our risk appetite. We expect the inherent volatility and natural variability of extreme weather events and socioeconomic trends will continue to have a stronger influence on loss experience. Natural variability comes both from random fluctuations of extreme but rare events and multi-year variations in regional climate systems, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation or Atlantic-Multidecadal Oscillation. This variability is also embedded in historic loss trends and taken into account in our pricing and capital management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact to insurer's balance sheet\n\n## Liabilities (insurance)\n\n- -  Changes in and shift of demand for products and services across geographies/ sectors/ lines of business\n- -  Changes in loss ratios and profits\n- -  Changes in loss frequency\n- -  Changes in loss severity\n\n## Assets (investments)\n\n- -  Valuation changes\n- -  Changes in default rates",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks (continued)\n\nSocio-economic trends, such as an increase in asset values and accumulation through population growth and concentration in urban areas, also contribute to increases in losses over time. The impact of such trends is considered in pricing and modeling, such that annual policy renewals provide mitigation against increasing physical risks for shorttail business and mitigate transition risk to the underwriting portfolio.\n\nThrough certain lines of business, we can be directly impacted by the changes in physical risk caused by climate change. The impacts include, for example, increases in severity and frequency of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, flood or hail, which can lead to higher losses by customers covered by our property policies. Other lines are less sensitive to physical risk and, within these, only a minority of our losses are driven by natural catastrophes (see the current exposure to physical risk section, pages 135 to 137.\n\n## Impact through valuation changes\n\nBuildings may be at risk, due to their fixed locations, of suffering significant damage costs from the impact of climate change. We are currently exploring ways to assess physical risks for properties using our risk model on catastrophes and by integrating data into our central portfolio management system. The valuation of assets in our investment portfolio can also be affected by direct and indirect exposure to physical risk.\n\nBusinesses will be directly affected by impact on costs and revenues and the potential for supply chain disruptions and asset write-offs. The vulnerability of countries to physical risk, including costs associated with infrastructure and adaptation measures, disruptions and vulnerability to extreme weather events, may also have an impact on the valuation of sovereign debt.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nFigure 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate-related transition risk\n\n## Climate transition risk\n\n## Policy and legal\n\n- -  Increased pricing of GHG emissions and removal of subsidies\n- -  Enhanced reporting requirements\n- -  Restrictions on products and technologies\n\n## Technology\n\n- -  New low-carbon technologies\n- -  New energy efficiency technologies\n\n## Market and sentiment\n\n- -  Changing customer behavior and consumer preferences\n- -  Stigmatization of sectors and technologies\n- -  Changed cost of production inputs\n\n## Impact channels\n\n## Changes in demand\n\n- -  Increasing demand for low-carbon products and materials\n- -  Reduced demand for carbon-intense technologies and products\n\n## Changes in costs\n\n- -  Direct carbon costs\n- -  Changes in operating costs (supply chain, commodity costs, compliance, new production processes)\n- -  Abatement\n\n## Competition and pass-through effects\n\n- -  Shifts in market share\n- -  Passing costs through to end customers\n- -  Products and services with low price elasticity\n\nIf society moves to limit global warming in line with the Paris Agreement to below 2\u00b0C, and optimally to 1.5\u00b0C, the required decarbonization of the global economy will bring its own set of risks. The legal, policy, technological and market changes necessary for the transition will lead to significant shifts in economic activity and asset valuation.\n\n## Impact to demand and loss profiles\n\nThe expected steep rise in carbon prices and removal of subsidies on carbon-intensive resources and activities in this transition could lead to reduced profitability, stranded assets and impairments in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize and where additional costs cannot be passed on to customers.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks (continued)\n\nFor example, the transition will shift demand for insurance toward low-carbon technologies and products, creating opportunities for companies that provide new solutions or are able to reduce their emissions more efficiently than competitors.\n\nThe aggregate effect of transition risk will vary greatly across individual actors, depending on their detailed business models, assets and transition strategy. This complicates the assessment of aggregate transition impacts. There will also be aggregate macro effects arising in a transitioning scenario, including the impact on economic activity, inflation and, potentially, government borrowing costs.\n\nAs new policy measures and technologies are rolled out, uncertainties around their effectiveness and unintended consequences are likely to increase, with higher market volatility and uncertain loss ratios among possible outcomes. Transition risk will be highly dependent on how predictable policy responses are and the time available for the economy to decarbonize. More disruptive impacts can be anticipated with a faster transition.\n\n## Impact through valuation changes and other drivers\n\nIn the commercial real estate sector, transition risk will manifest from the need to adhere to tighter policies, carbon and energy costs, market preferences and challenges to achieve energy efficiency and may impact asset values.\n\nThe transition will also bring legal or litigation risks. Carbon-intense energy producers are already defending lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for their alleged historical contribution to CO2e emissions. This current litigation could expand to other industries whose operations contribute to CO2 or other climate-impacting emissions. Companies may be sued for failing to disclose climate-related risks, for failing to mitigate the impact of their activities on climate change, for allegedly misrepresenting their level of climate impact, or for failing to adapt to the changing climate. Asset managers could be sued for financing climate change-inducing activities, or for inadequately driving emission reductions in their portfolios.\n\nThe global transition to a greener society will also bring with it new and emerging technologies. These could also present new opportunities as well as unanticipated risks and new environmental concerns from both a resourcing and disposal aspect. Extreme weather events could present new risks to employers regarding worker safety or to companies engaged in building design, engineering and construction. Governments could enact laws seeking to hold companies accountable for the climate impact of their supply chains.\n\n## 4.1.3 Natural catastrophe modeling: current exposure to physical risk 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Approach\n\nCurrent exposures to physical climate risk are expressed through annual expected loss (AEL) and probable maximum loss (PML). Modeled exposures are shown below. 2 Our approach to modeling is discussed further in the section on managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes (pages 154-155). We highlight how various drivers including exposed insurance portfolio and vulnerability changes, model updates, exposure data quality, foreign exchange rates and reinsurance can influence natural catastrophe modeling output (e.g., AEL, PML) over time.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe climate risk assessment is applied to our portfolios, namely the exposure of our Property and Casualty business to natural catastrophe perils, impacted by climate change that could materially impact us.\n\n## Quantification\n\n## AEL\n\nAEL provides a view on the expected loss due to natural catastrophes per year, averaged over many years.\n\n## PML\n\nPML is a tail metric that looks at severe, unexpected but still possible outcomes of natural catastrophes at a defined probability of occurrence.\n\n## Monetary losses\n\nAmount of monetary losses attributable to insurance payouts from natural catastrophes.\n\n- 1 Results from the Q4 2022 Group Catastrophe Model are presented in the analysis shown below. There are timing differences in the underlying exposures considered in this analysis (underlying exposures by peril region are generally as of June or September 2022, and in exceptional cases as of September or December 2021).\n- 2  Countries comprising the peril regions referred to here are as follows:\n- - Central Europe Hail: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n- -   Europe Wind: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.\n- - Europe Flood: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the UK, plus other small nations like Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, San Marino and Vatican.\n- - CB, MX and U.S. Hurricane: Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We follow the Group's Catastrophe Response Group (CRG) governance for natural catastrophe identification. Here we\n\nreport events where the total net loss is above USD 200 million. The Hurricane Ian event and figure has been reviewed by the CRG, a cross-functional committee which oversees and recommends to the ExCo the best-estimate ultimate loss for material catastrophes. The term 'catastrophe' in the context of the CRG covers both man-made and natural catastrophe peril events that are relatively infrequent or are phenomena that produce unusually large aggregate losses.\n\n## Total amount of net losses in USDm 1\n\nTable 3\n\n| Event name (by event and region)   |   Total net losses in USDm |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Hurricane Ian (hurricane, NA)      |                        485 |\n| Total                              |                        485 |\n\n- 1 Only events above USD 200 million are reported.\n\nAn important aspect of our proprietary view on natural catastrophe risk is the evaluation of patterns and trends in catastrophe activity with time. Natural variability of event activity is an integral part of our view on natural catastrophe risk, as are statistically significant trends that may be detectable in our claims experience or credible, conclusive modeling of past, present and future climate as a driver of loss activity. We regularly revisit our risk views and underlying models on climate-related perils in order to reflect trends in the hazard, whereas exposure trends are naturally captured by exposure data updates. In 2022, we enhanced our risk view on European flood that reflects the loss correlation across countries. Natural variability is at the same time evaluated and kept up-to-date as part of the regular reviews of our natural catastrophe risk view, which underpins the structuring and purchase of reinsurance along with the profitability assessment and strategic capacity allocation for risk assumed from customers.\n\nWe follow a gross-line underwriting strategy and focus substantial time and resources on ensuring risk-adequate underwriting and pricing of the business we assume up-front, including consideration of potential climate changeinduced trends. Reinsurance is used as a means to maximize diversification of net retained risks and to protect shareholders against earnings volatility. We engage with a core panel of reinsurance partners to secure the required capacity at sustainable pricing over the medium term. Given our financial strength, we have the option to weigh the benefits and cost of reinsurance against other forms of risk financing and thus adapt to supply-side changes in the reinsurance market as a potential consequence of the macroeconomic response to climate change adaptation.\n\n- 1 Our disclosure shows our efforts to provide additional details, however it is acknowledged that full compliance is not envisaged e.g., due to our reporting standards (no disclosure of gross losses), or our industry's catastrophe modeling standards. There are generally no catastrophe models available for example, for chronic diseases, droughts and extreme heat and therefore no PMLs can be provided. Tsunami risk is correlated (and modelled) with seismic risk and therefore cannot be reported on a standalone basis as part of insured products from weather-related natural catastrophes, which is the scope of the standard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.4 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis\n\nIn the chapter below, we have labelled the sub-sections that are specific to one of our three impact areas: underwriting, investment management or own operations.\n\n## Legend of icons used\n\nFigure 14 Figure X: NGFS scenario framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Approach\n\nOur assessment of climate risk leverages both our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology and scenario analysis. 1 While Total Risk Profiling\u2122 offers a short term (1-3 years) qualitative risk assessment, scenario analysis allows us to assess the strategic implications of climate change over the medium (up to 10 years) and longer term (to 2050) and improves our ability to assess the resilience of our business model to potential climate risks.\n\nThe scenarios used to analyze our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios are drawn from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) suite, with scenarios chosen to cover a relevant set of emissions pathways. The emissions pathways of the selected scenarios correspond broadly to representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0. 2\n\n## Scenarios used\n\nNet-zero 2050 limits global warming to 1.5\u00b0C through early adoption of stringent climate policies and innovation. Net-zero emissions reached around 2050, giving at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot (<0.1 \u00b0C) of 1.5\u00b0C in earlier years.\n\n## NGFS scenario framework 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nFor details on the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology and scenarios analysis process, see the risk management section (pages 154 to 156).\n\n- 2  As described by NGFS, 'the RCPs are greenhouse gas concentration scenarios that are commonly used in the climate modeling community. They were officially adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and provide a basis for the projections and predictions of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC.' The correspondence between NGFS scenarios and RCP pathways is based on the emissions trajectory in those scenarios over time. The correspondence is not exact, but NGFS net-zero 2050 and disorderly scenario temperature pathways fall in the range of RCP 2.6, and current policies fall in the range of RCP 6.0. (More details available in the NGFS technical documentation).\n- 3  www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal. Mapping compared to 2021 scenario names: no additional action (NAA) became current policies, late action became delayed transition and early action became net-zero 2050.\n- 4  These correspond to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, according to the new designations from the IPCC.\n\nDelayed transition assumes no new climate policies until 2030 with high regional variation in policy implementation. Emissions exceed the carbon budget temporarily and decline more rapidly to ensure a 67 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C.\n\nCurrent policies assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks. Emissions grow until 2080 leading to about 3\u00b0C of warming and severe physical risks.\n\nThe selected scenarios used for underwriting and investment management analyses cover a broad scope of potential risks and opportunities, including high and low physical and transition risks.\n\nThe scenarios used to understand physical risk impacts to our own operations are broadly aligned with those used for our insurance and investment analysis in terms of the RCP assumed (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) 4 . Our scenario analysis leverages a third-party model and associated data to assess both our insurance and investment businesses. A high-level overview of the model, data sources and key assumptions are provided in the risk management section (pages 154 to 156).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our planet: Drive positive impact (continued)\n\n## 4.1.4 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis (continued)\n\n## Scope 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting\n\nThe analysis of our Group portfolio uses third-party modeling to understand the potential relationship between key climate drivers and insurance demand and loss experience. The scope of the analysis was determined as follows:\n\n## Analysis of the Group by:\n\nLines of business\n\nIndustry/sector\n\nRegion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet of nine clusters with potentially high exposure to physical and transition risk representing:\n\n49% of P&C\n\n37% of Life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Each cluster was analyzed in depth for:\n\nImpact on demands\n\nImpact on losses\n\n## Quantification\n\nUnderwriting and investment management require different approaches to understand potential impacts of climate risk.\n\nConcerning our underwriting portfolio, we decided to quantify impacts for 2030 and perform a qualitative analysis for 2050. The outcome of the 2030 analysis is used to define strategic actions, for which the much longer time frame (2050) would be less relevant.\n\nGiven the model-based nature of investment analysis, impacts to asset valuations can be assessed over multiple timeframes. As we aim to understand the impact of climate risk on the different asset classes over a longer time, we made the decision to conduct quantitative analyses and disclose the results for 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting\n\nQuantification is performed to underpin our medium-term assessment (to 2030). This approach is reasonable for determining how to manage identified risks due to the flexibility of adapting a high proportion of our portfolio through annual policy renewals. Given the increasing uncertainty inherent in considering longer time periods, impacts to 2050 are analyzed qualitatively.\n\nTwo metrics are chosen to quantify scenario-based impacts of climate risk on our insurance business:\n\n- -Percentage change in demand is the estimated impact on size and composition of demand for insurance products due to the drivers of physical and transition climate risk in each scenario, compared with a 2030 baseline. This baseline does not take into account any further climate action or climate change relative to present-day levels but reflects modeled impacts on demand (or losses) from GDP changes and industry sector growth or decline.\n- -Percentage change in expected losses is the estimated impact on claims due to the drivers of physical and transition climate risk in each scenario, compared with a 2030 baseline. This baseline does not take into account any further climate action or climate change relative to present-day levels but reflects modeled impacts on demand (or losses) from GDP changes and industry sector growth or decline.\n\nInvestment Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe valuation of equity in the scenarios involves discounting future revenues and costs (quantified at 2050) to arrive at a net present value of future cash flows.\n\nCorporate credit impact is estimated by translating changes in equity valuations to changes in fixed-income instrument default risk and associated loss, using a ratings-based Altman Z-score 2 model and the Frye-Jacobs PDLGD relationship, 3 respectively.\n\nReal estate impairments due to transition and physical risk are estimated by country and property type. Transition risks are based on country-level emissions data for residential and commercial real estate (scope 1 and 2). The physical risk impacts to real estate use a third-party risk model, including coastal flooding, river flooding and tropical cyclones. The combined impact of transition and physical risks is calculated by multiplying the reduced valuation associated with impacts from transition and physical risk.\n\nSovereign bond impact reflects the macroeconomic shocks arising from changes in energy consumption, energy costs and the physical risks of climate change, as well as the response of governments and central banks to those shocks. The model uses macroeconomic outputs from NiGEM 4 to calculate changes in nominal forward interest rates and changes in default risk premia per risk scenario.\n\n- 1 For more details concerning the scenario analysis performed on our own operations, please see pages 151 to 152.\n\n2  Altman (2019): 50 Years of Altman Z-score: what have we learned and the applications in financial and managerial markets. https://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/images/Evolution%20of%20Altman%20\n\nZ-Score.lse.pdf\n\n## Investment Management\n\nThe scenario-based assessment of our proprietary investment portfolio considers listed equities, corporate credit, real estate and a separate analysis of sovereign debt. Listed equities, corporate credit and real estate cover 36 percent of our proprietary investment portfolio and make a significant contribution to our investment-related market risk position as of 2021.\n\nWithin each asset class, the third-party model covers between 70 and 100 percent of investment management holdings based on number of securities. The numbers are higher if based on market values.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The materiality assessment compared shifts in business mix (e.g. changes in line of business, industry and region mix), year on year, as well as any change in\n\nclimate scenarios that might result in a different outcome for the scenario analysis. It was concluded that there was no material change to the in-depth analysis of our underwriting portfolio. As such, the findings of the 2021 climate risk scenario analysis still stand.\n\n- - Focus for 2022 actions remain, as outlined in our 2021 report, with priority given to four areas:\n- - Retail and commercial motor.\n- - Property, including catastrophe management.\n- - Sustainable energy.\n- - Construction.\n\n## Materiality review of overall underwriting portfolio\n\nFollowing the detailed climate risk scenario assessment applied across the underwriting portfolio in 2021, we are taking the approach to update the full materiality assessment only in the event of a material change in either the underwriting portfolio or climate risk scenarios. For the purpose of this report, a material change in underwriting portfolio is defined as the change in industry or line of business mix of more than 5 percentage points for either the Group, or European P&C business and North America, independently.\n\nFrom 2020 (the basis of our climate risk scenario analysis) to 2021, there was no material shift in the P&C underwriting portfolio industry or line of business mix. The main driver of premium increase was increased rates, changing commodity prices and inflation, for example in costs of construction rather than an increase in exposure or coverage.\n\nOverall, the impact on demand for the current policies scenario would be immaterial to total P&C premiums. For the net-zero 2050 scenario, the impact of rate change in construction and property as well as a decline in premiums from the fossil fuel industry could drive increased upside opportunities. However, given the nature of rate change and commodity prices, we believe the impact would not be material when fully modeled.\n\nFor our Life business, an assessment of the 2021 Life portfolio showed a similar geographic mix to 2020. The most significant exposures are related to the life protection business in EMEA and LATAM (56 percent of protection gross written premiums). Corporate risk business continues to be well diversified across industry sectors. We therefore concluded that there was no material change to the risk profile of the Life business under the scenarios tested, compared with the previous assessment.\n\nOur conclusion, therefore, is that there is no material change in 2022 to the results of the 2021 climate risk scenario analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overall impacts to P&C demand at Group-level in 2030 under the scenarios previously modelled and with no change in assumptions are still estimated to be of low materiality.\n\nDemand impacts related to Life protection products are observed to be higher under the net-zero 2050 scenario. In both scenarios, impacts to Group-level P&C loss experience are observed to be more pronounced before mitigating actions are considered, due to the potential negative impact of physical losses related to weather events. In general, the diversification of our P&C business in terms of geographic footprint, industry mix and line of business limits our potential exposure at a total Group level. We would forgo growth opportunities highlighted in the current policies scenario as these derive from increased use of fossil fuels and are therefore not aligned with our net-zero commitments.\n\nBased on the outcome of our analysis on the Life and P&C book we do not expect material impacts to fee income received from Farmers Group Inc. through to 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.5 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis - Underwriting (continued)\n\nUnderwriting focus on building capabilities and continuing assessment on risks associated with both the transition and physical impact of climate change.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to prioritize areas of our portfolio identified during the climate risk scenario assessment 2021. We narrowed down the original nine areas of focus to four areas of markets and industries that are potentially the most material to our business, either due to the size of the underwriting portfolio or the potential impact of transition or physical risk on our portfolios.\n\nThese areas are:\n\n- - Retail and commercial motor.\n- - Property, including catastrophe management.\n- - Sustainable energy.\n- - Construction.\n\n## Retail and commercial motor: a closer look\n\nExpanded focus on technological advancements in driving and vehicles.\n\n## Identified action following climate risk scenario analysis 2021\n\nWe increased focus on monitoring loss trends associated with electric vehicles (EVs) to reflect this appropriately in pricing. Additionally, we are seeking to optimize claims networks for emerging technology and expanded focus on technological advancements in driving and vehicles.\n\n## Rationale\n\nTransition within the motor industry is largely focused on the shift from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to alternatively fuelled vehicles, mainly EVs. This shift to EVs goes hand in hand with the development and wide adoption of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in new vehicles.\n\nIn reviewing the impact of ADAS equipped vehicles, of which we identified EVs as a subset to ensure efficient analysis of both ADAS and EVs within the motor industry.\n\n## Progress\n\nWe established a global working group of subject matter experts to review relevant internal and external practices, for example, adjusting loss estimates or applying industry standard discounts for vehicles equipped with ADAS, formulate business goals, scan the market, conduct analyses and take action.\n\nThe work is ongoing. As of December 31, 2022, we have acquired external vehicle data for two of our key motor portfolios in EMEA. In-house experts are quantifying the predictive value of the data for underwriting to support the transition to a more resource-efficient and sustainable economy.\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nWe will continue our focus on e-mobility in four key areas:\n\n- 1 Portfolio (e.g., Zurich's market share, overall market growth and adoption of EVs in fleets).\n- 2  Pricing (e.g., discounts against ICE policies).\n- 3  Performance (e.g., claim frequency).\n- 4  Proposition (especially in high EV growth markets and segments).\n\n## Strategic action prioritized in 2022\n\nWe performed an in-depth review on claims experience with ADAS vehicles and will expand this to focus specifically on EVs during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Actions taken to counter this include a refined approach to managing natural catastrophe and optimizing exposure in key peril regions globally.\n\n## Identified action following climate risk scenario analysis 2021\n\nWe continued to develop our best-in-class catastrophe modeling and accumulation management, as well as focusing on building capabilities within Zurich Resilience Solutions, our risk management services unit. Please see section 5.1 for more information (page 174).\n\n## Rationale\n\nCatastrophe management is key to creating a climate resilient underwriting portfolio and also allows us to inform customers of actions they should take to become more resilient in the face of potential impact from climate change.\n\n## Outcome\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review, we prioritized action on capacity deployed within our North American business. We are on track to reduce U.S. windstorm average annual loss (AAL) by 10 percent by the end of 2023 and continue to take similar action in other regions.\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nOptimizing exposure in key peril regions remains a strong focus area and relies upon frequent, consistent and comprehensive review processes, which have been in place for many years and will continue to be a key part of our climate resilience strategy.\n\n## Energy transition: a closer look\n\nOur sustainable energy strategy underpins development of our energy book and helps support customers as they transition to lower-carbon operating models.\n\n## Identified action following climate risk scenario analysis 2021\n\n## Fossil fuels and power\n\nWays to support:\n\n- - We built a framework to help review customers' transition plans and look for ways to support them.\n- - We took action to grow our market share in renewables to maximise growth above that modeled. We continued to build on existing specialist knowledge to manage risk.\n\n## Strategic action prioritized in 2022\n\nThe future of energy depends on the transition of traditional power and fossil fuel companies to sustainable ways of generating power. During 2022 we restructured our team of experts, blending the old world of energy with the new to mirror our customers and better help them accelerate the energy transition. We have expanded our sustainable energy offering, developing skills internally as well as hiring industry experts where needed, and built further knowledge and expertise in this rapidly changing market.\n\nOur sustainable energy strategy is built on three layers:\n\n- - Engagement and review of transition plans.\n- - Upskilling and cross skilling in sustainable energy within underwriting, risk engineering and claims.\n- - Continued development of solutions to address emerging technologies in this area.\n\n## Strategic action prioritized in 2022\n\nWe assigned a dedicated project team, led by the global head of property, to oversee the management of exposures in key peril regions and further enhance Zurich's catastrophe management framework. We are building on existing capabilities within the area of catastrophe management and leveraging our in-house climate science experts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.5 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis - Underwriting (continued)\n\n## Outcome\n\nWe successfully grew our sustainable energy business in 2022. We operate across four hubs in the UK, U.S., Germany and Dubai, and service every industry within the area of sustainable energy, with the exception of offshore wind, which we are currently reviewing.\n\nOur integrated approach to energy allows us to access traditional power and fossil fuel customers that are transitioning to sustainable energy. The world's largest wind power owners, for example, are mostly traditional power companies or integrated energy companies. We estimate sustainable energy now represents more than 10 percent of our overall portfolio and we expect this share to grow rapidly. To enable this growth, our experts are working together to share knowledge. In 2022, for example, our sustainable energy global lead engineer and team created a detailed technical database of more than 1,800 wind turbines - a number that highlights both the demand for solutions and the complexity involved in understanding associated risks.\n\nWe developed and implemented our alignment, commitment, delivery and communication (ACDC) approach to reviewing transition plans (see below). As of December 31, 2022, we reviewed more than 30 companies using this approach and identified next steps to take to engage with the underwriting community and customer relationship leaders.\n\n## Transition assessment framework\n\n| Alignment     | - Aligned to Paris Agreement - Science-based targets in place or in progress                                  |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commitment    | - Short term plan to immediately decrease emissions - Evidence of capex allocation to fund transition actions |\n| Delivery      | - Demonstrate annual progress on targets ahead of renewal                                                     |\n| Communication | - Transparent disclosures                                                                                     |\n\n## Upskilling, cross skilling and recruitment\n\nIn 2022, we created the role of sustainable energy global lead engineer, which is pivotal for our understanding of the current risk landscape. In addition to this, we hired additional employees across underwriting, claims and risk engineering to help build our integrated approach to sustainable energy.\n\n## Developing solutions and growing the business\n\nOur global energy team created concepts for new products based on input from energy customers, through client meetings and at various conferences, for example, the Lillehammer Offshore Energy Claims Conference. We continue to work on bringing these solutions to market.\n\nTo drive and support growth in sustainable energy, the sustainable energy global lead engineer created an in-house equipment database to provide comprehensive details on the increasing amount of machinery coming to market in this area. He also represents Zurich on the Global Wind Energy Council. 1\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nWe continue to build the sustainable energy business across Zurich and are identifying new opportunities in emerging technology in this area. We expect to launch additional services throughout 2023.\n\nFigure 16\n\n<!-- image -->",

These policies offer customized coverage and market-leading capacity of up to USD 50 million for qualified risks using mass timber, a low-carbon alternative to concrete and steel. The product launch resulted in USD 1.85 million in new business.\n\nZurich construction in North America also launched a weather parametric product which provides non-physical damage coverage for perils including rain, wind, heat, cold and snow accumulation. We have seen interest from customers in the weather parametric product as a complement to builders risk insurance due to the continued uptick of severe weather events across North America. We continue to build out our peril offerings based on customer and broker needs.\n\nZurich construction in North America is a key pillar of our sustainable energy strategy, offering up to USD 100 million of capacity for qualified on-shore renewable energy risks, including wind, solar and biomass. Growing demand in the U.S. marketplace has accelerated due to various federal tax incentives and enhanced commitment from the government and population to renewable energy fuelled by uncertainty and supply chain challenges abroad.\n\nWe created the role of head of construction innovation and sustainability, which will be responsible for managing the growth of our parametric, mass timber and renewable energy products. This position will also be responsible for developing and deploying new sustainable product solutions for construction.\n\n## Strategic implications for overall underwriting portfolio\n\nWe have continued to focus on maximising opportunities and mitigating risks identified through the climate risk assessment 2021. We believe we are well positioned to further develop in these areas in 2023, whilst at the same time embedding net-zero underwriting across our business, in line with the NZIA's target setting protocol released in January 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This conclusion considers impacts across three major asset classes (listed equities, corporate credit and real estate) covering 36 percent of the investment portfolio, excludes the potential mitigating effect on liability valuation and is made in accordance with our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. 1 This methodology defines a major risk as a risk that could have a negative impact of at least USD 5 billion on the Group's economic capital position at either aggregate portfolio or individual asset class level.\n\nIn the current policies scenario, physical risk is limited over the time horizon of the analysis (2021-2050), with the exception of a few sectors and regions (e.g., agriculture and tropical regions) to which we have limited investment exposure in our listed equity, corporate credit and real estate portfolios.\n\nIn the net-zero 2050 scenario, the aggregate impact is also low. This is because transitioning is assumed to be relatively frictionless, without bottlenecks or supply side issues and businesses are assumed to be able to pass on cost increases to customers without negative impact. While some industries and businesses would experience a large negative impact on their market valuations in these scenarios, it would only generate limited aggregate risks.\n\nThe impact of climate risk on our sovereign debt exposure has been analyzed independently of other asset classes. The transition risk scenarios (net-zero 2050) are mildly inflationary due to a rising cost of carbon, resulting in slightly higher sovereign bond yields (by around 15 basis points for our investment sovereign bond portfolio) compared with the baseline. In the physical risk scenario (current policies), interest rates are slightly lower (by around 10 basis points) than the baseline due to a small negative effect on economic activity. The corresponding impact on the valuation of the sovereign debt portfolio is limited in all scenarios (less than 1.5 percent in the worst affected transition scenarios).\n\nGiven the scale of transformation required, an orderly and smooth transition, such as that described by the net-zero 2050 and delayed transition scenarios, may be difficult to achieve and periods of higher volatility are likely. There remains the potential for significant spill-over effects from the most affected sectors and regions, as well as a potentially positive - but possibly also disruptive - impact stemming from the development of new technology and gains in productivity. As the scenarios highlight, there will also be potentially large divergence across businesses and sectors, with the transition presenting both opportunities and risk.\n\n## Listed equities: a closer look\n\nWe applied the three scenarios and a third-party model to our global listed equity portfolio in comparison with a broad market benchmark, resulting in similar outcomes as in 2021. The relatively small changes in the overall impact on the value of our global listed equity portfolio (compared with the 2021 Annual Report) arise mainly from changes within the sectors of the portfolios.\n\nWe found transition risk to be material for businesses that operate in carbon-intensive sectors, have relatively high emissions and are less able to absorb, reduce or pass on carbon costs. The climate risk scenario analysis also sheds light on transition opportunities, including those that stem from greening the economy.\n\nIn contrast to transition risk, additional physical risk relative to today's level is estimated to be relatively limited over the time span considered, even in the current policies scenario. This is because it takes time for more significant, additional effects from climate change to materialize. More severe impact will therefore be restricted to a few regions and sectors, such as the agricultural sector and tropical regions, to which we have limited investment exposure across all asset classes. As shown on the next page, the largest relative impact on the valuation of our global listed equity portfolio is found in the net-zero 2050 scenario. The impact is somewhat higher than in the delayed transition scenario, due to the discounting of future impact and a heavily front-loaded, albeit gradual, rise in the price of carbon. From a financial materiality perspective, we observed only minor impacts to our listed equity portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result is not a reflection of the relative weighting of our book but captures the general impact on the economy, and consequently market pricing, in a transition risk scenario.\n\nBy contrast, services sectors, including healthcare and finance but also consumer and business services, see less impact. The relative resilience of services appears reasonable given their limited direct exposures, but there are a few caveats to this result. For the finance sector, only direct exposure to climate-related risk is considered. Indirect exposure through the valuation of assets and financial interlinkages is not captured. Additionally, if rapid transitioning were to lead to energy scarcity, bottlenecks in the economy and rising costs for energy and materials, this could impact sentiment and demand and have broader effects on the economy, including on the services sector.\n\n- 1 The sector heatmap is calibrated to highlight relative impact per industry sector.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.6 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis - Investment Management (continued)\n\nThe applied model highlights that an early-transition scenario can lead to transition opportunities and risks within industry sectors. Within the energy, utilities and non-energy materials sectors, which experience significant and negative median impacts, the characteristics of individual counterparties also have a strong impact on their exposure to climate risk. In the utilities sector, for example, some utilities experience significant decreases in value, as their high CO2e emissions intensity leaves them in a weak competitive position relative to less emission-intensive rivals, leading to reduced profitability and market share. Other utilities with lower emission intensity benefit from increased electricity demand, higher electricity prices and the opportunity to gain market share at the expense of more emission-intensive rivals. This variance in individual counterparty impacts also occurs in other sectors, including industrials and consumer cyclicals, where median impacts are small.\n\nOverall, the impacts on our global equity portfolio are somewhat smaller than those of a broad market benchmark. This is due to a number of different reasons, including differing sector weights and geographic exposure. Other contributing factors are a different security selection resulting from our long-standing practice of ESG integration as part of our responsible investment approach, as well as our climate-related exclusion screens. Since 2017, we have divested from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues from the mining of, or generate more than 30 percent of electricity from, thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale.\n\n## Corporate credit: a closer look\n\nApplying the various scenarios and third-party model to our global corporate credit portfolio in comparison with a broad market benchmark results in a similar distribution of outcomes as those for our listed equity portfolio. The portfolio tends to hold relatively lower risk than the benchmark.\n\nTransition risk is found to be moderate for businesses that operate in carbon-intensive sectors, have relatively high emissions and are less able to absorb, reduce or pass on carbon costs and physical risk. In the physical risk scenario (current policies), the impact is relatively low across all sectors.\n\nFor the most affected sectors, the materially lower impact on corporate credit relative to equity can be explained by the relatively short maturity of the corporate bond portfolio. These bonds tend to experience smaller impacts simply because they mature before the strongest impacts materialize. Risk associated with the refinancing of debt is not considered in the current modeling approach.\n\nIn contrast to the listed equity portfolio, the corporate debt portfolio shows a higher diversification and lower exposure to carbon-intensive sectors, and hence has a lower exposure to sectors impacted by climate risk.\n\nWhile the overall impact of climate risk on our corporate bond portfolio, based on the third-party model we applied, is fairly limited, we nevertheless consider it prudent to take strategic actions as detailed in the section covering our strategic implications on page 150.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is confirmed by additional analyses using Zurich's own physical risk models, which cover wind (U.S. tropical cyclone and EU extra-tropical cyclone) and flood (pluvial and fluvial for U.S. und EU) and comprise more than 80 percent of our real estate investments. Zurich's physical risk models will be developed further in 2023 and applied to all real estate investments. As communicated last year, we piloted transition risk assessments by implementing the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) 2 methodology. The ability to use CRREM on a dedicated carbon management platform allows us to monitor, report and mitigate transition risks.\n\nMore than 80 percent of our real estate investments are in Europe, with an overweight in Switzerland and Germany. Under different climate scenarios, our portfolio is most exposed to rising temperatures in southern Europe. More tenants will rely on electricity to run fans, ventilation and air conditioning systems to stay cool. Retrofitting and constructing smarter and more energy-efficient buildings is therefore a first step to mitigate electricity shortage and higher costs in our properties in Spain, Portugal and Italy.\n\n- 1 The sector heatmap is calibrated to highlight relative impact per industry sector.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.6 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis - Investment Management (continued)\n\nAs an example of ongoing mitigation efforts, in Milan, Italy, we are repositioning a building with 11,000 square meters through renovation. The building is currently undergoing a renovation phase with the aim to receive a gold-level certification from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The renovation includes modifying part of the envelope and replacing the existing mechanical system to improve performance and efficiency and bring the building in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Carbon intensity can be reduced by more than 50 percent, significantly reducing the risk of stranding this asset.\n\nRecent research 1 has also found that prime office and residential sectors are most exposed to urban heat islands. The most exposed country to a rise in sea levels is the Netherlands.\n\nOur main focus is the rapid decarbonization of our Swiss portfolio, which still uses mostly oil and gas for heating and producing warm water in residential buildings. To transform this portfolio, we have initiated several strategic investment programs to achieve our 2025 emission reduction target. In addition, we are continuing with our energy optimization project in Switzerland. The project, which started in 2014, has already led to a reduction in carbon emissions of more than 20 percent, compared with our 2010 baseline.\n\n## Materiality review of overall investment management portfolio\n\nOverall, the applied model suggests a manageable level of risk across all scenarios and results in a valuation impact of minor materiality accumulated for listed equity, corporate credit and real estate. The applied model identifies relatively more material risk for exposed sectors where these risks are relatively well understood and an increasing body of climate risk-related ESG research provides ongoing insights. We also believe that an early transition to a climate-neutral economy may provide opportunities in a wider variety of business models and industry sectors than the applied model assumes. Our portfolio continues to be well diversified across sectors and geographies and is managed with an ESG integration lens, which includes information about both climate change risks and opportunities.\n\nOur portfolio is also managed to become net-zero by 2050, with the progressing decarbonization successively shielding it from the companies that are lagging in the transition. The analysis supports various hypotheses: earlieraction scenarios materially increase transition risks, but in turn reduce the long-term impacts of physical risks. Even in a challenging transition risk scenario, the overall negative effect on the listed equity portfolio is moderate and concentrated in sectors that are most CO2e-emission intensive but also play the largest role in actively driving the transition. Emissions in the economy are disproportionally concentrated in a few sectors (utilities, energy, materials, agriculture, forestry and land use) and so, too, are financed emissions in a global equity portfolio. In our listed equity portfolio, 62 percent of financed emissions in the top emitting sectors (building materials, energy, chemicals and utilities) represent only 12 percent of market value as of 2021. However, in-depth analysis of sectors shows that there are also investment opportunities in these sectors, such as renewable energy producers in utilities.\n\nOverall, the risk appears well diversified, though the portfolio requires ongoing monitoring and active management as risks materialize.\n\n## Strategic implications for overall investment management portfolio\n\nOur strategic response to carbon risks is our long-term commitment to decarbonize our investment portfolio to netzero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u02daC above pre-industrial temperatures. As a founding member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), we have set intermediate investment portfolio targets. The work of the NZAOA is collaborative, uniting global investors, civil society leaders and academics in a collective ambition.\n\n## Our priorities include:\n\n- - Reducing exposure to coal-based business models.\n- - Enhancing our systematic approach to investee engagement and policy advocacy.\n- - Implementing the TCFD recommendations.\n\nWhile increasing the resilience of our portfolio against transition risks, our decarbonization strategy also contributes to limiting the physical risks showcased in the current policies scenario, which may materialize in our portfolio over the long term. Moreover, our new commitment to invest 5 percent of Group total investments in impact investments, including climate solution investments, 2 further underpins our efforts to minimize the long-term impacts of climate change by focusing on proactively deploying capital toward addressing specific, measurable societal and environmental goals.\n\n- 2  Assets that provide climate solutions are businesses that drive or underpin substantial reductions in, or the removal of, greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These impacts, on a global scale, resemble climate patterns that already exist today.\n\nExisting business resilience activities were determined to manage physical risks well. These activities focus on protecting and recovering critical business assets and resources of a wide-range of existing and developing risks, including those related to the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn 2022, we determined the outputs from the 2021 assessment remain valid and conducted an additional assessment to consider climate risks for our distributed workforce. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations, including Zurich, have adapted their working practices to keep their employees safe, most notably through increased working from home.\n\nPlanning for the continuity of critical business services with a hybrid workforce has, in some ways, increased resilience by adopting more remote work practices. But in other ways, this has added to complexity, given the limited control businesses have over dispersed work locations.\n\nOur analysis of potential climate impacts to our distributed workforce considers the following:\n\n- - The incident impacts employee homes but the office remains accessible (e.g., localised flooding in an area where a number of employees live).\n- - The incident impacts both the homes of the employees and access to the office locations (e.g., rolling power outages across an extended region).\n\nTo develop new strategies and assess the potential effectiveness of our existing strategies, we assume the following as part of our analysis:\n\n- - Most of our employees live within a 70 kilometer radius of a Zurich office location.\n- - Hybrid working since the COVID-19 pandemic remains the preferred working option with most employees retaining the ability to work from home and in an office.\n- - The geographic separation provided by this hybrid working model is already a mitigating measure as an event would need to be widescale to impact all employees.\n- - Most employees are not wholly reliant on public transport.\n\nOur analysis indicates the in-force remediating strategies are suitable, though the evolution of certain perils in certain areas may require the installation of mobile electricity generators in office locations to maintain use of hard- and software in the event of power disruptions.\n\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring of climate risk, we considered the changing nature of our supplier landscape which can lead to changes in our physical risk profile. No material changes were observed. Overall, the existing processes remain sufficient to manage risk exposure.\n\nOngoing activities related to enhancing our resilience capabilities and improving our third-party governance and oversight will continue to support us in identifying and responding to the ongoing impacts of climate change.\n\nTransition risk exposure is limited given the low-carbon intensity of the operations of the insurance sector and our approach to continuously improve the way we manage operational sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\n## 4.1.8 Further climate risk scenario analysis\n\nOur climate risk assessment includes consideration of both litigation and reputational risks.\n\nLitigation risk: Though not a focus of our scenario analysis, some current litigation drivers were considered in specific areas of our in-depth analysis. None were identified as a material risk driver in the medium term. We closely monitor developments potentially impacting litigation-related risks and take actions to address them proactively.\n\nReputational risk : Given our ambitions to address the impacts of climate change, we acknowledge we are under higher public scrutiny and any perceived or real failure to live up to our set objectives and targets could have a particularly significant impact on our reputation. To reduce the risk of failing to deliver our targets, we put controls in place and monitor progress through the governance structures described in Chapter 3 of the integrated sustainability disclosure (see pages 129 to 130).\n\nWe believe strong internal focus on delivery, coupled with public disclosure on progress, mitigates this risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.9 Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis - conclusion\n\nOur initial scenario-based climate risk assessment has strengthened our understanding of the potential impacts of climate risk on our business. The assessment suggests our customer-focused approach and diversified portfolios, supported by strong risk management practices, provide the resilience and flexibility necessary to be able to adapt to the impacts observed. This has been confirmed by our monitoring of these risks throughout 2022, though we have identified specific areas for further action, mainly in our underwriting and operations. The additional assessments of asset classes in investment management confirms the resilience of our portfolio.\n\nHighly carbon-intensive pockets of our insurance and proprietary investment portfolios experience elevated exposure to transition risk, however we believe our in force thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale exclusion policy allows us to address this exposure whilst aligning with our commitment to a low-carbon future. The adaptive nature of our business resilience program means processes will adapt to changing physical risk profiles ensuring operational resilience.\n\nWe caveat these conclusions by acknowledging the hypothetical nature of these scenarios, the uncertainty inherent in scenario modeling over the timeframes considered and the somewhat conservative modeling of physical and transition risk. As the effects of climate change gradually increase over the coming decades, adaptation efforts at the individual, company and state level will increase and provide resilience against expected impacts. This is likely to reduce societal and economic losses, however the details heavily depend on uncertain societal and technological developments. On the other hand, exceeding tipping points, such as accelerated melting of Antarctic ice sheets or permafrost thawing, could lead to large-scale discontinuities in the global climate systems and accelerate the impacts from physical climate risk. We believe our strategy of continually analyzing changing risk profiles and retaining customer focus gives us the flexibility required to maintain our resilience and continue to meet the needs of our customers as climate-related risk profiles evolve.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\nPeter Giger Group Chief Risk Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nAs outlined in the governance section of the ISD (see pages 129 to 130), sustainability, and, therefore, climate-related topics, are integrated into our existing governance structure. We ensure climate change is discussed with our Board and committees where and when required. In 2022, climate risk was discussed at committee and Board level in relation to the update of the Group's Sustainability framework, sustainability reporting in addition to the regular bi-annual update to the GNSC (including a detailed session on the scenario-based climate risk assessment of Underwriting) and more specific climate risk updates (including climate risk within specific regions). Outcomes of scenario-based climate risk assessments and monitoring are considered as part of strategy setting processes. Further information on sustainability risk and its governance is set out in the risk review (see pages 198 to 229).\n\n## 4.3 Risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The processes used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks.\n\n## 4.3.1 Integration of climate risk within the overall risk management framework\n\nWe consider impacts from climate change to be drivers for other risks, such as market or natural catastrophe risks, which are managed within our existing risk management framework. Our approach to managing climate risk is embedded in our multi-disciplinary, Group-wide risk management framework, following the same objectives of informed and disciplined risk taking. The risk management framework is based on a governance process that sets forth clear responsibilities for taking, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. These responsibilities are:\n\n- - To identify, assess, manage, monitor and report risks, including climate change, that can have an impact on the achievement of our strategic objectives, the Group applies a proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. This medium- to long-term (typically one to three years) assessment considers our planning horizon and allows us to classify risks according to their materiality based on the estimated severity and the likelihood of the risk materializing. Further, it supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n- - To take the longer-term nature of climate change into account, we complement our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology with portfolio-level scenario analysis of climate risk. This provides an outlook on much longer-term risk developments (up to 10 years and even out to 30 years) relevant to our underwriting and investment portfolios, as outlined in the strategy section (see pages 132 to 153). The details of our risk management framework are outlined in the risk review (see pages 198 to 229).\n\n## 4.3.2 Managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes\n\nAs outlined in the strategy section (see pages 132 to 153), changes in physical risks related to much longer-term 1 impacts of climate change could, over time, impact us through the property-related business via changes in severity and probability of climate-related natural catastrophes. This is, in part, mitigated by the flexible nature of our underwriting portfolio, with contracts that are typically renewed annually. We recognize that there are shorter-term physical risks related to climate change, such as a rise in sea levels, but the science indicates that the greatest changes in physical risks related to climate change will occur over the much longer-term. We have established sophisticated natural catastrophe modeling capabilities to manage our underwriting selection, ensuring accumulations stay within intended exposure limits and assessing the capital requirement due to natural catastrophes. The resulting view of natural catastrophe risk also underpins profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocation and guides the type and quantity of reinsurance we buy. To ensure global consistency, natural catastrophe exposures are modeled in the Group Risk Management function.\n\nThird-party models provide a starting point for the assessment of natural catastrophe risk. However, they are generally built for the market average and need validation and adjustment by specialized teams to reflect the best view of risk. We have been a leader in natural catastrophe model validation since 2005 when we developed our proprietary 'Zurich View' of risk. This gives us nearly two decades of experience in applying a structured and quantitative approach to optimize our risk view. To arrive at the Zurich View, models are adjusted in terms of frequency, severity and event uncertainty.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.3.2 Managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes (continued)\n\nAdjustment factors address potential losses from non-modeled, property-related exposures or secondary perils to the extent not covered by the third-party models. Every catastrophe event provides an opportunity to learn from our own claims experience and the modeling framework provides a place to capture the new insights. We constantly review and expand the scope and sophistication of our modeling and strive to improve data quality by leveraging technology.\n\nWe supplement internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes). We are a shareholder in PERILS AG, Switzerland, a catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm. We are also a member of the open-source initiative Oasis Loss Modeling Framework.\n\nCatastrophe models based on historical data do not capture potential, much longer-term shifts of extreme weather events related to climate change. However, when combined with general circulation models (GCMs), which build representations of the Earth's physical climate systems, catastrophe models can help us understand the risk of future climate conditions. The quality of GCMs continues to evolve as scientific understanding of the Earth's climate systems increases and as progress is made in computing power and artificial intelligence. This science is evolving, and we have strengthened our catastrophe modeling team with dedicated resources to create methodologies to integrate forwardlooking aspects into our modeling approach.\n\n## 4.3.3 Portfolio-level, scenario-based climate risk assessment\n\nAssessments of the resilience of our business model to potential climate risks over much longer periods of time are performed using scenario analysis. To ensure a consistent Group view on potential climate change pathways, scenarios selected for this analysis underpin all assessments Group wide, unless other local regulatory requirements exist. Assessment granularity and timeframes can be tailored to the specific requirements of the assessment. In line with established governance, the ExCo sponsor for Sustainability reviews the outcomes of the climate change scenario analysis, reports key outcomes and agrees actions with the ExCo for Group CEO approval.\n\nThe ExCo sponsor for Sustainability reports outcomes and actions to the Board's Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee (GNSC). The GNSC makes recommendations to the Board, as required. An integrated modeling approach, leveraging a third-party model, is adopted for the analysis of our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios to ensure, as much as possible, the consistent use of assumptions. To quantify impacts on Group assets, the model adopts a bottom-up approach to analyze the exposures of businesses and industries to physical and transition risk. To provide a map of vulnerabilities, it uses asset-level data on relevant risk drivers, including carbon emissions, abatement options, exposure to physical risks (including location-based exposure to acute physical risks), exposure to the greening of the economy, dependency on fossil fuels and competitiveness.\n\nThe strength of this bottom-up approach is that it provides a coherent framework for analyzing climate change-related risk at the industry and corporate sector level. Given the flexibility of our business model, in both our underwriting and asset portfolios, the static balance sheet approach to scenario-based climate risk assessments is done in the full recognition that the analysis is a theoretical 'what if' analysis. It is a useful analysis to stretch management thinking about the much longer-term outlook and to address consistency of disclosures expected through the TCFD framework, but it does not provide insights from an immediate solvency, financial or capacity management perspective.\n\nData underpinning the assessment of impacts on group assets are used in conjunction with premium and loss data to model impacts on our insurance business in a bespoke process.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This implies quantified impacts assume no strategic reaction from us to the risks identified, and no movements in pricing to adapt to changing conditions.\n- - Zurich performed scenario analysis for underwriting using a monitoring review based on 2021 premium data and qualitative review of the scenario-based assumptions on sector growth trends. Scenario analysis for investment management has been performed using year-end 2021 financial data with latest available emissions data (mostly 2020). For our own operations, internal physical risk analysis of proprietary and third-party data was used.\n- - Modeled impacts of acute physical risks on expected losses are, to every extent possible, based on our own natural catastrophe modeling. We work with a third-party model which enables us to search publicly available hazard data by type of hazard. We will expand our in-house modeling to cover all types of physical risks and this will be included in our own catastrophe modeling results.\n- - While the bottom-up approach adopted by the underlying model facilitates granular analysis of climate changerelated risk, the model displays characteristics that present a somewhat conservative view of impacts, namely:\n- -  The assumption of smooth transitioning, as capital moves from carbon-intensive to low-carbon activities without bottlenecks or frictions (e.g., costs are passed to consumers), leads to a muted 'cost of transition', despite a very steep rise in the price of carbon (toward USD 700 per metric tons CO2e).\n- - The assumption of perfect information, where action is only taken once new policies are in place, omits an important uncertainty effect.\n- -  Modeling of physical risk considers three acute hazards (coastal flood, inland flood and tropical cyclones), is location based and does not consider supply chain impacts. This means aggregate estimates of physical risk are somewhat limited. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on our risk management process and supporting committees: see the risk review on pages 198 to 229.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- -  Assess impact on underwriting volumes of key sectors, lines of business and geographies due to climate risks in 2030 (relative to the baseline scenario)\n\n## Method\n\n- -Impact on demand due to change in climate-related exposure\n- -Impact on expected losses arising from transition and physical risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conduct portfolio-level risk assessment\n\n## Objectives\n\n- -  Identify key risks and opportunities (for risk management framework and disclosure)\n- -Quantification of portfolio-level impact on underwriting volumes\n\n## Method\n\n- -  Building on analysis in steps one and two, quantify impacts on underwriting volumes in 2030 (relative to baseline) due to climate risks",

Referring to the agreed methodology to measure insurance-associated emissions, published by\n\nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) in November 2022, we have already started to set a baseline using our underwriting portfolio. We are working through the protocols for target setting announced in January by the NZIA to develop our interim targets and reporting thereof.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revenues from energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies 2\n\nOur products related to energy efficiency and low-carbon technology, separately priced, amount to USD 155 million of gross written premiums and policy fees in 2022 (USD 121 million in 2021). This is driven mainly by an increase in the number of customers shifting from ICE to EV products across the\n\nmarket. Coupled with the first reporting in 2022 of the approved individual coverage to more exposed individuals solution in occupational accident for truckers and independent service providers.\n\nFor more information on all our sustainable solutions, please see section 5.1.1 pages 171 to 174.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting and Investment Management\n\n## Thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale\n\nOur thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale engagement campaign officially ended after a two-year period in June 2021. 3 Fifty-five companies were placed on an engagement status of 'ongoing,' as their transition plans require monitoring. Out of these 55 companies, and as of the 2021 reporting cut off, we did the following to understand their progress against their transition plans:\n\n- - Added 5 companies to our exclusion screen as we no longer consider the company's progress against its stated transition plans to be credible.\n- - Cleared 10 companies, as they were no longer relevant for our policy, due to their decreasing thermal coal businesses.\n- - For an additional 10 companies the business relationships ended for reasons unrelated to our policy.\n- - Began monitoring the remaining 30 companies. Though these companies meet the thresholds of our policy, we have elected to maintain ongoing monitoring as they have not explicitly ruled out future increases in use of thermal coal or oil sands. We are now targeting some of these companies under our net-zero engagement campaign.\n\nIn line with our thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale policy, we continue to screen new investments and potential customers for involvement in policy-relevant activities. We will not insure or invest in companies that exceed our thresholds and do not have near-term commitments in place to bring themselves below these limits.\n\n- 1 Cover-More, Farmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and third party vendors are out of scope.\n- 2  Revenues capture gross written premiums and policy fees.\n- 3  www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/sustainability-risk\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.4.2 Our performance metrics (continued)\n\nIn 2022, we advanced our bilateral net-zero engagement campaign (as illustrated above in table 4). We focused on companies with heavy emissions to understand the company's current emission intensity and their transition plans. In cases where the company has not yet established such a plan, Zurich will work with the company to set up a transition plan.\n\n## Case study\n\nSince 2019, underwriting and investment management have worked together to continuously engage with a customer and investee company that was one of the highest CO2e emitters in both our underwriting and investment management portfolios, mainly due to its coal-fired power generation. At the start of engagement, the company indicated its willingness to transition with a clear plan to switch to renewable energy. Annual meetings supported the continued exchange between Zurich, the customer and investee company and provided evidence that the company was indeed on a science-based reduction pathway as part of its sustainability efforts. The company committed to invest EUR 50 billion by 2030, doubling its installed capacity from renewable energy to 50 gigawatts, making them one of the largest players in the renewable energy market.\n\nIn addition to direct company engagement, we also participated in working groups supporting sector and asset manager engagement, bilaterally and as part of the NZAOA asset manager workstream. We contributed to an NZAOA paper outlining how asset owners can engage their asset managers on climate change lobbying. The paper will provide guidelines for the investor community to help them drive greater alignment between the systemic long-term interests of asset owners and the policy engagement and public discourse practices undertaken by Alliance members and their asset managers.\n\nWe also engage with our asset managers (individually and as part of the AOA) on topics related to climate change.\n\nThese can include:\n\n- - Asking asset managers to set their own science-based targets.\n- - Joining the Net-Zero Asset Manager initiative.\n- - Becoming a signatory to CA100+.\n- - Making sure asset managers' active ownership policies (proxy voting and engagement) are suitable for managing climate transition risks and are conducive to climate change mitigation and the transition to a climate-neutral economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Please note that parentheses around percentages or points indicate a reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nIn 2021, we set intermediate targets for 2025 following the guidance of the AOA for the asset classes of listed equity, corporate bonds and real estate. Since the announcement, we have been working on local objective setting, implementation and\n\ndata improvements. We have broken down the global portfolio target by local business unit and region. This allows us to capture factors such as local market considerations, sector diversification and past and projected pathways of emissions.\n\nWe strongly believe that simply divesting from companies with carbon-intense footprints is less effective than engaging with them to drive the shift to sustainable practices. The findings from our engagement efforts, as described above, will help guide us through portfolio construction and rebalancing actions, benchmark changes and, where relevant and as a last resort, divestments. We aim to reach our targets by phasing out exposures to already restricted names under our thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale policy. Our restricted equity exposure has been divested by the end of 2021 across all local entities (monitored and reviewed periodically), while our corporate credit was either sold or the securities allowed to mature. We are taking portfolio construction actions that allow for potential switches of issuers with a lower CO2e footprint and potential divestments for those cases where no valid transition plans are in place and hence where engagement fails.\n\n## Assets under Management: corporate portfolio 1\n\nTable 5\n\n|                              | In scope   AuM 2022  (USDbn)   | In scope   AuM 2019  (baseline)   (USDbn)   | Difference   (2022 to  baseline)   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Zurich corporate portfolio   | 47.7                           | 58.5                                        | (19%)                              |\n| By investment asset class  2 |                                |                                             |                                    |\n| Listed equity                | 6.4                            | 10.6                                        | (39%)                              |\n| Corporate bonds              | 41.2                           | 47.9                                        | (14%)                              |\n| By region                    |                                |                                             |                                    |\n| APAC                         | 5.0                            | 4.5                                         | 12%                                |\n| EMEA                         | 29.5                           | 38.2                                        | (23%)                              |\n| Americas                     | 13.2                           | 15.9                                        | (17%)                              |\n| By sector                    |                                |                                             |                                    |\n| Utilities                    | 4.0                            | 4.4                                         | (9%)                               |\n| Government-owned company     | 1.7                            | 2.7                                         | (37%)                              |\n| Energy                       | 1.9                            | 2.1                                         | (13%)                              |\n\n- 1 AuM covers companies: listed equities and listed croporate credit.\n- 2   Corporate portfolio has been newly split by listed equity and corporate bond.

equities and listed corporate credit) attributed with enterprise value methodology and matched based on most recently available emission data.\n- 3   Emission reporting for Zurich-validated green bonds in the Utility and Energy sectors was refined in 2022 to reflect the nature of the financed projects. Please see the green bond validation methodology in our white paper www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-at-zurich\n\nSince 2019, we have achieved a reduction in the emission intensity of -12 percent. Zurich's absolute financed emissions declined over the same period by -29 percent. This reduction in financed emissions was mainly driven by i) disposals and changes in our portfolio and ii) structural emission reductions of our investee companies. We observe a meaningful drop in emissions from companies in run-off under the coal/oil sands policy due to maturing assets but also active portfolio management.\n\nThe reduction of 2020 emissions benefited from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the largest-ever decline in global emissions. With economic activities picking up again in 2021 global CO2e emissions have rebounded. 1 As per our methodology, we use the latest available corporate emission data as of January, when portfolio-level financed emissions are calculated on an annual basis. Hence, we see the effect of higher reported emissions from companies, compared with the emissions data available last year, to calculate the financed emissions per year end. Despite this reversing effect, we still see a reduction of emissions from issuers.\n\nHowever, the large financial market correction experienced in 2022 caused a percentage-decline in the enterprise values of our investee companies, which exceeded the noted decline in financed emissions. This larger drop in enterprise value adversely impacted our financed emission intensity metric, which uses enterprise value as the denominator. For further details on our methodology, please see the box on page 165.\n\nPrevious years have demonstrated the need to consider both absolute and relative indicators when measuring the emission performance of portfolios. Relative indicators are sensitive to changes in company valuation, whereas absolute emissions are sensitive to strategic shifts in asset allocation. In the long run, it remains our view that alignment with the NZAOA methodology will provide us with a stable and robust metric describing the trajectory our emission reduction pathway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In cases where the data is available or properties use onsite/offsite renewable energies, the market-based methodology is applied.\n- 2   The emission factors are retrieved from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020) with exception of Switzerland for local calculation references (Intep, REIDA 2022 and local authorities) which are aligned with IEA.\n- 3   The relative emissions intensity is calculated based on gross floor area (GFA) of the buildings.\n- 4   Real estate emissions are only available with a four-quarter lag. Emissions in 2022 will be reported in the 2023 report. Includes investment portfolio buildings only, as own-use buildings are part of our operational emissions target.\n- 5   Direct real estate holdings form the base for the emission reduction targets. There are no applicable figures for the APAC region available.\n\nFor our direct real estate portfolio, we are aiming to reduce our relative emission intensity by 30 percent by 2025, from a 2019 baseline. Our target includes scope 1 and 2 emissions, the so called 'operational emissions.' 1 Since 2019, we have reduced our carbon emissions by 20 percent and are progressing well toward our 2025 target.\n\nOur carbon emissions have decreased by 15.7 percent compared with the results in 2020, even as occupancy levels increased in our buildings due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The decrease was largely due to a higher share of green electricity, which has tripled since 2019, in line with our strategy. We achieved further reductions through energy efficiency initiatives and refurbishment projects.\n\n- 1 Scope 1 emissions, also known as direct emissions, are defined as emissions from sources that exist 'on site' of an asset. These include primarily emissions from onsite heating systems. A common example of Scope 1 emissions for real estate is natural gas and oil burned onsite. Scope 2 emissions are defined as emissions that are related to purchased electricity, heat, steam or cooling. This energy is consumed by the assets but generated offsite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The targets cover the following:\n\n- - Thirty-six percent of our assets under management in the baseline year of 2019.\n\nWe chose to calculate corporate-financed emissions and the resulting relative emissions intensity using the protocol's preferred approach, which is based on enterprise value, not revenue.\n\nWhile a revenue-based carbon intensity measure is a good way to compare companies based on their size and underlying technology, NZAOA members believe the enterprise value approach is a better way to convert a corporation's operational emissions (scope 1+2) into the 'financed emissions.' This can be attributed to a company's underlying equity and/or debt investors, who are ready to take additional responsibility for these emissions. To calculate corporate financed emissions, we use the following methodology:\n\n- - Scope 1+2 emissions in line with the GHG protocol are provided by S&P Trucost.\n- - Enterprise value is defined as the sum of market capitalization of common stock at fiscal year end, the market capitalization of preferred equity at fiscal year end, and the book values of debt and minorities' interests minus the cash and cash equivalents held by the enterprise. When enterprise value is not available (for example for financial companies) it is substituted with market capitalization. Enterprise value data is provided by S&P Trucost.\n\nMarket value is defined as the market value of listed equities and listed corporate debt at fiscal year end.\n\nWhile all financial data (enterprise value and market value) is calculated as of December 31 of the reporting year, we use the latest available corporate emission data available as of January each year, when portfoliolevel financed emissions are calculated on an annual basis. This means that emissions data is systematically lagging. For example, financed emissions for 2022 will be largely based on full-year 2021 emissions data, as full-year 2022 emissions data will only be made available by investees in H1 2024, and tends to flow to data providers via CDP submissions in the fourth quarter of a given year.\n\nTo increase transparency and improve the quality of our portfolio, we are aiming to increase the share of green certified buildings in our global real estate portfolio to 30 percent by 2025. We are also working on enhancing the completeness of our data and reported a coverage ratio 1 of 65 percent for 2021.\n\n## Green certified buildings 1\n\nTable 10\n\n|                                        | % green certified buildings 2022   | % green certified buildings  2021   | % green certified buildings  2020   | % green certified buildings  2019   | Target  2025   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Zurich Global Real Estate Portfolio  1 | 25%                                | 19%                                 | 22%                                 | 25%                                 | 30%            |\n| APAC                                   | 0%                                 | -                                   | -                                   | -                                   |                |\n| EMEA                                   | 27%                                | 20%                                 | 23%                                 | 28%                                 |                |\n| Americas                               | 17%                                | 19%                                 | 18%                                 | 17%                                 |                |\n\n- 1     Market-value weighted and based on balance sheet investments, incl. buildings used by Zurich.\n\nAs a founding member of the NZAOA, we apply the NZAOA methodology to listed equity, corporate bonds and direct real estate.

These are solutions that reduce greenhouse gases by avoiding emissions and/or by sequestering carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. Further examples\n\nof solutions include investments in climate change adaptation that contribute to enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.\n\n- 1 The coverage ratio is the gross floor area (GFA) in square meters (m 2 ) of completed properties for which data is collected as a percentage of the total GFA area in m 2 of all completed properties in the portfolio.\n\nI\n\n- 1.

Our strategy is based on three pillars:\n\n- -ESG integration: integrate ESG factors into the investment process - across asset classes and alongside traditional financial metrics while generating superior risk-adjusted, long-term financial returns.\n- -Impact investing: build an impact investing portfolio that makes a positive contribution to the environment and society, to improve the lives of 5 million people and to help avoid the emission of 5 million metric tons of CO2e per year.\n- -Advancing together: make responsible investment mainstream through collaborative engagement with other industry participants and engaging with policy makers to build markets in which ESG risk is priced efficiently and decarbonization is incentivized.\n\nIn 2022, we committed to allocating 5 percent of our proprietary assets to impact investments by 2025. Zurich evaluates impact investments within the context of specific asset classes and creates dedicated strategies for impact investments for each class. We continue to grow our existing global impact investment portfolio and evaluate new prospective opportunities across asset classes to broaden our approach.\n\n## Investment portfolio managed by responsible investors\n\n|                                            | 2022    | 2021    | Change   | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Assets managed by  responsible investor  1 | 99.6%   | 99.6%   | 0pts     | 99.6%   | 98.2%   | 97.5%   |\n| Total amount of impact  investments        |         |         |          |         |         |         |\n| (USD millions)                             | 6,328   | 7,037   | (10%)    | 5,770   | 4,555   | 3,790   |\n| % of investment portfolio                  | 3.8%    | 3.3%    | 13ppts   | 2.5%    | 2.2%    | 1.9%    |\n| Investment portfolio (USD  millions)  2    | 168,478 | 211,334 | (20%)    | 226,389 | 204,803 | 195,472 |\n\n- 1 A United Nations supported PRI signatory or asset manager that fulfills our minimum requirements for ESG integration.\n- Please see our responsible investment white paper:   www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-at-zurich\n- 2   Investment portfolio is calculated on a market basis, and is different from the total Group investments reported in the consolidated financial statements, which is calculated on an accounting basis and doesn't include cash and cash equivalents.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For our in-house asset management, we ensure that outcomes of engagements are linked to the proxy voting process to form a consistent active-ownership approach. This means that where engagement as part of our net-zero program fails and companies refuse to set targets after due dialogue, we will vote against board members at shareholder meetings.\n\nProxy voting 2022\n\n## Our voting activities in 2022\n\n## Our voting behavior in 2022\n\nFigure 23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVotes cast\n\n85%\n\nNo votes cast\n\n15%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVoted with management\n\n72%\n\nVoted against management\n\n13%\n\nNo votes cast\n\n15%\n\nIn 2022, we voted 85 percent of our in-scope equity. Close to 80 percent of our equity investments are in scope for proxy voting, please see proxy voting policy for further details. The share of voted equity remains stable when compared to 2021, reflecting last year's successful full roll out of proxy voting to Zurich's externally managed equity portfolios. We measure the votes we cast based on assets under management. Reasons for votes not cast are a combination of portfolio turnover, cost/benefit considerations and voting restrictions (such as demands to vote in person, share blocking or requirements that increase the cost of voting).\n\n## Impact investing\n\nImpact investments are investment opportunities that allow us to intentionally target a specific and measurable social or environmental impact. Zurich has set a target to help avoid 5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year, and, separately, make a positive contribution to the lives and livelihoods of 5 million people through its impact investing portfolio. We also committed to investing 5 percent of our proprietary investment portfolio to impact investments by 2025, which will help grow our allocation to climate solutions and investments benefiting society.\n\nWe are proud that our impact investment approach won three awards in 2022, recognizing our thought leadership as institutional investor in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, our impact investing portfolio of USD 6.3 billion helped avoid a total of 3.2 million metric tons of CO2e emissions and benefited 4.7 million people. 1\n\n- 1 Please see www.zurich.com/sustainability/customers/investing-responsibly/impact-investment for more details on impact investing approach.

Supporting collaborative initiatives and working together with other industry participants to advance responsible investment practices forms an integral part of our approach. We have signed the UN-backed PRI as well as the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and collaborate with several industry initiatives and research bodies. Most notably, we are a founding member of the NZAOA, as well as the Investor's Leaders Group (ILG), facilitated by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. We co-chaired the Executive Committee of the Green and Social Bond Principles for the first six years after its formation and represent asset owners on the Advisory Board of the Operating Principles for Impact Management. In 2022, we actively participated in 20 membership organizations.

Therefore the 2021 results also include restated 2019 and 2020 data.\n\nFor details please see: www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/net-zero-in-operations\n\nIn 2021, carbon emissions have continued on a downward trend, extending our overperformance against future targets. This is largely due to the full-year impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns and travel bans. Commuting emissions are the largest source of emissions for Zurich. Commuting data was collected from an all employee global survey conducted in 2020, to understand 2019 commuting behavior. As employees continue to work partly from home, we have once again applied assumptions to the 2019 results. An additional survey was not warranted. Air travel, as the second-largest contributor to Zurich's emissions, has shown real reductions of 91 percent. With our ambition to keep air travel 70 percent below pre-pandemic levels, we intend to maintain the majority of these real reductions in 2022 and onwards even as restrictions on travel from the pandemic are lifted. Fleet emissions declined compared with 2019, in line with a reduction in overall distances travelled and due in part to the transition to more sustainable vehicles.\n\nThe most notable emissions reductions unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic are attributed to progress made with purchasing more renewable power. We have increased the share of renewable power we use to 98 percent in 2021, nearing our 2022 goal of 100 percent.\n\nIn 2022, we restated 2019 and 2020 data to try to close coverage gaps and address the findings of the reasonable assurance audit. During the assurance audit on our 2021 data, we agreed, together with the auditors, to make improvements to the quality of a number of data points that only became available after the reporting period closed for the previous year. We focused on solutions to address data in a material manner, however we looked at materiality from a global perspective, from individual emissions categories and from a country perspective. We also found and addressed a system error in the calculation of 2019 commuting emissions. This resulted in an increase to our global base year emissions of approximately 10 percent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, we defined our Customer Experience\n\nStrategy, underpinned by a comprehensive set of standards for both retail and commercial insurance customers. These standards provide the quality benchmark for customer experience across the entire organization. By exceeding requirements of local laws and regulations for customer experience, we are better positioned to meet and surpass the expectations of our customers. All country business units have completed, or are undergoing, assessments to measure performance against our customer experience standards before setting action plans for remediation and continued improvement.\n\nThe standards cover a range of touchpoints throughout the customer journey (browsing, purchasing, joining, servicing, claiming, renewing etc.) and are set at different levels. These levels are:\n\n- - Red line standards, which uphold basic customer expectations beyond regulatory requirements.\n- - Target standards, which ensure we exceed expectations, for example, ensuring customers can access a simple, plainlanguage, single-page summary of complex documents or policies.\n- - Signature standards, which make us unique in the eyes of our customers.\n\nThese standards inform initiatives on both a local and Group-wide level, such as offering customers sustainable options (e.g., repair, not replace) and empathy training for front-line employees. Initiatives to improve performance to meet Zurich's customer experience standards are centrally recorded, tracked and mapped against customer KPIs, notably through transactional net promoter scores (TNPS) and relational net promoter scores (RNPS).\n\n## 5.1.1 Revenues from sustainable solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measuring our sustainable solutions through our internal definition\n\nIn 2021, we established our own definition of sustainable solutions and measured their associated revenues for the first time. A product/service must undergo a thorough assessment and meet our stringent criteria in order to be classified as a sustainable solution, any new solutions brought forward are approved throughout the year.\n\nThe term sustainable solutions refer to insurance products, add-on coverages, investment products and advisory services that are designed or adapted to support activities that generate a positive environmental or social impact and contribute to the mitigation of climate risks.\n\nThe table below provides a definition of revenues from sustainable solutions across three categories (environmental, social and investment).\n\n## Internal definition of revenues from sustainable solutions\n\nTable 15\n\n| Revenues from sustainable  environmental solutions   | Solutions related to technologies and/ or activities that have an impact on  reducing greenhouse gases, preserve  or enhance biodiversity as well as  enable the responsible use of natural  resources. These solutions aim to  mitigate and support resilience against  the adverse impact of environmental  related risks on our customers.   | Examples include:  - Insurance coverage for electric  vehicles. - Insurance coverage for carbon  mitigation solutions. - Risk prevention services that  contribute to more customer  awareness and resilience to the  adverse impacts of climate change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues from sustainable  social solutions          | Solutions that enhance the social or   financial inclusion of socially  disadvantaged people, or are designed  to incentivize healthy lifestyles and   safe behavior.                                                                                                                                                                           | Examples include: - Life protection for customers with  existing chronic diseases such as  diabetes or cancer. - Life protection policies sold in a                                                                                                       |\n| Revenues from sustainable  investment solutions      | Investment products with a focus on  sustainability both specific, and   not-specific, to environmental and  social aspects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Examples include: - Unit-linked products investing  in funds focused on sustainable  environmental and social factors, e.g.,  ESG funds.                                                                                                                  |",

Our flood resilience toolkit in the UK helps customers reduce the flood risk in their properties. In Ireland, we offer a discount on motor cover to those customers who also own a commuter ticket for travel on public transport.\n\nIn North America, we cover additional costs that might occur when choosing environmentally friendly alternatives to rebuild property after damage, thereby helping customers rebuild in compliance with existing or emerging green standards.\n\nIn Indonesia, we provide health protection for those who would not ordinarily get cover, for example those who have existing health conditions, as well as those who have been diagnosed with dengue, typhoid, pneumonia, diphtheria, and meningitis.\n\n## Revenues from sustainable solutions by region In USD millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nSustainable solutions meeting our internal criteria generated approximately USD 566 million (0.7 percent of our total gross written premiums and policy fee income) in revenues during 2022 (USD 289 million in 2021), with the largest contributions coming from North America at USD 238 million and EMEA with USD 177 million, providing a percentage increase of 377.3 percent and 25.8 percent, respectively.\n\nEMEA contributed just under a third of the revenues from sustainable solutions in 2022 at 31.3 percent, driven by growth in EV, sustainable energy and unit-linked solutions. North America contributed 42.0 percent of our revenues this year, driven by the first time inclusion of the workers compensation solution for truckers and independent service providers. APAC contributed 12.3 percent of sustainable revenues including both electric vehicle and solutions offered through our LiveWell business. LATAM generated revenues of USD 81 million, contributing 14.4 percent, mainly driven by our individual coverage to more exposed individuals solutions, for example the health solutions covering broken bones and burns for vulnerable customers as well as for health professionals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The two largest segments come from the electric vehicle and Individual coverage to more exposed individuals products with USD 111 million and USD 109 million respectively, or 19.6 and 19.2 percent of our sustainable revenues. While our workers compensation product for socially disadvantaged customers generated USD 103 million, 18.1 percent of total revenues.\n\nIn 2022, there were three product categories that contributed the most to the increase in our sustainable revenues result, namely micro-insurance coverage, EV and workers compensation for socially disadvantaged customers.\n\nOur individual coverage to more exposed individuals solutions are a top revenue generator in 2022, with revenues coming from our new farmers crop coverage against climatic, natural and biological events in LATAM. In addition, revenues from our credit life insurance, which provides cost-effective cover for low-income customers, contributed to the growth in this category.\n\nEV has also seen growth in 2022, reflecting the growing number of drivers choosing to buy EVs over ICE vehicles. Our expansion into e-mobility products, such as coverage for e-bikes, pedelecs and Segways, also contributed to our revenue position in 2022.\n\nRevenues from our workers compensation for socially disadvantaged customers reported for the first time in 2022 contributing USD 103 million to our results. The solution provides workers' compensation for occupational accident to those individual contractors engaging in short-term, temporary work, who would not ordinarily receive it.",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.1.1 Revenues from sustainable solutions (continued)\n\n## Case study\n\n## Electric vehicles\n\nOur approved EV solutions are sold to both retail and commercial customers for vehicles that are 100 percent electric. Although Zurich provides cover for hybrid vehicles, they do not meet our stringent criteria for sustainable revenues and are therefore not included in the above numbers for our sustainability reporting.\n\nAs an incentive to our retail customers, in Italy we offer a 50 percent discount on their car insurance if the vehicle is fully electric. Switzerland offers our retail customers a 20 percent discount on their vehicle insurance if the vehicle is electric, including e-vans, -cars and -motorbikes.\n\nIn Spain, we extended our standard motor policy to cover the additional needs of our EV retail customers, for example, including coverage for theft of a charging cable or damage done to home charging infrastructure. The roadside assistance product in Spain includes taxi fares should the car battery go flat. In Switzerland, we also cover the loss, theft, misuse and hacking of a charging card or app, including replacement costs.\n\nIn Turkey, our liability cover extends to firms in the retail sector who are actively converting light commercial vehicles from diesel to electric.\n\n## Sustainable energy\n\nOur sustainable energy products provide coverage for construction of solar and wind power farms. For example, our commercial business in Brazil covers all risks, such as property damage, liability and inland transit. Our retail customers in Switzerland are covered for alternative energy production, for example, geothermal probes and heat pumps, as well as fleet insurance for hydrogen-fueled trucks.\n\nIn the commercial business, our energy coverage includes property business in the energy segment, namely property damage, machinery breakdown and business interruption. These policies include the coverage of locations generating electricity from hydro, wind, geothermal and photovoltaic facilities and equipment.\n\nOur household cover in Ireland includes risks associated with solar panel installation and heat pumps, while in Italy, customers who have installed solar panels receive a 50 percent discount on household cover.\n\nAs more of our retail customers in Austria install solar panels onto their homes, we developed extensive coverage for solar panel- and solar energy plants, which covers, for example, costs from indirect lightning strikes, malicious attacks, breakdown and negligence, as well as constructional faults, material defects, fabrication defects and the breakdown of safety devices.\n\n## 5.1.2 Innovating for our customers\n\nWe believe insurance is key to facilitating the change required to achieve the low-carbon transition from two perspectives. Firstly, we work with customers and collaborate with public and private organizations to enhance resilience and advocate for solutions to prevent or minimize damage and harm from climate-related perils. Secondly, we develop insurance and risk management solutions for new technologies, business models and approaches that are needed to achieve a climate-neutral economy and provide our expertise to ensure management of the associated risks during implementation. We also use capital markets to search for and fund solutions to many pressing social or environmental issues. Our sustainable revenues provide our customers with innovative solutions, for example one of our Life Insurance products includes additional services to promote a healthy lifestyle, such as therapy, a second medical opinion, a nutritional consultation and health check without any additional costs.\n\n## Climate risk solutions\n\nWith respect to physical and operational risks potentially impacting our customers, we have expanded our existing natural hazards risk advisory service to include climate change risks. As part of our Climate Change Resilience Services (CCRS), a dedicated team of climate risk experts helps businesses better understand how climate change risk may affect their operations, strategy and financial position and ultimately strengthen their resilience to climate risks. This team not only supports customers in the development of resilience strategies and execution of the necessary measures, but also in various sustainability disclosure initiatives, e.g., TCFD, EU-Taxonomy for sustainable activities, and other regulatory frameworks. The team's approach is science-based and data-driven.\n\n## Unit-linked products\n\nIn 2022, we continued developing innovative unit-linked ESG solutions and making them available to more of our Life customers. We launched the Swiss Green Bonds Global Fund and articulated our carbon-reduction ambition on both the equity and credit allocations within our Irish multi-asset funds.",

As a result, the fund is now available in eight different countries: Chile, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. Despite challenging environment for financial markets, net flows into the fund were EUR 86 million with assets under management reaching EUR 253 million as at the end of 2022.\n\nAt the same time, we have started working on expanding the carbon-neutral fund range and further strengthening the fund's ESG focus.\n\n## Zurich Global Ventures\n\nAdditionally, Zurich Global Ventures, an innovation hub that drives the development of a series of independent and multi-faceted insurance-related solutions, was created (2021) with the aim, amongst others, of providing innovative services and product offerings that go beyond traditional insurance coverage and are available across markets globally. The goal is to get closer to our customers by offering a customized, proactive and digital experience that empowers individuals and businesses to be better prepared for the future. These new products and services complement our existing insurance propositions, with the aim of providing our customers with a wide range of solutions that meet their needs.\n\n## 5.2 Customer attraction and retention\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomer retention rate\n\nRetail - customer retention rate and net new customers 2022\n\nRetail retention rate 2 (2022)\n\n83%\n\n## Customer (m) Net new customers 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithin our insurance business, we continue to see growth in our retail customer base, adding an additional 2.1 million 3 customers in 2022 and growth in our partnership deals. Our ability to continue driving growth here is testament to our constant efforts to build meaningful relationships with our customers and distribution partners. In addition to the customer growth in our retail business, we have also delivered premium growth in our P&C commercial business across all regions within the Group.\n\n- 1 For the carbon offsetting, Zurich partners with one of the largest REDD+ peat swamp forest projects in the world. REDD+ is a United Nations-backed framework that aims to curb climate change by stopping the destruction of forests. REDD stands for 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation'; the '+' signifies the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.\n- 2  The customer retention rate is calculated based on retail core customers in the business units mentioned in footnote 3, excluding our affinity partners in Brazil, Germany, Indonesia - P&C and the bank joint ventures with Banco Sabadell and Banco Santander. This exclusion is due to the lower degree of operational control we have on the retention rate of these customers. When calculating the customer retention rate, the attrition of customers in employer-sponsored plans (e.g., life insurance plans) due to turnover (voluntary or involuntary) is not applicable. Additionally, the split between voluntary and involuntary lapse was not made.\n- 3  The number of customers and net new customers are calculated based on retail customers in the following business units: Argentina, Australia Life & P&C, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia Life and P&C, Ireland, Italy, Japan Life and P&C, Mexico, Malaysia, Portugal, Santander, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. To calculate these KPIs, the 2021 numbers have been recalculated to include nine additional countries. New countries in scope are: Argentina, Austria, Chile, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia Life and GI, Ireland, Mexico, Malaysia and Portugal. Besides extending the scope of countries included, 2021 customer counts were adjusted for reasons including data cleansing and inclusion of portfolios not previously reported.\n\n2,3",

Targeted growth has been achieved in the desired markets whilst delivering a constant and stable customer retention of 85 percent. The 2022 results reinforce our focus on maintaining customer loyalty while continuing to apply underwriting discipline. This consistency is testament to the strong relationships firmly established with our customer and distribution partners across multiple geographies and segments.\n\nOur Corporate Life and Pensions (CLP) business has 31,430 customers globally. 2 CLP enjoys long-term relationships with customers due to its proven relationship management model, with dedicated specialists both locally and globally who focus on our strategic distributor and customer relationships. In addition, in 2022 we made a number of innovations to our products to address the evolving needs of our corporate customers and their employees. One example is the refresh of Australia's Zurich Corporate Care product, which includes Zurich's well-being solution, LiveWell, and has led to an acceleration of new business growth. Finally, CLP is looking to expand its footprint in select markets, for example, in the UK, Zurich launched a new digital portal that caters to brokers who work with SME corporates.\n\n## Listening to our customers\n\nOur strong performance across all three segments gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction to offer products and services that are attractive and relevant to our retail and commercial customers. We continue to evolve our customer experience by listening to and acting on customer feedback through our TNPS programs. We surveyed around 1.2 million customers in 2022 across our business and acted based on their feedback. Actions ranged from small optimizations of processes to more sizeable and cross-functional measures. One example is the improvement of customer experience at our service call center in Spain, which included integration of the customer relationship management (CRM) system for a more personalized service and efficient use of the customer's time. Additionally, new protocols and training for empathetic and clear communication were developed, and monitoring and analysis of customer feedback was improved. This resulted in an improvement of +11 points in our TNPS score for this touchpoint over a period of 10 months in Spain. The combination of these small and large actions across the Group contributed to record levels of customer satisfaction, achieving a 6.9 point increase in our overall TNPS score 3 in 2022.\n\n- 1    The customer retention rate and number of customers are calculated based on the following business units:  Australia, Belgium & Luxemburg, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Middle East, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the U.S., (ex Crop & Programs & Leisure Travel). When calculating customer retention rate, the attrition of customers in employer-sponsored plans (e.g., life insurance plans) due to turnover (voluntary or involuntary) is not relevant for Commercial Insurance, additionally, the split between voluntary and involuntary lapse was not made. Numbers for 2021 have been recalculated to incorporate the addition of  three countries: Brazil, Colombia and Italy in both the customer retention and net new customer KPIs. Besides extending the scope of countries included, 2021 Customer Counts were adjusted for reasons including M&A activity & internal reclassifications across business units.\n- 2  The customer count for CLP is based on the following business units: Australia, Dubai, Hong Kong, cross border from Isle of Man and Luxembourg, international programs (ZGEBS), Switzerland, Spain and the UK.\n- 3  TNPS includes Argentina, Australia - Life, Australia - P&C, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia - Life, Indonesia - P&C, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Japan - Life, Japan - P&C, Luxembourg,  Malaysia - Life, Malaysia - P&C, Mexico, Middle East Life, Portugal, Sabadell, Santander, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and ZNA.",

We acknowledge that they can be exposed to different risks at different stages of the customer journey and believe that clear and transparent communication is critical to mitigate these risks. The Zurich code of conduct provides us with a north star that guides us in ensuring everything we do is held to the highest ethical, legal and professional standards. We have a Global customer-facing conduct framework 1 in place to support strong customer management, including fair communication practices, in all our business units.\n\nCustomer-facing conduct (CFC) refers to the activity undertaken to maximize the likelihood of fair and positive outcomes for our customers. The framework is designed to support business units in identifying, evaluating and mitigating the risks related to customer-facing conduct. It also supports developing detective and preventive control activities in existing processes across the customer lifecycle. Group Compliance supports and advises the business to enable effective management of CFC risks in alignment with the changing needs of our customers, new business models and the continued evolution of expectations from regulators and other stakeholders.\n\nGroup Compliance independently challenges, monitors and oversees compliance risks to provide assurance to management that the business is compliant with laws, regulations and internal requirements, professional and industry standards, and Zurich's corporate values.\n\n## 5.3.1 Customer communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo account for the wide range of products and services we provide across more than 215 countries and territories, our local businesses ensure that our approach to informing customers about our products is fully in line with both regulatory and customer expectations. We have a wide range of product literature available to inform customers about our products and services, including product\n\nsuitability, policy coverage, cost structures, exclusions, etc. Information on our range of products is available through several channels, including our website, financial intermediaries, email, social media, television, press, digital and print advertising.\n\n## 5.3.2 Continuously measuring and improving claims handling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers purchase insurance to transfer risks. Empathetic and competent claims services are critical to providing good customer service. We strive to put the customer at the heart of everything we do and to make the claims experience transparent, personal and responsive. We are also driving sustainable solutions in our claims handling processes which benefit our customers, people, partners and planet.\n\nThrough our TNPS program, we strive to gain a better understanding of how our customers experience different touchpoints of the customer journey. We consider claims handling to be one of the most important steps in customer experience, for which we won an award in 2022. 2 It is the ultimate test of our services. The claims TNPS provides us with feedback on how well we are performing in the eyes of our customers throughout the claim and helps us with insights on specific aspects or drivers that affect their experience. The claims TNPS is calculated for all countries with Retail Insurance presence and a broad set of countries for Commercial Insurance. The claims TNPS score 3 has been maintained in line with 2021 performance despite a challenging year and previous high ratings.\n\nWe have established a strong sustainability framework for Claims. This includes defined standards to support our customers, communities, people and partners. Every country has a three-year action plan to achieve the standards set out by the framework. The standards vary from loss prevention and mitigation to re-skilling our workforce. They also include making sustainability a key determining factor in developing future partnerships. We are committed to creating and working with partners to deliver innovative sustainable solutions ranging from growing the circular economy to providing extra support and care to our customers. For example:\n\nIn Portugal, we partnered with a company that focuses on repairing, rather than replacing, equipment damaged due to electrical issues with 738 repairs completed in 2022.\n\nIn Brazil, we have partnered with our motor repair body shops to certify them with a 'Green Seal'. This supports local businesses, ensures sustainable practices and raises awareness of sustainable measures that can be put in place, such as reducing water consumption and safe handling of waste (e.g., oil, tires). In 2022, we certified 158 motor repair body shops.\n\n- 2  Insurance Post: The British Insurance Awards 2022 'Customer Experience Award': https://www.insuranceawards.com/2022-winners\n- 3  TNPS includes Argentina, Australia - Life, Australia - P&C, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia - Life, Indonesia - P&C, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Japan - Life, Japan - P&C, Luxembourg,  Malaysia - Life, Malaysia - P&C, Mexico, Middle East Life, Portugal, Sabadell, Santander, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and ZNA.",

Our customers recover faster with digital services, as we can respond in a more sustainable and efficient way to their needs. In Australia, our Claims staff have been specifically trained to assist customers in vulnerable situations and are supported by vulnerable customer champions.\n\nThroughout our business, we recognize that customer vulnerability can be temporary, permanent or sporadic and could be related to health, life events (e.g., marriage, divorce, having children), capabilities (e.g., issues related to mental health, physical and mental disabilities), financial resilience and more. Examples range from supporting a customer with dementia by working with their loved ones and offering large font and Braille for visually impaired customers, to supporting a customer with a small business with cash flow problems by providing them with an interim payment as soon as possible.\n\nAnother example is Zurich UK's collaboration with the Marine Conservation Society to help preserve Britain's seagrass meadows. For every customer that makes a claim for escape of water or flood damage in a 12 month period starting in August 2022, Zurich will donate to the Marine Conservation Society to recover one square meter of seagrass:\n\n- - Initiative will help protect up to 10,000 square meters of seagrass meadow.\n- - Up to 92 percent of seagrass in the UK has disappeared in the last century.\n- - Healthy seagrass habitats can absorb around a tenth of the ocean's carbon each year.\n- - Seagrass is a vital habitat for endangered wildlife, including long-snouted, short-snouted and spiny seahorses.\n\n## 5.4 Digital confidence and trust\n\nOne of our goals is to make people and organizations more resilient by fostering confidence in a digital society. We aim to use this goal to improve customer experience. We are determined to be transparent about data management and Zurich's data protection and privacy policy, as this is a critical factor for customer trust.\n\nDuring the past year, we also focused on the development of AI solutions and invested in a resilient digital experience, in line with our customer promise.\n\nWe frequently educate our employees and senior management on our data protection and privacy policy and our data commitment. Our annual data protection and privacy training was assigned to all employees in 2022, with a global completion rate of 99.8 percent. 1 The completion rate was above 99 percent in all regions. The training highlights the importance of adhering to data protection and privacy policies, observing privacy rights and using personal data in a legal and transparent manner.\n\nIn addition, our annual information security awareness training covers a wide range of information security topics relevant to all employees, 2 with a completion rate of 97.1 percent. The completion rate was above 94 percent in all regions. This annual education is supported throughout the year with smaller, supplemental offerings in the form of tip sheets, bite-sized learning campaigns and more. Topics include working remotely and securely and creating strong passwords. Information security awareness training is reviewed and updated annually to remain on top of latest developments with cyber threats and Zurich policies and controls.\n\n## 5.4.1 Data commitment 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continued our global investment efforts to deliver on our data commitment, which aims to go beyond regulatory compliance.\n\nWe made progress across our businesses in the effectiveness, strength and robustness of\n\nprocesses and controls in place to ensure an increased level of transparency on how we collect, use and share personal data.\n\nThrough the implementation of our transformation and digitalization initiatives we support: i) proactive customer engagement, informing customers about how their personal data is being used and how consent is being obtained; ii) enhancement management and fulfillment of customer rights; iii) mitigation of risk of a potential misuse of personal data.\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, joint ventures and Zurich Global Ventures except for Cover-More and Zurich International.\n- 2  Reporting excludes employees of Cover-More.

International law enforcement and government agencies stepped up efforts to aggressively pursue cyber criminals and dismantle their infrastructure, with positive results in slowing the spread of ransomware. However the continued commoditization of malicious cyber\n\ncapabilities and growth of cyber crimeware-as-a-service have led to accelerated growth of cyber threats.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Zurich's investment in a layered defensive approach based on industry best practices and recognized frameworks, along with a continued improvement approach, has yielded success in protecting Zurich's data in line with our data commitment.\n\nWe invested in strengthening and enhancing Zurich's cyber defenses and data protection in 2022. This includes:\n\n- - Enhanced threat detection and response.\n- - Automated cyber threat hunting operations.\n- - Integration of phish simulation performance data with actual phish targeting and response data.\n- - Protection against service disruption attacks.\n- - Protection of web applications.\n- - Introduction of a dedicated cloud configuration management function.\n- - Proactive, behavior-based models for detecting insider risk.\n\nOur Cyber Fusion Center (CFC) continued to advance automation efforts to address ever-increasing numbers of threat alerts and phishing attempts.\n\nWe tripled the capacity of the offensive security Red Team 2 and began continuous, proactive searches for system vulnerabilities and unsecure configurations 3 in our systems.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, the team has detected and fixed more than 40 potentially critical security issues that could have led to a data breach or adverse impacts on our operations or our customers.\n\nAs data privacy and protection continues to be a key concern, and to align with our data commitment, we have expanded our data loss prevention program beyond EMEA to all regions globally. By the end of 2023, we expect to have all Zurich business units and functions fully adopting the Group-managed service or demonstrating equivalent capabilities. We are also adopting the newest technologies available on the market (such as next-generation firewalls, breach attack simulation, endpoint protection and multi-factor authentication) to help detect and remediate sensitive data access issues internally and prevent the loss of sensitive data externally.\n\nWe also deployed a new system to better detect software flaws across the information technology environment and provide a streamlined, efficient workflow for correcting them and reporting the results.\n\nWe strengthened our governance through the addition of a new assurance process that tests compliance with policies and controls related to cyber and information security. At the beginning of 2023, we will introduce an expanded control framework that adds third party risk, business resilience, data and information governance, and physical security controls to the existing IT controls portfolio.\n\nWe are investing in cutting-edge data science tools and processes to analyze the data we receive through the monitoring of our networks and IT systems in order to better detect malicious cyber activities. This allows us to detect hidden patterns in data and build data models to assist in further securing our environment.\n\nWe continue our dedication to full transparency concerning information security or cyber events that may result in the loss, exposure or misuse of customer data. We have strict protocols in place to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and will immediately inform and provide full assistance to any customers whose data or data privacy may be impacted, regardless of whether the incident involved Zurich directly or one of our partners.\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services and Zurich Global Ventures, however, Zurich International and Cover-More are included.\n- 2  Team conducts offensive security operations to identify and report vulnerabilities.\n- 3  Misconfigurations are flaws in the way a software environment is configured, security vulnerabilities are flaws in the software itself.",

These help us to deliver critical customer services under operational stress as part of our standards for minimum viable operating environment (MVOE). Highly critical services include email, telephony and the availability of customer, policy and claims data.\n\nIn 2022, we deployed a new global platform to support business impact analysis (BIA) and business continuity planning (BCP). Seven countries 2 started using this platform and more countries will adopt it in 2023. In parallel, we enhanced our recovery capabilities beyond traditional disaster recovery to allow restoration of critical IT infrastructure. This will ultimately support the recovery of critical business applications.\n\nWe are using our experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic and latest cyber threats, to further enhance our crisis management capabilities with additional readiness procedures, processes and communication tools. This allows for a more effective response to cyber, data and technology events.\n\nWe began planning and developing an initial framework to meet new operational resilience regulations, which came into force in Ireland and the UK in December 2021 and March 2022, respectively. We are developing a multi-year road map to implement this framework across the organization to ensure we are ahead of upcoming regulatory requirements and to further enhance our operational resilience.\n\n## 5.4.4 Ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we began to deploy the Zurich AI Assurance Framework - a governance model designed to safeguard the ethical use of AI solutions taking into consideration key requirements of emerging regulations, such as the EU AI Act, UK AI Rulebook, US Algorithmic Accountability Act, and the Monetary Authority Singapore's (MAS) Assessment Methodologies for Responsible Use of AI by\n\nFinancial Institutions. We aim to implement this framework by the end of 2023.\n\nParticular emphasis is given to developing capabilities (e.g., creation of a global AI use case inventory, an AI risks and impact assessment, a governance checklist for AI solutions) as well as implementing processes, controls and automated tools that ensure Zurich adheres to their ethical AI principles of fairness, transparency and accountability. Building on evolving best practices and guidelines from international governance bodies, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), we made significant progress on the definition of criteria for responsible and robust AI and assessment of AI use cases to mitigate potential risks.\n\nIn 2022, we have launched new use cases to enhance the efficiency of our retail and commercial insurance business operations. These included, for example, higher rates of straight-through processing in underwriting, automated motor insurance quotes based on photographs, as well as automated extraction of critical risk data from broker submissions and their integration in underwriting applications. In claims management, new AI use cases included real-time fraud detection in motor insurance and predicting claim severity in workers' compensation. We have scaled up conversational AI in numerous business units to enhance customer experience.\n\nOne strategic objective of using AI is to contribute to positive and sustainable societal outcomes, such as financial and social inclusion, affordability of insurance and fair treatment of vulnerable customers. To achieve this goal, we have begun to establish AI ethics committees to provide assurance and guidance on the implementation of AI solutions. These committees provide a holistic, diverse and balanced view on the risks and potential benefits of the AI solutions and its compliance with our ethical AI principles.\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services and Zurich Global Ventures, except for Zurich International.\n- 2  Australia, Austria, Canada, Italy, Mexico, UK and U.S.\n- 3  Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, joint ventures and Zurich Global Ventures, except for Zurich International and Cover-More.",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.1 Attracting talent for a sustainable future\n\n## 6.1.1 Attraction and retention of talent\n\nIn 2022, our Group headcount increased by 8 percent to 60,936 employees, driven mostly by acquisitions and organic growth. In parallel, we have successfully continued to attract, develop and retain employees with key skills and capabilities to future-proof our organization.\n\nThe total Group employee turnover increased to 12.9 percent compared to 11.9 percent in 2021. While the turnover rates are trending downward in APAC and North America, a continued increase can be observed in LATAM. Labor markets in EMEA are becoming more dynamic, resulting in higher turnover rates, although levels remain lower than those in North America, APAC and LATAM. This is partly in line with historical trends and the local market conditions. The total turnover of men and women is at 12.5 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively.\n\nOur NextGen employees, comprising millennials and Generation Z (Gen Z), continue to have a higher voluntary turnover rate compared with other generations. This is also in line with external market trends. As we remain focused on triangulating data from various sources e.g., employee feedback, our aim is to obtain relevant insights to help inform areas for improvement. Moreover, we continue to leverage our NextGen movement to test ideas and strengthen our existing propositions to employees. In Zurich North America (ZNA), we worked closely together with our local NEXT 1 hub following our global employee net promotor score (eNPS) survey. We ran a pulse survey and subsequently conducted focus groups to better understand the needs of this workforce segment. One of the topics frequently discussed was navigating careers at Zurich. As a result, our ZNA Talent Development team designed and implemented a Career Coaching program, which has been well received.\n\nOverall, we leverage the eNPS survey to ask for employee feedback and act upon it. In October 2022, we achieved a score of +54, the highest since the launch of our 'Place to Work' survey in 2018, with a Group-wide participation rate of 83 percent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Voluntary turnover refers to employees deciding to leave the company, e.g., for personal reasons. Involuntary turnover refers to cases where the decision to leave is not entirely made by the employee, e.g., retirement and mutual agreement.\n- 3   Gender breakdown excludes employees with no declared gender (0.1 percent of our total workforce).\n- 4   The high involuntary turnover for Baby boomers and prior generations is largely attributed to retirement.\n- 5   Career level breakdown excludes unranked employees (Cover-More, Farmers Management and Germany, covering 26 percent of our total workforce).\n\nPlease note that our internal grading system defines the following progression by career level: 1\n\n- - Career level A comprises all entry level and low specialization roles.\n- - Career level B includes frontline managers and technical staff.\n- - Career level C includes middle managers and highly specialized technical staff.\n- - Career level D comprises senior executives and senior experts.\n- - Career level E incorporates the most senior roles such as country CEOs and other senior business leaders. Senior management comprises career levels D and E together.\n- 1 The term 'unranked employees' refers to employees in Cover-More , Farmers Management and Germany who are not assigned career levels and are excluded (26 percent of our total workforce).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Internal appointments filled through lateral/vertical career movements are excluded, international transfers are included.\n- 2   Gender breakdown excludes employees with no declared gender (0.1 percent of our total workforce).\n- 3   EMEA represents almost half of our total workforce, excluding Farmers Management, hence this number is in line with our expectations.\n\nWe continue to focus on attracting and retaining employees from all generations to build a solid talent pipeline. Candidates continue to demonstrate strong negotiating power in certain markets, thus in order for us to improve our proposition and the overall recruiting experience, we have implemented a candidate survey which provides us with actionable feedback. For example, one of the key insights emphasized the importance of assigning an 'onboarding buddy' to support successful workplace integration which we have implemented in relevant markets.\n\nOur NextGen population continues to grow as Gen Z increasingly enters the workforce. In 2022, 51 percent of our workforce belonged to NextGen, and this segment contributed 77 percent of the new hires. Looking at our new hires by gender, the split between male and female was close to equal, with 49.3 percent vs. 49.8 percent, respectively.\n\nIn sync with our focus on Gen Z as a growing segment of our workforce, we continue to place significant focus in supporting our apprenticeship programs globally. As part of this commitment, we launched an 'apprenticeship buddy program' which provides our apprentices with the opportunity to connect and collaborate with peers across the Group. To date seven countries and more than 100 apprentices are participating.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Entry-level roles (career level A) are by nature disproportionally filled with external candidates, therefore not included in the table. Employees that transferred between countries are excluded and employees that have been rehired are included.\n- 2   Internal hire percentage represents the proportion of appointments filled internally (through lateral or vertical career moves) versus through a new external hire.\n\n3   Gender breakdown excludes employees with no declared gender (0.1 percent of our total workforce).\n\n- 4   Senior management represents the combination of career levels D and E.\n\nWe continue to prioritize internal over external hires, which is reflected in the 2022 internal hire rate of 71 percent. This is an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2021. This figure excludes hires into entry-level roles (career level A) as these positions are, by nature, disproportionally filled by external career starters.\n\nAt a senior level, we have strengthened our internal leadership pipeline to support career growth through vertical and lateral moves. This is reflected in our internal hire rate for the senior management population which is at 86 percent. Thus, external hires are mainly focused on bringing in critical skills and continue to diversify the composition of our employee population globally.\n\n## 6.1.2 Training and development\n\nAt Zurich, we invest in the development of our people through mentoring, secondments, part-time assignments and formal learning. Our global learning platform, MyDevelopment, offers more than 18,000 courses, including the full library of LinkedIn Learning. We recognize the importance of offering employees varied learning opportunities in a number of key domains. We have therefore advanced our offering in a number of areas, for example, building managerial and technical skills through access to a total of 13 technical academies.\n\nOur employees spent more than 1.2 million hours on online learning in 2022, resulting in an average of over 26 hours per employee. This represents an increase of 3 hours per employee compared with 2021. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we spent more than USD 33 million on training across the Group, an average of USD 728 per employee. 2\n\n- 1    In 2022 we adjusted our calculation to include all employees that consumed learning content in the reporting year. In prior years we only considered employees that were active at the end of the reporting year. This resulted in an increase of the employees included into the metric and as a consequence also the hours learned.\n- 2  Reporting excludes Bolivia and unranked employees (Cover-More, Farmers Management and Germany, covering 26 percent of our total workforce). Employees refers to both full-time and part-time employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 'Digital Mastery Program', helps employees to further develop critical skills and learn new skills related to digital transformation and other technologies. We also continued to focus on developing leadership and managerial excellence through 'Inspiring Trust', our global manager development program, and the 'Brighter Future Together' leadership team program.\n\nOur global commercial insurance academy focuses on building unique and interactive courses tailored to meet the needs of our employees by blending a variety of learning approaches to deliver content and enable the practice and eventual mastery of skills. These programs focus not only on technical proficiency in certain areas, for example, our course in active portfolio management, but also support the mastery of interpersonal skills, such as relationship building and negotiations via our 'Winning in the Market' programs.\n\n## 6.2 A safe working environment that supports health and well-being\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our employees is a cornerstone of our ambition to be a sustainable employer. We continue to strengthen our credentials in this space by providing guidance and solutions to cultivate a work environment in which employees can thrive. To read more about our global employee well-being framework and initiatives, please see Employee well-being at Zurich. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe support the physical safety of our employees and continue to report a low accident frequency rate of 113 accidents 2 and zero fatalities per almost 110 million working hours. For a more detailed breakdown of the number and rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury, please see the index tables on our webpage. 3\n\n## 6.3 An integrated and systematic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB)\n\n## 6.3.1 Ratio of compensation to areas of equality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe put a strong focus on maintaining an inclusive and equitable workplace and have implemented measures to monitor progress globally. We have successfully obtained an EDGE 4 certification for several business units across the Group. 5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing this, we developed an in-house equal pay for equivalent work (EPEW) methodology to consistently evaluate whether our people are paid equally for the same or similar roles across the Group. This analysis forms part of our yearly remuneration review cycle.\n\n1\n\n- www.zurich.com/en/careers/wellbeing\n- 2  Reporting excludes Bolivia.\n- 3   www.zurich.com/sustainability/reporting\n- 4  www.edge-cert.org/\n- 5  As of December 2022, the following business units are EDGE certified: Argentina, Australia, Brazil Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Santander Brazil, Mexico, and Spain.

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.3.1 Ratio of compensation to areas of equality (continued)\n\nIn Switzerland, we have voluntarily conducted internal equal pay analysis for many years. Since 2020, it has become mandatory under Swiss law for companies with 100 or more employees to carry out an externally certified equal pay analysis. In accordance with these requirements, relevant data was evaluated by Switzerland's standard analysis tool for equal pay in 2021 and subsequently audited by the Swiss competence center 1 and the Employee Commission. The result positioned the Swiss business unit and Corporate Center well within the tolerance range of +5 percent to -5 percent, and these results were communicated internally to all employees.\n\nZurich UK publishes pay gap information across multiple dimensions, for example, gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability, to support pay transparency. The pay gap indicates the difference in average pay between two employee groups, and is not the same as equal pay for equivalent work, which Zurich UK measures separately. Differences are normally driven by an imbalance of representation at senior levels. 2\n\nTo find out more about equal pay for equivalent work, please see Pay equality at Zurich. 3\n\n## 6.3.2 Global DEIB framework\n\nWe strive to integrate diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) into everything we do by taking targeted actions to increase and benefit from diversity within the workforce, to ensure equal opportunities and to foster inclusion and belonging.\n\nWe continue to invest in our employee resource groups (ERGs) across the organization, in order to foster exchange across functions, geographies, hierarchies and generations. Our women's innovation network (WIN) is our biggest ERG with several thousand members across all continents. With our ERGs, we strive to raise awareness of and promote diversity and inclusion, cultivate a sense of belonging and create social networks to drive cultural change.\n\nTo find out more about our efforts to support diversity and inclusion, please see DEIB at Zurich. 4\n\n## Ratio of majority vs. minority in 2022 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 20\n\n| Dimension                                         |   Career   level A (%) |   Career   level B (%) |   Career   level C (%) | Career   level D (%)   | Career   level E (%)   | Senior   manage-  ment  2  (%)   |   Total 2022 -  independent of  career level (%) |   Total 2021 -  independent of  career level (%) |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Female  3                                         |                   63.1 |                   47.2 |                   37.8 | 29.0                   | 24.2                   | 28.7                             |                                             50.6 |                                             50.6 |\n| Male                                              |                   36.8 |                   52.6 |                   62.1 | 71.0                   | 75.8                   | 71.3                             |                                             49.3 |                                             49.4 |\n| Baby boomers and prior  generations (before 1964) |                    9.2 |                   11   |                   11.6 | 13.5                   | 20.0                   | 13.9                             |                                             10.6 |                                             12.1 |\n| Gen X (1965 - 1980)                               |                   29.1 |                   39.4 |                   56.2 | 70.1                   | 78.9                   | 70.6                             |                                             38.9 |                                             40.4 |\n| millennials (1981 - 1996)                         |                   45.8 |                   47.2 |                   32.2 | 16.3                   | 1.1                    | 15.5                             |                                             44   |                                             43   |\n| Gen Z (1997 and after)                            |                   15.9 |                    2.3 |                    0.1 |                        |                        |                                  |                                              6.5 |                                              4.6 |\n| National  4                                       |                   93.9 |                   89.7 |                   83.4 | 73.7                   | 41.5                   | 71.9                             |                                             89.5 |                                             89.8 |\n| Non-National                                      |                    6.1 |                   10.3 |                   16.6 | 26.3                   | 58.5                   | 28.1                             |                                             10.5 |                                             10.2 |\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Bolivia, unranked employees (Cover-More, Farmers Management and Germany, covering 26 percent of our total workforce).\n- 2   Senior management represents the combination of career levels D and E.\n- 3   Gender breakdown excludes employees with no declared gender (0.1 percent of our total workforce).\n- 4   This data excludes North America, for additional information on ethnicity in North America, see: www.zurichna.com/knowledge/articles/2020/08/9-actions-on-racial-equityfrom-zurich-north-america\n- 1 www.elep.ch/de/diese-unternehmen-sind-dabei/\n\n- 3  www.zurich.com/en/careers/our-people/pay-equality\n- 4  www.zurich.com/careers/deib\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.3.2 Global DEIB framework (continued)\n\nAt Zurich, we continuously strive to reach gender balance across the organization. As of end of 2022, 50.6 percent of our employee population is female. In addition, we undertake targeted actions and monitor gender representation across multiple dimensions including career levels and generations. We continue to support the development of female talent to accelerate their readiness for leadership positions in the future. Programs such as the connect female sponsorship program in Commercial Insurance or the female acceleration talent initiative in LATAM are just two examples of the many development programs across the Group.\n\nThese and other initiatives have helped drive improvements in gender balance between 2017 and 2022, particularly in the most senior career levels D and E. In 2017, the percentage of females in career level D and career level E were 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Female employees were representing a combined 22 percent in senior management. At the end of 2022, the proportion of females in career level D increased by 2.5 percentage points to 29.0 percent in 2022, from 26.5 percent in 2021. For career level E the female representation increased with 0.7 percentage points to 24.2 percent in 2022, from 23.5 percent in 2021. Female employees were representing a combined 28.7 percent in senior management in 2022, compared to 26.3 percent in 2021.\n\nAcross the Group, we see a tendency for non-national employees to have greater representation at more senior career levels. This can be explained by the movement of seasoned, internal talent to new opportunities across our Group.\n\n## 6.4 Prevention of bribery and corruption\n\n## 6.4.1 Group anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGiven the serious consequences of financial crime, we invest heavily in controls to prevent and detect any bribery or corruption. We have put in place strong and effective controls and we monitor financial, legal and regulatory developments to conduct business in an ethical and compliant manner.\n\nZurich's Group policy anti-bribery and anti-corruption (Group policy ABC) sets out the minimum requirements with which its subsidiaries worldwide, including Board members and employees, need to comply.\n\nThe Group policy ABC requires the appointment of an anti-bribery and corruption officer (ABCO) for each business unit. The ABCO's duty is to monitor compliance with the Group policy ABC and the applicable local anti-bribery and anti-corruption framework. The ABCO also supports business management in maintaining the local framework and reviewing it regularly to ensure that it appropriately addresses bribery and corruption risks in the business unit.\n\n## 6.4.2 Training and awareness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFostering a culture of compliance among all our employees is important. To achieve this, it is critical to encourage general awareness and understanding of potential areas of bribery and corruption risk, applicable laws, and our policies.\n\nWe frequently educate our employees and Board members 1 on topics related to compliance and ethics. This begins with mandatory code of conduct training. 2 This annual training raises awareness of what it means to do the right thing. It helps employees and managers feel more confident in making ethical decisions in their day-to-day work. Among other topics covered, the training helps employees to spot and report possible bribery and corruption incidents. In 2022, almost all our employees and senior management completed the training, resulting in a global completion rate of 99.97 percent. The completion rate was above 99 percent in all regions. 3\n\nEmployees whose roles expose them to potentially greater bribery and corruption-related risks are also required to undergo enhanced training on how to identify and respond to potential bribery and corruption risks.\n\nGroup Compliance develops the training in line with the Group policy ABC and in consideration of local risks, regulations and requirements for each jurisdiction. The training is reviewed on an annual basis to incorporate new developments and requirements. This keeps our employees and management at the forefront of the prevention of bribery and corruption and helps us fulfil our ambition of being a responsible and ethical business.\n\n- 1 The code of conduct training will be mandatory for Zurich Insurance Group Ltd / Zurich Insurance Company Ltd Board members as of 2023.\n- 2  The code of conduct training includes the topic of anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n- 3   In 2022, the code of conduct training was shared with Zurich Insurance Group Ltd Board members and various business partners depending on country requirements. Completion for both groups was not centrally tracked.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If employees suspect misconduct, we want them to feel comfortable reporting their concern and feel supported by the organization when doing so.\n\nThere are multiple channels for employees to raise concerns, including local line managers and Legal or Compliance functions. They can also use the Zurich Ethics Line (ZEL) to report concerns, either via telephone or online via a web form. The ZEL can also be used by other stakeholders, including external stakeholders, to raise concerns. Reports to the ZEL can be made anonymously. Zurich does not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports a concern in good faith.\n\nThe ZEL is available globally and offers support in local languages. Once a report is received, it is sent to a designated person within Zurich to be reviewed and, if necessary, investigated. If a report of misconduct is substantiated, we will take remedial actions as appropriate, including potential disciplinary action, and if required, referring the matter to the relevant authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable and limited assurance as to whether the KPIs in the Report; are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Summary of work performed\n\n## Limited assurance:\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in scope than, for a reasonable assurance. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained for a limited assurance is significantly lower than the level of assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance.\n\nAlthough we considered the effectiveness of management's internal control when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal control.\n\nOur limited assurance procedures included, amongst others, the following work:\n\n- \uf084 Assessment of the suitability of the underlying criteria and their consistent application\n- \uf084 Inqu iries of Zurich Insurance Group's representatives responsible for collecting, consolidating, and calculating the KPIs to assess the process of preparing the data, the reporting system, the completeness of the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal control to the extent relevant for the limited assurance engagement\n- \uf084 Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and processes for compiling, analyzing, and aggregating the KPIs and testing such documentation on a sample basis\n- \uf084 Analytical procedures and inspection of documents on a sample basis with respect to the compilation and reporting of the KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the KPIs in scope of reasonable assurance. In making those risk assessments, we considered internal control relevant to Zurich Insurance Group's preparation of the KPIs in scope of reasonable assurance.\n\nOur reasonable assurance procedures included, amongst others, in addition to the procedures listed above for the limited assurance engagement, the following work:\n\n- \uf084 Site visits (physical or virtual) in 10 countries to visually inspect operations, perform inquiries and inspect documents on a sample basis\n- \uf084 Testing, on a sample basis, of underlying source information to check the accuracy of the data\n- \uf084 Identification and testing of assumptions supporting calculations\n- \uf084 Evaluation of the overall presentation, structure and content of the environmental disclosures\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw your attention to the fact that certain KPIs in the Report in scope of the limited and reasonable assurance, as identified in the ' KPIs reported for year 2021 ' section in the Appendix, are for the year ended 31 December 2021. Our limited assurance conclusion and reasonable assurance opinion are not modified in respect of the matter emphasized.\n\n## Conclusion -limited assurance\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the KPIs in scope of limited assurance have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\n\n## Opinion -reasonable assurance\n\nIn our opinion, the KPIs in scope of reasonable assurance are prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\n\nErnst & Young Ltd\n\nIsabelle Santenac\n\nMark Veser Partner\n\nPartner\n\nAppendix: Performance indicators in assurance scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was a year marked by the resurfacing of historic and intertwined challenges previously considered to have been vanquished - war in Europe, high inflation, energy crises and escalating tensions between major geopolitical powers.\n\nDespite the volatile environment, the Group has continued to remain financially robust and operationally resilient to continue to serve our customers. While there are significant external challenges, our solid risk management provides optimism that the Group can continue to build on its success in the years to come.\n\nThis position has been reached through diligent and patient preparation, which has allowed us to adapt quickly to identify, assess and manage the threats arising from today's uncertain and rapidly changing world.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has been supplemented by the ongoing application of our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology, which has helped to maintain our focus on the risks that matter.\n\n## Finding solutions for complex challenges\n\nThe war in Ukraine and subsequent energy crisis has added to an already difficult backdrop marked by social imbalances, large-scale public debt, cyber warfare and threats to public health. As authorities and societies continue\n\nto search for adequate solutions, challenges are heightened by inadequate preparation, competing interests and the consequences of past decisions.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than in the struggle to tame high inflation. Governments and central banks are scrambling to respond only this time without the firepower and levers once available for similar crises in the past. With limited scope to concurrently manage economic and associated societal pressures, the risk of policy error remains high.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, our expertise and tools, such as dynamic scenario and sensitivity analyses, to assess and proactively manage potential impacts, are more important than ever. We continue to use the output of scenario assessments, to develop, implement and monitor actions for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWhile the risk landscape becomes ever more complex, climate change remains the overarching challenge to be tackled in\n\n## Development of Swiss Solvency Test ratio\n\n## Highlights by risk type\n\nThe Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio increased to 265 percent 1 as of January 1, 2023 from 212 percent as of January 1, 2022. The development of the SST ratio in 2022 reflects strong underlying capital generation, portfolio management and a significant rise in interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The SST results as of January 1, 2023 are estimated and may differ from the final SST results, which will be presented in the Financial Condition Report at the end of April 2023.\n\n## Analysis of Group total risk capital\n\nin %, as of January 1, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Insurance risk\n\n48%\n\n- Market risk, including investment credit risk\n\n50%\n\nOther credit risk\n\n2%\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nThe Group's insurance risk is diversified by geography, line of business, product and customer, supported by our centralized purchase of reinsurance which led to continued sound insurance outcomes in 2022 in the face of natural catastrophes and the inflationary environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more:\n\nPages 210-216\n\n## Market risk\n\nRequired capital held by the Group for investment risk taking declined during 2022. This is the result of higher interest rates affecting asset and liability market values and a resulting improvement in capital held against any asset-liability mismatch. Financial market volatilities have been stable against prior year while remaining elevated against long-term averages. Market risk has been reduced during the year as a result of the disposal of the Italian Life back book and other actions associated with the German Life back book. The Group's investment portfolio remains well diversified across risk drivers and geographies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more:\n\nPages 217-223\n\n## Other credit risk\n\nCredit Quality remained stable despite challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more:\n\nPages 223-224\n\n## Operational risk\n\nZurich's operational risk management approach enables the Group to focus on high-priority matters under demanding circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntoday's world. Managing the risks posed by climate change in tandem with the Group's commitment to sustainability, remains a central part of Zurich's risk management approach.\n\nThe scale of the challenge we face means a cross-society approach is required. Zurich is playing its part in responding but also aims to inspire action together with its customers and investees by continuing to promote best practices in managing the interconnectivity of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.\n\n## Strong financial position\n\nOur financial strength remained at historically strong levels during 2022 (see page 207 for Swiss Solvency Test results). This reaffirms our resilience and ability to continue to support our customers in shaping their future.\n\nPeter Giger Group Chief Risk Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich takes risks in order to support the achievement of its strategy and serve its customers in global and local markets. Risk management contributes to enhancing the value of Zurich by embedding disciplined and conscious risk taking, where risk-reward trade-offs are transparent and understood, and risks are appropriately rewarded.\n\nThe Group's objectives in managing risks are to:\n\n- - Support achievement of its business strategy and objectives, protect capital, liquidity, earnings and reputation by identifying, assessing, responding to, monitoring and reporting risks in line with the Group's risk appetite and tolerance.\n- - Enable the Board of Directors (the 'Board'), senior management and other stakeholders charged with governance and oversight, to discharge their risk management responsibilities, including risk reporting and external disclosures.\n- - Support transparency in decision-making processes by providing consistent, reliable and timely risk information.\n- - Embed a culture of risk awareness and disciplined and informed risk-taking.\n\n## Enterprise risk management framework\n\nTo achieve its risk management objectives, the Group manages risk according to an established enterprise risk management (ERM) framework. The Group's ERM framework is the structure to manage risks within the organization. It is comprised of six components: risk governance and risk culture, risk appetite and tolerance, risk identification and risk assessment, risk response, risk monitoring, and risk reporting. The Group's ERM framework is documented by both policy and non-policy documents, including the Zurich Risk Policy (ZRP) and related risk policy manuals, and is complemented by training and guidance materials.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite and tolerance statement reflects Zurich's willingness and capacity to take risks in pursuit of value creation and sets boundaries within which the businesses act. Zurich protects its capital, liquidity, earnings and reputation by monitoring that risks are taken within agreed risk appetite levels and tolerance limits. The Group regularly assesses and, as far as possible, quantifies material risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe ZRP is a Group policy that articulates Zurich's approach to risks and sets mandatory requirements for risk management throughout the Group. The policy describes the Group's ERM framework and provides a standardized set of risk types. Risk-specific policy manuals provide requirements and procedures to implement the principles in the ZRP.\n\nThe Group identifies, assesses, manages, monitors and reports risks that have an impact on the achievement of its business strategy and objectives by applying its proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. The methodology allows Zurich to assess risks in terms of severity and likelihood, and supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n\nTo foster transparency about risk, the Group regularly reports on its risk profile at business, Group, and Board levels. The Group has procedures to refer risk topics to senior management and the Board of Directors in a timely manner.\n\nThe Group's solvency position is disclosed on the basis of the Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio. The Group's SST internal model is approved by the Swiss Financial Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Zurich's goal is to maintain capital consistent with a 'AA' financial strength rating for the Group, which translates into an SST ratio target of 160 percent or above.\n\nThe Group applies the Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM) as an internal metric. Z-ECM provides a key input into the Group's planning process as an assessment of the Group's economic risk profile.\n\n## Risk-based remuneration\n\nBased on the Group's remuneration rules, the Board of Directors designs and structures remuneration arrangements that support the achievement of strategic and financial objectives and do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nGroup Risk Management's role in respect of remuneration and its interaction with Board committees is described in the remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further adjustments usually include items such as intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, allowing for discounting of liabilities and the value of in-force business, and market-consistent valuation of external debt according to the methodology under SST.\n\nZurich strives to simplify the Group's legal entity structure to reduce complexity and increase fungibility of capital.\n\nOn January 1, 2023 the Group adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. For more information including the transitional effects on shareholders' equity, refer to note 2 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capital management framework\n\nThe Group's capital management framework forms the basis for actively managing capital within Zurich. The Group uses a number of different capital models, taking into account economic, regulatory, and rating agency constraints. The Group's capital and solvency position is monitored and regularly reported to the Executive Committee (ExCo) and Board of Directors.\n\nZurich's policy is to allocate capital to businesses earning the highest risk-adjusted returns, and to pool risks and capital as much as possible to operationalize its risk diversification.\n\nThe Group's executive management determines the capital management strategy and sets the principles, standards and policies to execute the strategy. Group Treasury and Capital Management executes the strategy.\n\n## Capital management program\n\nThe Group's capital management program comprises various actions to optimize shareholders' total return and to meet capital needs, while enabling Zurich to take advantage of growth opportunities. Such actions include paying and receiving dividends, capital repayments, share buybacks, issuance of shares, issuance of senior and hybrid debt, securitization and purchase of reinsurance.\n\nThe Group seeks to maintain a balance between returns for shareholders and the security that a sound capital position provides, also for our customers. Dividends, share buybacks, and issuances and redemption of debt have a significant influence on capital levels. During 2022, the Group:\n\n- - paid a dividend out of retained earnings and capital contribution reserve,\n- - bought own shares to reduce future dilution from share-based employee compensation plans and to offset expected earnings dilution related to the sale of a legacy traditional life insurance back book in Germany, which is subject to regulatory approval, and\n- - issued senior and hybrid debt to refinance maturing and callable debt and to early repay hybrid debt, as well as to finance investments in the Group's development.\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations stipulates that dividends may only be paid out of freely distributable reserves or retained earnings. Apart from what is specified by the Swiss Code of Obligations, Zurich Insurance Group Ltd faces no legal restrictions on dividends it may pay to its shareholders. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of the statutory general legal reserve was more than 50 times the paid-in share capital. The ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends may be restricted or indirectly influenced by minimum capital and solvency requirements imposed by insurance and other regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. Other limitations or considerations include foreign exchange control restrictions in some countries, and rating agencies' methodologies.\n\nFor more information on issuances and redemptions of debt, see note 18 of the consolidated financial statements. For more information on acquisitions and divestments, see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In each country in which the Group operates, the local regulator specifies the minimum amount and type of capital that each of the regulated entities must hold in addition to their liabilities. In addition to the minimum capital required to comply with the solvency requirements, the Group aims to hold an adequate buffer under local solvency requirements to ensure regulated subsidiaries can absorb a level of volatility and meet local capital requirements.\n\n## Regulatory solvency regimes\n\n## Regulatory requirements in Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss Solvency Test (SST) adopts a risk-based and total balance sheet approach. Insurance companies are required to provide a market-consistent assessment of the value of their assets and liabilities. Possible changes to these balance sheet positions are modelled over a one-year period to arrive at the total required capital.\n\nUnder the SST, insurance companies and insurance groups can apply to use company-specific internal models to calculate risk-bearing and target capital, as well as the SST ratio. The SST ratio must be calculated as per January 1 and submitted to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Zurich filed with FINMA an SST ratio of 212 percent (unaudited) as of January 1, 2022. Zurich met the regulatory solvency requirements in Switzerland throughout 2022.\n\nThe estimated SST ratio as of January 1, 2023 stands at 265 percent (unaudited). The final SST ratio as of January 1, 2023 will be filed with FINMA by the end of April 2023 and is subject to review by FINMA.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the European Economic Area (EEA)\n\nThe main regulatory framework governing the Group's subsidiaries in the EEA is Solvency II. This is a risk-based capital framework which covers capital requirements (pillar 1), governance and risk management (pillar 2) and reporting (pillar 3). All EEA-based legal entities of the Group use the Solvency II standard formula for their pillar 1 requirements with the exception of Zurich Insurance plc (Ireland) that applies an approved internal model. A scheduled review of the Solvency II framework is currently being conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and will entail changes to the standard formula, reporting and introduces new rules around macro-prudential supervision and sustainability. The revised framework is expected to become effective from January 1, 2025.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the UK\n\nThe United Kingdom left the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020, meaning UK regulations can diverge from Solvency II regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2022 the UK regulations have not materially diverged. However, a review of the regulations (now called Solvency UK) was completed by the UK government in 2022, and this identified a number of areas where the regulations should be amended to better reflect the UK market. In 2023 and 2024, the PRA and UK HM Treasury will work to enable the UK government's proposals.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., required capital is determined to be 'company action level risk-based capital' calculated using the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' risk-based capital model. This method, which builds on statutory accounts, measures the minimum amount of capital for an insurance company to support its overall business operations by taking into account its size and risk profile.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions\n\nEvery country has a capital standard for insurance companies. Several jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and Mexico) have implemented approaches similar to Solvency II.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market value margin, also known as risk margin, is the cost of future regulatory risk capital stemming from the present portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn 2022, the solvency of the Group has improved by 53 ppts with an estimated SST ratio of 265 percent as of January 1, 2023, well above the Group's SST ratio target of 160 percent. The Group solvency has benefitted from the strong rise in interest rates across all currencies. Strong capital generation and M&A transactions had further positive impact of the ratio.\n\nIn the SST ratio calculations as of January 1, 2023, no allowances have been made for the sale of the German traditional life insurance back book which is subject to regulatory approval, however the announced share buy back is accounted for.\n\n## SST available financial resources\n\nThe Group's AFR are derived from the SST net asset value (NAV). The NAV represents the difference between the market-consistent value of assets and liabilities according to the market-consistent valuation methodology under SST.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group's AFR reduced by USD 10.1 billion to USD 42.3 billion as of January 1, 2023, compared to USD 52.4 billion as of January 1, 2022. The main drivers of the AFR decrease in 2022 were negative equity and credit market development, USD appreciation and accounting for the announced share buy back and reduction of subordinated debt.\n\n## SST target capital\n\nThe Group uses an internal risk model to determine the required target capital (TC).\n\nThe Group's TC as of January 1, 2023 amounted to USD 18.7 billion, a decrease of USD 9.1 billion compared to USD 27.8 billion as of January 1, 2022, primarily due to a reduction in market risk following the interest rates raise and USD appreciation against major currencies.\n\nTable 1\n\n| in USD billions                         | January 1,  2023  1   | January 1,  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Total risk capital                      | 19.1                  | 24.3               |\n| Other effects on target capital (TC)  2 | (4.9)                 | (2.2)              |\n| Market value margin (MVM)               | 4.5                   | 5.7                |\n| TC                                      | 18.7                  | 27.8               |\n| TC minus MVM                            | 14.2                  | 22.1               |\n| Available financial resources (AFR)     | 42.3                  | 52.4               |\n| AFR minus MVM                           | 37.7                  | 46.7               |\n| Group SST ratio                         | 265%                  | 212%               |\n\n- 1 The SST results as of January 1, 2023 are estimated and may differ from the final SST results, which will be presented in the Financial Condition Report at the end of April 2023.\n- 2   Other effects are expected business development over the forecasting horizon, additional business costs and FINMA requirements.\n\n## Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio and underlying components\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of January 1, 2023, the largest components of total risk are market risk and premium and reserve risk, comprising 50 percent and 25 percent of the total risk capital, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in total risk capital as of January 1, 2023 compared to January 1, 2022, follows a reduction in market risk, mainly due to the substantially higher interest rate environment and appreciation of the USD against major currencies. Other risk types benefitted from the higher interest rate environment to a smaller degree.\n\nIn absolute terms premium and reserve risk remained largely unchanged, however, in relative terms its contribution to the total risk capital has increased to 25% as of January 1, 2023 compared to 16% as of January 1, 2022, following the reduction in market risk and the overall reduction of the total risk capital.\n\n## Total risk capital, split by risk type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sensitivity and scenario analysis\n\nThe Group evaluates sensitivities to, and stress scenarios on, the SST ratio, and assesses results relative to Zurich's risk appetite and tolerance. The sensitivities and stress scenarios in the chart below capture two key risks to the Group: market risk and insurance risk.\n\nMarket risk sensitivities show the estimated impact on the Group's SST ratio of a half percentage-point (50 basis points, or bps) increase or decrease in yield curves, a 10 percent appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar, a 20 percent rise or decline in all stock markets, and a 100 bps increase in credit spreads, with and without euro-denominated sovereign bonds. The sensitivities are considered as separate but instantaneous shocks. They are a best estimate and non-linear, for example, a change to the size of the market movement could result in disproportionally higher (or lower) impact on the SST ratio depending on the prevailing market conditions at the time.\n\nFor insurance risk, the chart shows the three largest natural catastrophe events to which the Group is exposed. Insurance risk scenarios are defined as events that have a small probability of occurring but could, if realized, negatively affect the Group's AFR. The impact of insurance-specific scenarios on the target capital is not taken into account.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The insurance financial strength rating (IFSR) of the Group's main operating entity, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC), is an important element of Zurich's competitive position, while the Group's credit ratings also affect the cost of debt capital.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, Moody's changed ZIC's rating outlook from Aa3 stable to positive, positioning the company as one of the first European insurers to approach the Aa2 level.\n\nAccording to Moody's, 'the change in outlook to positive reflects Zurich's improved profitability that has become stronger and less volatile, supported by a more balanced business mix with reduced risk in its commercial insurance business and diminished exposure to interest rate and credit risk expected on completion of its life insurance back-book sales.'\n\nAs of January 2023, the IFSR of ZIC was rated 'AA/Stable' by S&P Global Ratings, 'Aa3/positive by Moody's, and 'A+ (Superior)/Stable' by AM Best.

        "page_content": "## Analysis by risk type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of deviations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events from that expected, leading to loss, including adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities (Life and Property & Casualty (P&C)). This may result from inherent uncertainty of insured events or losses, inadequate or ineffective underwriting or accumulation management, inappropriate product development, pricing, claims management, reserving or reinsurance. The profitability of insurance business is also susceptible to business risk in the form of unexpected changes in expenses, policyholders' behavior, and fluctuations in new business volumes. Zurich manages insurance risk through:\n\n- - Specific underwriting and claims standards and controls.\n- - Robust reserving processes.\n- - External reinsurance.\n\n## Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nP&C insurance risk arises from coverage provided for motor, property, liability, special lines and worker injury. It comprises premium and reserve risk, catastrophe risk, and business risk. Premium and reserve risk covers uncertainties in the frequency of the occurrence of the insured events as well as in the severity of the resulting claims. Catastrophe risk predominantly relates to uncertainty around natural catastrophes. Business risk for P&C predominantly relates to unexpected increases in the expenses relating to claims handling, underwriting, and administration.\n\n## Management of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group's underwriting strategy takes advantage of the diversification of P&C risks across lines of business, customers and geographic regions. Zurich defines Group-wide governance for insurance risk including for new products. Underwriting discipline is a fundamental part of managing insurance risk. The Group sets limits on underwriting capacity and delegates authority to individuals based on their specific expertise and sets appropriate underwriting and pricing guidelines. Technical reviews assure that underwriters perform within authorities and adhere to underwriting policies.\n\nP&C insurance reserves are regularly estimated, reviewed and monitored by qualified and experienced actuaries at local, regional and Group levels. To arrive at their reserve estimates, the actuaries take into consideration, among other things, the latest available facts, trends and patterns of loss payments. Inflation is a key challenge globally, with various factors including supply chain constraints and increased energy costs having an impact on insurance losses. Inflation is monitored with insights feeding into actuarial reserving models and Zurich's underwriting processes and pricing, and the implications of a continuing high inflation environment and mitigating actions are a key focus area. The Group's existing risk management and governance processes continue to monitor and respond to the developing environment.\n\nTo ensure a common understanding of business insights and new trends for reserve analysis, financial plans, underwriting and pricing decisions, the Group has established a culture of continuous cross-functional collaboration. For this, underwriting, actuarial (pricing and reserving), claims, finance, sales and distribution, risk engineering and risk management contribute to quarterly meetings at local and Group level.\n\nZurich's Emerging and Sustainability Risk Committee - with cross-functional expertise from core insurance functions such as underwriting, claims and risk management - identifies, assesses and recommends actions for emerging risks.\n\nGovernance is in place to ensure appropriate focus on top-line targets and profitability. Reinsurance is deployed to help manage insurance risk. Group Risk Management also provides independent assurance through risk reviews.\n\nThe Group is exposed to losses that could arise from natural and man-made catastrophes. The main concentrations of risks arising from such potential catastrophes are regularly reported to executive management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Natural catastrophes\n\nThe Group uses third-party models, adjusted to Zurich's view, to manage its underwriting, ensure accumulations stay within intended exposure limits and assess the capital requirement due to natural catastrophes. Consistent with this view on natural catastrophes, Zurich performs profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocations, and chooses the type and quantity of reinsurance it buys.\n\nTo ensure global consistency, exposures to natural catastrophes are modeled by a dedicated Group function. Potential losses from property, motor and marine policies with material exposure in hazard-prone geographical areas are probabilistically modeled, as well as worker injury policies with material exposure in U.S. seismic zones. Losses for other lines of business are estimated based on adjustments to these modeled results. Risk modeling mainly addresses weather-induced perils such as wind, flood, tornado, and hail, and geological-induced perils such as earthquake. The most important peril regions for natural catastrophes are U.S. and Caribbean hurricane, California earthquake and European windstorm. The Group has internal modelling capabilities for pandemics.\n\nZurich regularly reviews and expands the scope and sophistication of its modeling and strives to improve data quality. Zurich continues to invest in a diversified, multi-vendor-based catastrophe modeling ecosystem and in expanding its catastrophe research and development capabilities to complement existing expertise in natural catastrophe risk management (e.g., risks relating to climate change).\n\nZurich supplements internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes) and is a shareholder of PERILS AG, Switzerland, a catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm. Zurich is also a member of the open-source initiative, Oasis Loss Modelling Framework.\n\n## Man-made catastrophes\n\nMan-made catastrophes include events such as industrial accidents, terrorism and cyber attacks. For terrorism, worker injury and property risk exposures are analyzed to identify areas with significant risk concentration. Other lines of business are assessed, although the potential exposure is not as significant. A vendor-provided catastrophe model is used to evaluate potential exposures in every major U.S. city. The Group's analysis for the P&C business has shown that its exposures outside of North America are lower, in a large part due to government-provided pools. Outside the modeled areas, exposure concentrations are identified in Zurich's Risk Exposure Data Store (REDS). Exposure concentrations for location-based man-made scenarios, other than terrorism, are also identified in REDS, for example, industrial explosions at global ports.\n\nThe Group uses third-party models to manage its underwriting and accumulations for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks. The Group actively monitors and manages its cyber exposure and continues to refine products to ensure their appropriateness. Improving modeling capabilities and data quality for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks are key focus areas.\n\n## Concentration of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the P&C business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios. Concentration risk for a P&C insurer may arise due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area or of underlying risks covered.\n\nTables 2.a and 2.b show the Group's concentration of risk within the P&C business by region and line of business based on direct written premiums before reinsurance. P&C premiums ceded to reinsurers (including retrocessions) amounted to USD 10.3 billion and USD 9.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Reinsurance programs are managed on a global basis, and therefore, the net premium after reinsurance is monitored on an aggregated basis. Inflation is driving exposure and rate increases in short tail lines, particularly in North America.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sensitivities do not indicate the probability of such an event and do not consider any non-linear effects of reinsurance. Based on the assumptions applied in the sensitivity analysis in tables 3.a and 3.b, each additional percentage-point increase in the loss ratio would have a linear impact on net income before tax and net assets. The Group also monitors insurance risk by evaluating extreme scenarios, taking into account the non-linear effects\n\nof reinsurance contracts.\n\n| Insurance risk  sensitivity for the   | in USD millions, for the year ended  December 31, 2022   | Europe, Middle  East & Africa   | North  America   | Asia   Pacific   | Latin   America   | Reinsurance   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|\n| Property & Casualty                   | +1% in net loss ratio                                    |                                 |                  |                  |                   |               |         |\n| business - current                    | Net income before tax                                    | (137)                           | (130)            | (27)             | (20)              | (1)           | (314)   |\n| period                                | Net assets                                               | (108)                           | (102)            | (21)             | (16)              | (1)           | (247)   |\n|                                       | Table 3.b                                                |                                 |                  |                  |                   |               |         |\n| Insurance risk  sensitivity for the   | in USD millions, for the year ended  December 31, 2021   | Europe, Middle  East & Africa   | North  America   | Asia   Pacific   | Latin   America   | Reinsurance   | Total   |\n| Property & Casualty                   | +1% in net loss ratio                                    |                                 |                  |                  |                   |               |         |\n| business - prior                      | Net income before tax                                    | (137)                           | (112)            | (25)             | (19)              | (1)           | (295)   |\n| period                                | Net assets                                               | (106)                           | (87)             | (19)             | (14)              | (1)           | (227)   |",

The actual experience may differ to that expected at the time of writing the business. For example, mortality could be either higher or lower than expected due to an unexpectedly harsh or benign flu season.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of experience differing from expectations, Zurich uses models to perform sensitivity analyses. The impact of changing the assumptions is considered under different scenarios across the risk types and products. Changes relating to absolute level and trend development in assumptions are considered by product category. For example, Zurich looks at the impact of an increase in morbidity rates for protection products or changes in the level and trend of longevity for annuity products. These analyses assist in understanding how sensitive the business is to changes in various assumptions and where there are benefits of having a diversified portfolio of risks and products. Changes in the same assumption can have a positive impact on one product and a negative impact on another. For example, people living longer than expected may have a positive impact on products that offer life cover, as claims are then paid later than expected, but could have a negative impact on annuity products as payments are made for longer than expected. At Zurich, the Life liability risks are managed through established processes with requirements described in the Zurich Risk Policy.\n\nThe Group has local product development and approval committees and a Group-level committee to review potential new life products that could significantly increase or change the nature of the risks or introduce new risks. The Group also regularly reviews the continued suitability and the potential risks of existing life products open to new business to ensure sustainability of the business.\n\nProduct pricing involves setting assumptions relating to life insurance risks. Local teams have responsibility for the pricing of the products in line with the experience and emerging trends observed in each market. The emerging experience is regularly monitored and compared against expectations. Where permitted, premiums are adjusted for factors such as age, gender, and smoker status to reflect the corresponding risks. Policy terms and conditions and disclosure requirements are designed to mitigate the risk arising from non-standard and unpredictable risks that could result in a severe financial loss.\n\nThe underwriting process forms an important part of risk management and risk selection for life insurance risks. This process is supported through setting standards in the Zurich Risk Policy and providing support through additional underwriting guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks that are inherent in these products are largely passed on to the policyholder, although a portion of the Group's management fees is linked to the value of funds under management, and hence is at risk if fund values decrease. Contracts may have minimum guaranteed death benefits where the sum at risk depends on the fair value of the underlying investments. Other life insurance liabilities include traditional life insurance products, such as protection and life annuity products.\n\nProtection products (including disability products) provide benefits linked to policyholders' life and health and mainly carry mortality and morbidity risks. Changes in medical treatments and lifestyle changes are among the most significant factors that could result in earlier or more claims than expected or customers claiming for longer than expected. Disability, when defined in terms of the ability to perform an occupation, could also be affected by adverse economic conditions. This impact could come through, for example, an increase in claims relating to mental health conditions triggered by an economic downturn.\n\nLife annuity products provide benefits that are paid to the customer either for a selected number of years, or until they die. Therefore, these products carry longevity risk as people living longer than expected can have a material impact on these products. Medical advances and improved social conditions that lead to increased longevity are significant risk drivers for these products. Annuitant (beneficiary) mortality assumptions include allowance for future mortality improvements. The trends in mortality improvements are monitored to ensure that changes in experience are considered. The exposure to longevity risk at a Group level is measured regularly and compared against the limit set by the Group.\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks posed by policyholder behavior and fluctuating expenses. These are mitigated by designing products that, as closely as possible, match revenue and expenses associated with the contract.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to investment and surrender risks related to bank-owned life insurance contracts sold in the U.S. These risks have reduced significantly in recent years as several significant policies have switched into less risky investment divisions. See heading 'Other Loans' in note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn the past, low interest rates have led to an increase in both Life business risks and Life liability risks (especially longevity risk). While interest rates have recently risen, the level of interest rates remains an important factor in the evaluation of insurance risks.\n\nFurthermore, interest rate guarantees (with concentration in traditional guaranteed business in Germany and Switzerland, and variable annuity business in the U.S. containing minimum guaranteed death benefits) expose Zurich to financial losses that may arise as a result of adverse movements in interest rates. These guarantees are managed through a combination of asset-liability management and hedging.\n\nThe Group has a dynamic hedging strategy to reduce the investment risk associated with the closed book of variable annuitants written by its U.S. subsidiary Zurich American Life Insurance Company. This exposure has fallen substantially as a result of several policy buyback programs since 2015.\n\nHigher than expected inflation could affect Life insurance business through, for example, customer affordability issues and reduced demand. The expenses to administer Life insurance business could be higher than expected, leading to higher product expense loads. This could result in a combination of higher customer premiums and reduced profitability. Potential actions to manage the effects of higher-than-expected inflation include assumption updates, customer behavior monitoring, product reviews and design and customer retention initiatives.\n\nDiversification across regions and businesses, as shown in table 4 below, contributes to reducing the impacts of the risks associated with the Life business described above.\n\n## Concentration of Life insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the Life business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios of assets or obligations. Concentration risk for a life insurer may arise with respect to investments in a geographical area, economic sector, or individual issuers, or due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area, of a product type, or of underlying risks covered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The life insurance reserves also include policyholder surplus reserves with a loss absorbing capacity \u00b9, predominantly in Germany in the amount of USD 2.5 billion in 2022 (2021: USD 9.5 billion) and in the UK in the amount of USD 0.3 billion in 2022 (2021: USD 0.5 billion). The net movement in reserves in Germany in 2022 is mainly related to an agreement entered into by the Group to sell the legacy traditional life insurance back book, which is subject to regulatory approval (see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements). The reduction in net unit-linked insurance contract reserves stems largely from the negative performance of the underlying funds and foreign exchange rate movements. The Group's exposure to life insurance risks varies significantly by geographic region and line of business and may change over time. See note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on reserves for insurance contracts.\n\n- 1 Policyholder surplus reserves with loss-absorbing capacity refer to funds allocated to the policyholders that can be used by the shareholders, and which, under certain conditions, may require regulatory approval.\n\nTable 4\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   | Unit-linked   insurance contracts   | Unit-linked   insurance contracts   | Other life   insurance liabilities   | Other life   insurance liabilities   | Total reserves   | Total reserves   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                      | 2022                                | 2021                                | 2022                                 | 2021                                 | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Life                                 |                                     |                                     |                                      |                                      |                  |                  |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa         | 39,777                              | 51,005                              | 43,895                               | 78,194                               | 83,672           | 129,199          |\n| of which:                            |                                     |                                     |                                      |                                      |                  |                  |\n| United Kingdom                       | 11,605                              | 15,700                              | 3,600                                | 4,116                                | 15,205           | 19,816           |\n| Germany                              | 17,415                              | 22,757                              | 9,670                                | 38,155                               | 27,085           | 60,912           |\n| Switzerland                          | 1,025                               | 1,148                               | 15,534                               | 17,069                               | 16,559           | 18,216           |\n| Italy                                | 4,351                               | 4,071                               | 2,948                                | 3,227                                | 7,299            | 7,297            |\n| Ireland                              | 52                                  | 976                                 | 1,547                                | 2,052                                | 1,599            | 3,028            |\n| Spain                                | 501                                 | 602                                 | 8,841                                | 11,428                               | 9,342            | 12,031           |\n| Zurich International                 | 4,451                               | 5,298                               | 230                                  | 235                                  | 4,680            | 5,532            |\n| Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa | 378                                 | 454                                 | 1,526                                | 1,913                                | 1,904            | 2,367            |\n| North America                        | 12,187                              | 11,749                              | 1,391                                | 1,297                                | 13,578           | 13,046           |\n| Asia Pacific                         | 644                                 | 703                                 | 4,139                                | 4,467                                | 4,782            | 5,170            |\n| Latin America                        | 16,012                              | 13,516                              | 5,738                                | 5,068                                | 21,750           | 18,585           |\n| Group Reinsurance                    | -

In addition, it supports the Group Underwriting strategy and risk appetite. The Group follows a centralized reinsurance purchasing strategy for both P&C and Life, and bundles programs, where appropriate, to benefit from diversification and economies of scale. In support of the Group's empowerment-based management model and to align risk-bearing capacities between the Group and individual country operations, internal reinsurance applies to all externally reinsured lines of business. The Group has specific facultative property and casualty reinsurance facilities to actively manage and reduce potential claims-recovery risks on facultative cessions and to support the strategy on operational excellence.\n\nThe Group structures and aligns its external reinsurance protection to its capital position to achieve an optimal risk-return ratio. This includes participation in the underlying risks through self-retentions in line with the risk appetite of each line of business. The cession rate for P&C was 23.7 percent (14.7 percent excluding captives, unaudited) as of December 31, 2022 and 23.0 percent (14.2 percent excluding captives, unaudited) as of December 31, 2021. The cession rate for Life was 9.3 percent as of December 31, 2022 and 10.8 percent as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Group uses traditional and collateralized reinsurance markets to protect itself against extreme single events, multiple event occurrences across regions, and increased frequency of events.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group reviews its reinsurance programs on an annual basis to reflect its risk appetite and market conditions. In 2022, the Group purchased:\n\n- - Several regional catastrophe treaties.\n- - A global property catastrophe treaty which was renewed on April 1, 2022, for a further three years\n- - A global aggregate catastrophe treaty\n\nAll natural catastrophe reinsurance treaties are on a loss-occurrence basis, except for the global aggregate catastrophe treaty, which operates on an annual aggregate basis.\n\nIn addition to these covers, the Group has a bilateral risk swap, and various line of business-specific risk treaties. These covers are reviewed continuously and are subject to change in the future.\n\nTo complement existing treaties, the Group purchases catastrophe reinsurance specific to life insurance for its exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes.\n\nThe reinsurance market continues to be challenging with reinsurers continuing to increase rates across most regions and lines of business. Property catastrophe and property per risk treaties are under the most pricing pressure. While reinsurance capacity has broadly been available, reinsurers are actively differentiating the best and most sophisticated insurance companies through their deployment of capacity. Strategic partnerships and long-term relationships continue to provide an effective path for Zurich to execute on its reinsurance strategy.\n\n## Catastrophe reinsurance treaties\n\nin USD millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Global aggregate cat treaty renewed on January 1, 2022; US treaties renewed per April 1 2022; Global all perils cat treaty renewed on April 1, 2022 for a three year period; International & Europe all perils cat treaty renewed July 1, 2022.

Risk factors include:\n\n- - Equity market price changes.\n- - Real estate market price changes.\n- - Interest rate changes.\n- - Credit and swap spread changes.\n- - Defaults of issuers.\n- - Changes in currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Group manages the market risk of assets relative to liabilities on an economic total balance sheet basis. This is done to achieve the maximum risk-adjusted excess return on assets relative to the liability benchmark, while also taking into account the Group's risk tolerance and local regulatory constraints.\n\nThe Group has policies and limits to manage market risk and keep its strategic asset allocation in line with its risk capacity. Zurich centrally manages certain asset classes to control aggregation of risk and provides a consistent approach to constructing portfolios and selecting external asset managers. It diversifies portfolios, investments and asset managers, and regularly measures and manages market risk exposure. The Group defines limits on concentration of investments in single issuers and certain asset classes, as well as the degree to which asset interest rate sensitivities may deviate from liability interest rate sensitivities. The Group regularly reviews its capacity to hold illiquid investments.\n\nThe Asset/Liability Management Investment Committee reviews and monitors the Group strategic asset allocation and tactical boundaries, and monitors Group asset/liability exposure. The Group oversees the activities of local asset/liability management investment committees and regularly assesses market risks at both Group and local business levels. The economic effect of potential extreme market moves is regularly examined and considered when setting the asset allocation.\n\nRisk assessment reviews include the analysis of the management of interest rate risk for each major maturity bucket and adherence to the aggregate positions with risk limits. The Group follows processes to manage market risks and to analyze market risk hotspots. Actions to mitigate risks are taken, if necessary, to manage fluctuations affecting asset/ liability mismatch and risk-based capital.\n\nThe Group may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate market risks arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, from credit quality of assets, and from commitments to third parties. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments mostly for economic hedging purposes and, in limited circumstances, the instruments may also meet the definition of an effective hedge for accounting purposes.\n\nIn compliance with Swiss insurance regulation, the Group's policy prohibits speculative trading in derivatives, meaning a pattern of so-called 'in-and-out trading' activity without any reference to an underlying position. The Group addresses the risks arising from derivatives through a stringent policy that requires approval of a derivative program before transactions are initiated, and by subsequent regular monitoring by Group Risk Management of open positions and annual reviews of derivative programs.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investment result, including impairments and the treatment of selected financial instruments, see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.

These could affect the Group's liquidity, reported income, economic surplus and regulatory capital position. Equity risk exposure includes common stocks (including equity unit trusts), private equity, common stock portfolios backing participating-with-profit policyholder contracts, and equities held for employee benefit plans. Exposure to real estate risk includes direct holdings in property and property company shares and funds. Returns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, may be exposed to risks from equity and real estate, but these risks are borne by policyholders. The Group is however indirectly exposed to market movements from unit-linked contracts with respect to both earnings and economic capital; market movements affect the amount of fee income earned when the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base. Therefore, the value of in-force business for unit-linked business can be negatively affected by adverse movements in equity and real estate markets.\n\nThe Group manages its risks related to equity securities and real estate as part of the overall investment risk management process and applies limits as expressed in policies and guidelines. Specifically, Zurich limits holdings in equities, real estate and alternative investments. To realize an optimal level of risk diversification, the strategy for equities is defined through a composite of market benchmark indices. The Group has the capability and processes in place to change the exposure to key equity markets via the use of derivatives or purchase or sale of securities within a short time frame.\n\nFor additional information on equity securities and investment property, see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk from interest rates and credit spreads\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of an adverse economic impact resulting from changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Yield curve changes affect the value of interest rate-sensitive investments and derivatives as well as the fair value of insurance liabilities. Other balance sheet items, such as liability investment contracts, debt issued by the Group, commercial and residential mortgages, employee benefit plans, loans and receivables, are also affected.\n\nThe Group manages credit spread risk, which is the variation in economic value due to changes in the level or the volatility of credit spreads over the risk-free interest rate. Movements of credit spreads are driven by several factors including changes in expected default probability, default losses, risk premium, liquidity and other effects.\n\nReturns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, are at the risk of the policyholder; however, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads insofar as they affect the amount of fee income earned if the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a 50 bps decrease in interest rates, the sensitivity was USD 3.5 billion in 2022 (USD 6.7 billion as of 2021). For a 10 percent decline in equity markets, Group investments drop in value by USD 0.9 billion in 2022 compared with USD 1.3 billion as of 2021. A 100 bps increase in credit spreads resulted in a decrease of USD 3.5 billion in 2022 compared with USD 6.2 billion as of 2021. When compared to prior year, higher interest rates, implementation of market risk mitigation actions, and the disposal of Life back books have reduced the Group's exposure to a drop in interest rates.\n\nThe following describes limitations of the Group investment sensitivities. Group sensitivities show the effects of a change of certain risk factors, while other assumptions remain unchanged. The interest rate scenarios assume a parallel shift of all interest rates in the respective currencies. They do not take account of the possibility that interest rate changes might differ by rating class; these are disclosed separately as credit spread risk sensitivities.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on economic assets, and not on shareholders' equity or net income as set out in the consolidated financial statements. The sensitivities only cover Group investments and do not cover insurance or other liabilities. The equity market scenarios assume a concurrent movement of all stock markets. The sensitivity analysis does not take account of actions that might be taken to mitigate losses. Actions may involve changing the asset allocation, for example through selling and buying assets. Sensitivity calculations do not assign a probability to the scenario considered. The sensitivities do not indicate a probability of such events occurring in the future. They do not necessarily represent the Group's view of expected future market changes.\n\nIn addition to the gross sensitivities, management uses sensitivities and stress scenarios to assess the impact of market movements on the Group's net assets. For more information on sensitivities see 'Group economic net asset sensitivities' (unaudited), below.\n\n## Group economic net asset sensitivities\n\nThe following section presents the sensitivities of Group economic net assets under Swiss Solvency Test (SST) assumptions with respect to certain standard financial market scenarios.\n\nThe net asset impact - the difference between the impact on Group investments and liabilities - represents the economic risk related to changes in market risk factors to which the Group is exposed. Tables 5, 6 and 7 show the estimated economic market risk sensitivities of the net asset impact. Positive values represent an increase in the net assets, and values in parentheses represent a decrease. Mismatches in changes in value of assets relative to liabilities represent an economic risk to the Group.\n\nIn determining the sensitivities, investments and liabilities are fully re-valued under the given scenarios. Each instrument is re-valued separately, taking relevant product features into account. Non-linear valuation effects, where they exist, are reflected in the calculations. The sensitivities are shown before tax.\n\nThe basis of the presentation for tables 5, 6, and 7 is an economic valuation represented by the fair value of Group investments. IFRS insurance liabilities are discounted at risk-free market rates to reflect the present value of insurance liability cash flows and other liabilities, for example, own debt. The Group uses FINMA allowed risk-free curves for discounting. In the sensitivities, own debt does not include subordinated debt, which Zurich considers available to protect policyholders in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe basis of presentation for the Life business to financial market movements uses replicating portfolios calibrated according to the methodology and cashflow models approved by FINMA. The replicating portfolios are portfolios of assets that replicate the cash flows or present values of the life insurance liabilities under stochastic scenarios from the local life valuation models. They are calibrated to match dependencies of life insurance liabilities on financial market developments in respect of interest rates, equity and property. The options and guarantees of the underlying life insurance liabilities are captured through the inclusion of options in the replicating portfolios.\n\nSensitivities are shown split by segment and for economic net assets net of minority interest. The heading 'Rest of the business' includes Farmers, Group Finance and Operations and Non-Core Businesses. No allowance has been made in the economic asset sensitivities for the sale of the German traditional life insurance back book, which is subject to regulatory approval.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Default risk is controlled by Group counterparty concentration risk limits which aim to keep the size of potential losses to an acceptable level.\n\nTable 8\n\nTable 8 shows the credit risk exposure of debt securities, by credit rating.

Limits tighten progressively for lower-rated exposures. Where the Group identifies investments that are expected to trigger limit breaches, appropriate mitigating actions are implemented.\n\nThe risk-weighted average credit rating of the Group's debt securities portfolio is 'A-' in 2022, unchanged from 2021.\n\n## Debt securities - credit risk concentration by industry in %, as of December 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the largest concentration in the Group's debt securities portfolio was government related at 48 percent of all debt securities.

The Group also maintains an authorized list of acceptable cash counterparties.\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 7.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and USD 8.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. The risk-weighted average rating of the overall cash portfolio was 'A-' as of December 31, 2022 and 'A-' as of December 31, 2021. The ten largest bank exposures represent 52 percent of the total cash and cash equivalents amount, of which the risk-weighted average rating was 'A' as of December 31, 2022 and 'AA-' as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Mortgage loans and other loans\n\nMortgage loans amounted to USD 5.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and USD 6.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The Group's largest mortgage loan portfolios are held in Switzerland (USD 2.9 billion) and in Germany (USD 0.9 billion); these are predominantly secured against residential property but also include mortgages secured by commercial property. The Group invests in mortgages in the U.S. (USD 0.5 billion); these are mainly participations in large mortgage loans secured against commercial property.\n\nThe credit risk arising from other loans is assessed and monitored together with the debt securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, USD 0.7 billion were rated as 'AAA' (21 percent) compared with USD 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2021; USD 0.0 billion as 'AA' (0 percent) compared with USD 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021; USD 1.2 billion as 'A' (36 percent) compared with USD 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021; USD 1.5 billion as 'BBB' and below (44 percent) compared with USD 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021; and USD 0.0 billion as unrated (0 percent) compared with USD 0.0 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe replacement value of outstanding derivatives represents a credit risk to the Group. These instruments include interest rate and cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and purchased options. A potential exposure could also arise from possible changes in replacement values. The Group regularly monitors credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions. Outstanding positions with external counterparties are managed through an approval process embedded in derivative programs.\n\nTo limit credit risk, derivative financial instruments are executed with counterparties rated 'BBB' or higher as per Zurich Risk Policy requirements. The Group's standard practice is to only transact derivatives with those counterparties for which the Group has in place an ISDA Master Agreement, with a Credit Support Annex. This mitigates credit exposures from over-the-counter transactions due to close-out netting and requires the counterparty to post collateral when the derivative position exceeds an agreed threshold. The Group further mitigates credit exposures from derivative transactions by using exchange-traded or centrally cleared instruments whenever possible. From September 1, 2022, the Group was in scope of the initial margin requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\n## Risk from currency exchange rates\n\nCurrency risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in exchange rates. The Group operates internationally and therefore is exposed to the financial impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies. The Group's presentation currency is the U.S. dollar, but its assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in many currencies, with significant amounts in euro, Swiss franc, British pound and U.S. dollar. On entity balance sheets a currency mismatch may cause a balance sheet's net asset value to fluctuate, either through income or directly through equity. The Group manages this risk by matching foreign currency positions on entity balance sheets within prescribed limits. Residual entity mismatches are reported centrally to make use of the netting effect across the Group. Zurich hedges these residual entity mismatches within an established limit through a central balance sheet. For information on net gains/losses on foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated income statements, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The monetary currency risk exposure on entity balance sheets is considered immaterial.\n\nDifferences arise when functional currencies are translated into the Group's presentation currency, the U.S. dollar. The Group applies net investment hedge accounting to protect against the impact that changes in certain exchange rates might have on selected net investments.\n\nTable 9 shows the sensitivity of total IFRS equity to changes in exchange rates for the main functional currencies to which the Group is exposed. Positive values represent an increase in the value of the Group's total equity. See notes 1, 3 and 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on foreign currency translation and transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They do not necessarily represent\n\nZurich's view of expected future market changes. While table 9 shows the effect of a 10 percent increase in currency exchange rates, a decrease of 10 percent would have the converse effect.\n\n## Other credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk associated with a loss or potential loss from counterparties failing to fulfill their financial obligations. See section 'risks from defaults of counterparties' for market risk-related asset categories. The Group's exposure to other credit risk is derived from the following main categories of assets:\n\n- - Reinsurance assets.\n- - Receivables.\n\nThe Group's objective in managing credit risk exposures is to maintain them within parameters that reflect the Group's strategic objectives, and its risk appetite and tolerance. Sources of credit risk are assessed and monitored, and the Group has policies to manage specific risks within various subcategories of credit risk. To assess counterparty credit risk, the Group uses ratings assigned by external rating agencies, qualified third parties, such as asset managers, and internal rating assessments. If the ratings of external rating agencies differ, the Group generally applies the lowest, unless other indicators justify an alternative, which may be an internal credit rating.\n\nThe Group actively uses collateral to mitigate credit risks. Underlying credit risks are managed independently from the collateral. The Group has limits and quality criteria to identify acceptable letter of credit providers. Letters of credit enable Zurich to limit the risks embedded in reinsurance, captives, deductible programs, trade credit and surety.\n\nThe Group has counterparty limits which are regularly monitored. Exposure to counterparties' parent companies and subsidiaries is aggregated to include reinsurance assets, investments, derivatives, and certain insurance products. Group aggregate concentration limits and relevant exception approvals are monitored in line with risk policy requirements.\n\nOn-balance sheet exposures are the main source of credit risk. Off-balance sheet credit exposures are related primarily to certain insurance products, reinsurance and collateral used to protect underlying credit exposures on the balance sheet. The Group has no material amount of off-balance sheet exposures related to undrawn loan commitments as of December 31, 2022. See note 22 of the consolidated financial statements for undrawn loan commitments.",

The Group typically only cedes new business to authorized reinsurers with a minimum rating of 'A-.' Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 60 percent was collateralized as of December 31, 2022 and 54 percent as of December 31, 2021. Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 57 percent was ceded to captive insurance companies in 2022, and 66 percent in 2021.\n\nReinsurance assets included reinsurance recoverables (the reinsurers' share of reserves for insurance contracts) of USD 25.7 billion and USD 25.7 billion, and receivables arising from ceded reinsurance of USD 1.9 billion and USD 1.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, gross of allowance for impairment. Reserves for potentially uncollectible reinsurance assets amounted to USD 117 million as of December 31, 2022 and USD 119 million as of December 31, 2021. The Group's policy on impairment charges takes into account both specific charges for known situations (e.g., financial distress or litigation) and a general, prudent provision for unanticipated impairments.\n\nReinsurance assets in table 10 are shown before taking into account collateral such as cash or bank letters of credit and deposits received under ceded reinsurance contracts. Unsecured reinsurance assets shown are after deducting collateral. Bank issuing letters of credit for the benefit of Zurich are, on average, 'A' rated. The value of the collateral received amounts to USD 10.9 billion and USD 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nTable 10 shows reinsurance assets and unsecured reinsurance assets split by rating.\n\nTable 10\n\n| as of December 31   | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             | 2022 2021             |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                     | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance |\n|                     | Reinsurance assets    | Reinsurance assets    |                       | assets                | Reinsurance assets    | Reinsurance assets    |                       | assets                |\n|                     | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  |\n|                     | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 |\n| Rating              |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| AAA                 | 13                    | 0.1%                  | 13                    | 0.1%                  | 26                    | 0.1%                  | 26                    | 0.2%                  |\n| AA                  | 7,681                 | 28.0%                 | 6,981                 | 42.0%                 | 8,267                 | 30.3%                 | 7,525                 | 45.2%                 |\n| A                   | 13,408                | 48.7%                 | 6,619                 | 39.9%                 | 11,461                | 42.1%                 | 5,630                 | 33.8%                 |\n| BBB                 | 2,928                 | 10.7%                 | 1,475                 | 8.9%                  | 3,604                 | 13.2%                 | 1,642                 | 9.9%                  |\n| BB                  | 544                   | 2.0%                  | 241                   | 1.5%                  | 652                   | 2.4%                  | 324                   | 1.9%                  |\n| B and below         | 175                   | 0.6%                  | 60                    | 0.4%                  | 206                   | 0.8%                  | 77                    | 0.5%                  |\n| Unrated             | 2,731                 | 9.9%                  | 1,199                 | 7.2%                  | 3,020                 | 11.1%                 | 1,416                 | 8.5%                  |\n| Total               | 27,480                | 100.0%                | 16,588                | 100.0%                | 27,236                | 100.0%                | 16,640                | 100.0%                |\n\n## Credit risk related to receivables\n\nThe largest amount of the Group's credit risk exposure to receivables is related to third-party agents, brokers and other intermediaries. The Group has policies and standards to manage and monitor credit risk related to intermediaries.\n\nThe Group reports internally on Group past-due receivable balances and strives to keep the balance of past-due positions as low as possible.\n\nReceivables from ceded reinsurance are part of reinsurance assets and managed accordingly. See notes 15 and 24 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on receivables.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss, adverse reputational, legal or regulatory impact, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, systems or from external events, including external fraud, catastrophes, or failure in outsourcing arrangements. Zurich has a framework to identify, assess, manage, monitor, and report operational risk within the Group. Within this framework, the Group:\n\n- - Uses a scenario-based approach to assess, model and quantify the capital required for operational risk for business units under extreme circumstances. This approach allows information to be compared across the Group and highlights the main scenarios contributing to the capital required under Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM).\n- - Documents and reviews operational events exceeding a threshold determined by the Zurich Risk Policy. Remedial action is taken to avoid the recurrence of such operational events.\n- - Conducts risk assessments where operational risks are identified for key business areas. Risks identified and assessed to be above a certain threshold must have a risk response. Risk mitigation plans are documented and tracked on an ongoing basis. In the assessments, the Group uses sources of information such as the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process, internal control assessments, and audit findings, as well as scenario modeling and operational event data.\n\nThe Group has specific processes and systems in place to focus on high-priority operational matters such as managing information security and business resilience (see sub-section 'risk focus specific to digital transformation'), as well as combating fraud.\n\nPreventing, detecting and responding to fraud are embedded in Zurich's business processes. Both claims and non-claims fraud are included in the common framework for assessing and managing operational risks. For Zurich's internal model calculations, claims fraud is part of insurance risk and non-claims fraud is part of operational risk.\n\n## Risk focus specific to digital transformation\n\nDigital and technological advances have not only created a wide spectrum of benefits for society but also amplified the associated risks. Organizations are realigning their operations, forging new third-party relationships and putting data at the heart of their decision-making and analysis. All of this is happening at a rapid pace and against a backdrop of an increasingly hostile cyber threat landscape. In order to succeed, organizations need to be able to assess and understand the risks inherent in this changing environment and ensure that they are managed appropriately.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group assesses and monitors exposure to defined information security and cyber, third-party and business resilience risk scenarios through key risk indicators (KRIs) to effectively focus on actions and adequate resource allocation.\n\n## Data risk\n\nThe strategic relevance of data as a business asset is rising at a rapid pace and the risks associated with data management are becoming more and more prominent. Preventing risks such as data losses and privacy breaches and assessing and monitoring the potential misuse of data and losses triggered by failures in data management remain in focus. Specifically, appropriate governance of data for business purposes and decision-making processes, including automation, machine-learning techniques and other advanced technologies, remains a priority. As Zurich strives to inspire confidence in a digital society with its data commitment, assurance on the ethical use of advanced technologies is provided from a risk management perspective for the protection and privacy of data of our customers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe relevance of technological risks, such as cyber risk, is rapidly increasing across all data-driven industries. Exposure to these risks has grown in lockstep with the significant rise in digital services provided directly to customers and the increasing prevalence of digital ecosystems and cloud solutions in today's interconnected world.\n\n## Third-party risk\n\nOutsourcing and engagement with third parties introduces risks relevant to the delivery of our strategy, such as data loss or disclosure, disruption to critical customer services and regulatory compliance. Digitalization has accelerated the complexity and changes to the Group's third-party ecosystem. The Group addresses risks associated with third-party engagements along its supply and value chain. Applying a consistent Group-wide approach to third-party governance is among Zurich's key priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, increasing automation of processes, development of advanced analytics capabilities, and fragmented supply chains have contributed to an increasingly complex operating environment. In response to these challenges, and to better protect the interests of stakeholders, the Group continues to evolve its business resilience capability through a number of ongoing initiatives in relation to the protection and recovery of critical services and enhancing transparency around any associated risks such as pandemics, technology failure, and potential supply chain/power interruptions.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nThe Group considers internal controls to be essential for managing operational risk. The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management and internal control frameworks. The objectives of the Group's internal control system are to provide reasonable assurance that Zurich's consolidated financial statements and disclosures are materially correct, support reliable operations, and ensure legal and regulatory compliance. The internal control system is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate risks that could impact the achievement of business objectives.\n\nThe Group promotes risk awareness and understanding of controls through communication and training. Risk management and internal control systems are designed at Group level and implemented across the Group. Management, as the first line of defense, is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risk, and designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls. Testing effectiveness of relevant internal controls by the first line of defense, with second line oversight, also forms part of the control life cycle.\n\nKey processes and controls in the organization are subject to review and challenge by all three lines of defense. The second and third lines of defense regularly report on observations, conclusions and recommendations that arise from their independent reviews of internal controls. Control issues of Group-level significance and associated mitigation actions are reported regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board. The Risk and Investment Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system, including the Group's risk tolerance and enterprise-wide risk governance framework, in accordance with the charter for each committee.\n\nThe Group's Disclosure Committee, chaired by the Head of Group Financial Accounting and Reporting, reviews the accuracy, completeness and timeliness and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements of external disclosures and the effectiveness of the respective internal controls. The conclusions result in a recommendation to the Group Chief Financial Officer to release the disclosures to the Audit Committee of the Board, who may then challenge the disclosures further. The Board reviews and approves the announcement of the results and the annual report before they are made public.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich's policy is to maintain adequate liquidity and contingent liquidity to meet its liquidity needs under normal conditions and in times of stress. To achieve this, the Group assesses, monitors and manages its liquidity needs on an ongoing basis.\n\nGroup-wide liquidity management policies and specific guidelines govern how entities plan, manage and report their entity liquidity and include regular stress tests for all major legal entities and branches within the Group. The stress tests use a standardized set of internally defined stress events, and are designed to provide an overview of the potential drain on liquidity should the Group have to recapitalize entity balance sheets. Similar guidelines apply at the Group level, and detailed liquidity forecasts are regularly conducted, based on entities' input and the Group's forecasts. As part of its liquidity management, the Group maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents and high-quality, liquid investment portfolios to meet outflows under expected and stressed conditions.\n\nThe Group also maintains internal liquidity sources that cover the potential liquidity needs within the Group, including those that might arise in times of stress. The Group takes into account the amount, availability and speed at which these sources can be accessed. The Group has access to diverse funding sources to cover contingencies, including asset sales, external debt issuance and making use of committed borrowing facilities or letters of credit. The Group maintains a range of maturities for external debt securities. A potential source of liquidity risk is the effect of a downgrade of the credit rating of the Group. This could affect the Group's commitments and guarantees, potentially increasing liquidity needs. This risk - and mitigating actions that might be employed - are assessed on an ongoing basis within the Group's liquidity framework.\n\nThe Group regularly analyzes the liquidity of the investment assets and ensures that the liquidity of assets stays in line with liquidity requirements. In 2022, the Group's holdings in illiquid assets were within its capacity.\n\nFor more information on debt obligation maturities, see note 18 of the consolidated financial statements, and for information on commitments and guarantees, see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's ongoing liquidity monitoring includes regular reporting to the executive management and quarterly reporting to the Risk and Investment Committee of the Board, covering aspects such as the Group's actual and forecast liquidity, possible adverse scenarios that could affect the Group's liquidity and possible liquidity needs from the Group's main subsidiaries, including under conditions of stress.\n\nFor more information on the Group's other financial liabilities, see note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. See note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for information on the maturity of debt securities.\n\nThe Group has committed to contribute capital to subsidiaries and third parties that engage in making investments in direct private equity and private equity funds. Commitments may be called by the counterparty during the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis. See note 22 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of the annual assessment of strategic risks, the Executive Committee assesses potential risks from both external and internal factors, looking at the current year and beyond. The Executive Committee members define actions to respond as appropriate and review changes to the key risks and their status of actions at least quarterly.\n\nThe Group evaluates the risks of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions both from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The Group conducts risk assessments of M&A transactions to evaluate risks specifically related to integrating acquired businesses.\n\n## Risks to the Group's reputation\n\nRisks include acts or omissions by the Group or any of its employees that could damage the Group's reputation or lead to a loss of trust among its stakeholders. Every risk type has potential consequences for Zurich's reputation. Effectively managing each risk type supports preventing adverse reputational outcomes.\n\nThe Group aims to preserve its reputation by:\n\n- - Adhering to applicable laws and regulations.\n- - Following the core values and principles of the Group's code of conduct that promote integrity and good business practice.\n- - Living up to its sustainability commitments.\n\nThe Group centrally manages certain aspects of risk to reputation, for example, communications, through functions with the appropriate expertise. Potential risks to Zurich's reputation are included in its risk assessment processes and tools, including the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nZurich's ambition is to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. Trends like globalization, the mobility of talent and funds, shifting geopolitics, reskilling for a digital workplace, demographics, and climate change all pose immensely complex social issues.\n\nSustainability means doing business today in a way that safeguards the future of our company and our society. Sustainability risks and opportunities emanate both from effects that environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges have on the company, as well as from how the company handles its positive or negative impact on ESG issues. To protect against financial and reputational impacts, both perspectives are included in the identification and assessment of sustainability issues.\n\nClimate change, as one of the most complex risks facing society today, is intergenerational, international and interdependent. As a global insurer, Zurich faces risks from climate change and discloses its climate risk in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nSustainability topics associated with ESG challenges are also becoming more complex and interconnected as a result of these trends. Insurers are increasingly becoming agents of change and playing a more impactful role in addressing sustainability risk.\n\nZurich works with its customers and investee companies to support responsible and sustainable business practices while promoting best practices in managing ESG risks. The Group has policies in place that define the sustainability positions for which Zurich has no underwriting or investment appetite. Zurich continuously works to develop relevant products and services that help solve the most pressing societal and environmental issues of today.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group Chief Executive Officer approves position statements, recommended business actions, and reputational management considerations.\n- - Implementation: Implement mitigation actions, including managing reputational impacts locally in the businesses. Mobilize expert support available across the Group and escalate as necessary, according to governance procedures.\n\nZurich applies these steps across portfolios based on stated thresholds and verified data. Wherever possible, Zurich engages and works together with customers on the margins of Zurich's thresholds to ensure responsible and sustainable business practices. This engagement may be short, or in some cases, last up to two years, depending on which part of the renewal cycle customers are in and the time required for them to demonstrate credible progress on ESG issues.\n\nClear roles and responsibilities, starting with the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and Zurich management, support effective oversight and action with respect to climate change and other sustainability risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gross written premiums grew 14 percent on a like-for-like 1 basis with strong growth in our commercial and retail insurance business supported by continuing price increases of 6 percent over the year.\n\nThe combined ratio remained at a strong level of 94.3 percent versus the prior year. Higher earned rate and margin expansion in the commercial business as well as lower catastrophe and weather-related claims were offset by the inflationary environment experienced within the retail business. Favorable prior year development of 2.0 percent was in line with the upper end of the indicated 1-2 percent range, demonstrating the strength of the Group's reserves.\n\nThe Group's Life business delivered another excellent performance, reflecting the success of the Group's strategy to focus on protection and unit-linked business. Life BOP increased 8 percent in the year despite adverse financial market volatility and unfavorable currency movements due to U.S. dollar appreciation against other major currencies.\n\nThe Farmers Exchanges 2 showed continued progress resulting in gross written premium growth of 9 percent, benefiting from the inclusion of the MetLife business as well as rate-driven growth. Farmers BOP increased 18 percent over the prior year period driven by a 13 percent increase in BOP at Farmers Management Services due to higher feebased income and a strong improvement in the Farmers Life BOP compared with the prior year.\n\n## Robust balance sheet and higher cash generation\n\nThe Group remains committed to making the best use of capital. The Group's balance sheet remained very strong with the Swiss Solvency Test (SST) 2 ratio at an estimated 265 percent, well above the Group's target of 160 percent or above.\n\nConversion of earnings into distributable cashflow resulted in USD 4.6 billion of cash remittances over the year driven both by operational earnings and remittances of excess capital from previously retained earnings. Cumulative cash remittances of USD 12.4 billion in the 2020-2022 period were well above the target of more than USD 11.5 billion.\n\n## Dividend proposal of CHF 24\n\nIn line with our dividend policy, the Board proposes a 9 percent dividend increase to CHF 24 per share.\n\nGeorge Quinn Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 In local currency and after adjusting for closed acquisitions and disposals.\n- 2  The Farmers Exchanges are owned by the policyholders. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchange as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services.\n- 3  Estimated Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio, calculated based on the Group's internal model approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA. The SST ratio as of January 1 has to be filed with FINMA by end of April each year and is subject to review by FINMA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n233",

This was supported by the absence of COVID-19 claims, which amounted to USD 76 million in 2021. Adjusted for COVID-19 claims and the disposal of the Italian life back book, BOP was 1 percent below the previous year, with growth in local currencies offset by adverse currency movements. The result also reflects the impact of adverse market movements, mainly related to accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs which were more than offset by the favorable impact of management actions.\n\nIn Latin America, BOP rose 75 percent to USD 388 million on a reported basis. This was driven by higher investment income, profitable growth and a reduction of COVID-19 claims to USD 10 million in 2022 from USD 115 million in 2021.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, BOP decreased by 5 percent to USD 331 million on a reported basis. In 2022, the business recorded USD 46 million of COVID-19 claims, mainly driven by hospitalization benefits in Japan, whereas no material COVID-19 impact was recorded in 2021. Adjusting for COVID-19 claims, BOP increased 7 percent, as the net favorable impact of assumption updates, reserve releases and underlying growth was only partially offset by adverse currency movements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

COVID-19 claims did not have a material impact, in line with the prior year.\n\nNet inflows of USD 4.7 billion were 21 percent lower than in the prior year on a reported basis, driven primarily by EMEA which reported net outflows in the second half of 2022.\n\nAssets under management (AuM) decreased 21 percent in 2022 to USD 232 billion. Net inflows increased AuM by around 2 percent. The announced sale of a German legacy life insurance back book led to the reclassification of USD 21 billion of AuM into assets held for sale. Unfavorable financial market movements and adverse currency movements further reduced AuM by USD 35 billion and USD 12 billion, respectively.\n\n| in USD millions, for the years ended December 31   |   New business value, |   New business value, | New business  annual premium  equivalent (APE)  2   | New business  annual premium  equivalent (APE)  2   | New business  margin, after tax (as % of APE) (NBM)  3   | New business  margin, after tax (as % of APE) (NBM)  3   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                    |                  2022 |                  2021 | 2022                                                | 2021                                                | 2022                                                     | 2021                                                     |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)                |                   557 |                   668 | 2,130                                               | 2,465                                               | 27.1%                                                    | 28.6%                                                    |\n| North America                                      |                     9 |                    24 | 108                                                 | 120                                                 | 8.4%                                                     | 19.8%                                                    |\n| Asia Pacific                                       |                    49 |                   103 | 206                                                 | 198                                                 | 24.1%                                                    | 52.7%                                                    |\n| Latin America                                      |                   146 |                   164 | 1,111                                               | 1,041                                               | 20.7%                                                    | 25.5%                                                    |\n| Total                                              |                   761 |                   959 | 3,555                                               | 3,824                                               | 24.8%                                                    | 29.1%                                                    |\n\n- 1 New business value is calculated on embedded value principles net of non-controlling interests.\n- 2   APE is shown gross of non-controlling interests.\n- 3   New business margin is calculated using new business value as a percentage of APE based on figures net of non-controlling interests for both metrics.\n\nIn 2022, Life new business annual premium equivalent (APE) increased 1 percent on a like-for-like basis. Growth was driven by higher sales in capital efficient savings and protection products. On a reported basis, APE declined 7 percent, with local currency growth offset by U.S. dollar appreciation against other major currencies.\n\nIn EMEA, APE sales reduced by 3 percent on a like-for-like basis, compared with 2021. This was primarily driven by a reduction of low-margin individual savings in Spain and a slowdown of unit-linked sales in the second half of 2022, partially offset by growth in corporate savings in Switzerland.\n\nAPE sales in Latin America increased 8 percent on a like-for-like basis, driven by growth in protection in the Zurich branded businesses.\n\nIn North America, APE sales decreased 10 percent on a like-for-like basis, driven by underwriting actions implemented in the second half of the year.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, APE sales increased by 14 percent on a like-for-like basis, driven by growth in the second half of 2022, benefiting from higher protection sales in Japan and Australia.\n\nThe new business margin (NBM) remained attractive at 24.8 percent, down from 29.1 percent in the previous year. The lower margin reflects the impact of modelling and assumption updates, a less favorable product mix within Zurich's preferred lines, as well as adverse economic variances mainly related to higher discount rates. This resulted in new business value (NBV) of USD 761 million, 15 percent below the prior-year period on a like-for-like basis.\n\n## NBV, APE and NBM by segment",

Investment property valuation increased by USD 728 million, driven by revaluation to reflect latest market conditions and completion of construction projects.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition of the network of Financial Advisors of the Deutsche Bank Group by the Group through its subsidiary Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A increased the goodwill by USD 211 million.\n\nThe Group also reclassified about USD 857 million of assets and liabilities as held for sale reflecting the sale of the German Life back book (subject to regulatory approvals) and other capital optimization actions. These factors, including a reduction in liabilities related to insurance reserves and redemption of debt, also drove a decrease in the total liabilities for the Group to USD 349 billion in 2022 from USD 397 billion in 2021.\n\n## Group assets\n\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2022 (in USD millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders' equity:\n\nThe shareholders' equity of the Group of USD 26.6 billion decreased USD 11.2 billion from USD 37.9 billion at year-end 2021, primarily due to the net unrealized losses on investment compared to net unrealized gains at year-end 2021, unfavorable currency movements and the payment of the Group dividend of USD 3.5 billion, which were partially offset by net income attributable to shareholders of USD 4.6 billion. Net unrealized losses on Group investments included in shareholders' equity were USD 6.8 billion pre-tax, compared to net unrealized gains of USD 4.1 billion at year-end 2021, driven by adverse market conditions.\n\n## Treasury and capital management\n\nThe Group's balance sheet remains very strong, as demonstrated by S&P and Moody's financial strength ratings for the Zurich Insurance Company Ltd of AA with a stable outlook and Aa3 with a positive outlook (per January 13, 2023). In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Group's estimated SST ratio 1 remained very strong at 265 percent.\n\nDuring the year the Group saw net cash remittances of USD 4.6 billion, resulting in a cumulative USD 12.4 billion for the period 2020-2022, exceeding the USD 11.5 billion target over this period. The level of remittances has been driven by both operational earnings and capital released as a result of the Group's efforts to extract capital from its operating businesses.\n\n## Net cash remittances by business\n\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 (in USD millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Estimated Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio, calculated based on the Group's internal model approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.

The transaction includes the transfer of approximately USD 20 billion of net reserves, mainly related to annuity and endowment products underwritten more than five years ago. The sale will further reduce capital intensity and exposure to interest rates and reduces capital required to protect against volatility. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and will not change the contractual obligations to customers and distribution partners. The sale is expected to close in Q4 2023.\n\n## Sale of Italian life and pensions back book to GamaLife\n\nOn January 2, 2022 the Group announced that its subsidiary Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. agreed to sell part of its life and pension back book, composed of both traditional and unit-linked policies, to the Portuguese insurance company GamaLife - Companhia de Seguros de Vida, S.A. The transaction transferred USD 9.5 billion of net reserves transferred to GamaLife. The transaction will positively impact the Group's Swiss Solvency Test ratio and increase the Group's liquidity by approximately USD 200 million. The transaction closed on November 30, 2022.\n\n## Acquisition of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors network\n\nOn October 14, 2022, the Group through its subsidiary Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A. completed the acquisition of the network of Financial Advisors of the Deutsche Bank Group in Italy. The terms of the agreement provide for the transfer of a business unit consisting of approximately 1,085 financial advisors, 97 employees and EUR 16.5 billion of assets under management.

At the same time, Zurich delivered on its responsible investment goals for the year and set further ambitions.\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nIn 2022, we saw the legacy and imbalances from the COVID-19 pandemic shape the economic and financial market landscape. Three themes stood out over the course of 2022: persistently higher inflation, unprecedented central bank tightening and, of course, the tragic invasion of Ukraine. Unusually, the three key financial asset classes of equities, credit and government bonds all closed the year substantially lower.\n\nStrong household balance sheets in many developed economies, as a result of the dramatic government support measures during the pandemic, combined with very strong employment conditions, fueled demand and inflation. The energy shock from the war further accelerated the rise in prices, with European natural gas surging from EUR 60 per kilowatt hour to EUR 340 by late summer, as talk of rationing and blackouts in Europe gained traction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

U.S. mortgage rates doubled and housing activity in many developed economies slowed markedly. Global growth moderated over the course of the year, falling below its long-term average. This was exacerbated by China's zero-COVID-19 policy before a surprising about-face in the closing weeks of 2022.\n\n## A high-quality portfolio\n\nDuring 2022, the composition of our investment portfolio continued to demonstrate stability and benefit from a conservative exposure to credit risk. Zurich's portfolio retained its highquality profile with 95 percent in fixed income securities rated BBB and above. Our investment portfolio also continues to be well diversified across regions and industries.\n\n## Stable net investment income\n\nIn a difficult market environment, our 2022 net investment income remained stable at USD 5.1 billion compared with the prior year. Equity and fixed-income markets mostly showed negative returns during 2022. Realized capital gains and losses (including impairments) for the year resulted in a loss of USD 951 million, mainly from fixed-income and equity securities. This was partially offset by derivative and real estate revaluation gains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Credit, private debt                  | 44.4%   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Government and  government guaranteed | 31.7%   |\n| Real estate                           | 9.6%    |\n| Cash                                  | 5.8%    |\n| Equities                              | 3.8%    |\n| Mortgages                             | 2.7%    |\n| Hedge funds, private equity           | 2.1%    |\n\n- 1 Market value of the investment portfolio (economic view).\n\nThe net investment result for 2022 was USD 4.1 billion. While the total returns for assets and liabilities were negative in 2022, Zurich's assets have outperformed its liabilities. The associated market risk consumption declined during 2022.\n\n## Financing climate solutions\n\nDespite a challenging market environment, Zurich delivered on its responsible investment ambition during 2022 and set further one. We plan to invest 5 percent of our proprietary investment portfolio to impact investments by 2025. We aim to achieve this target by growing our existing global impact investment portfolio and identifying new prospective opportunities across asset classes to broaden our approach.\n\nIn 2022, we increased our investments in climate solutions by 6 percent to USD 8.7 billion. These investments provide green financing solutions under our impact investing strategy and also count as investments in green certified buildings. Our green impact investing assets, for example solar and wind farms, have helped avoid 3.2 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions in 2022. We are proud that our impact investment approach won three awards in 2022, recognizing our leadership as an institutional investor in this area.\n\nWe strongly believe that simply divesting from companies with carbon-intense footprints is less effective than engaging\n\n## Rating of credit, private debt securities, 2022\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| AAA                  | 19.1%   |\n|----------------------|---------|\n| AA                   | 12.9%   |\n| A                    | 27. 2 % |\n| BBB                  | 33.8%   |\n| Non-investment grade | 7. 0 %  |\n| Unrated              | 0.0%    |\n\n| Non-financial credit                | 31.3%   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Financial credit                    | 23.8%   |\n| Municipals, agencies,  state credit | 16.2%   |\n| Other                               | 14.5%   |\n| Asset backed securities             | 9.2%    |\n| Covered bonds                       | 5.0%    |\n\nwith them to drive the shift to sustainable practices. On that journey with our investee companies, we have already engaged with 54 percent of emitters of financed emissions that have not set science-based targets, and we require these companies to set targets aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nSince 2019, we have achieved a reduction in the emission intensity of our portfolio of 12 percent. This reduction in financed emissions was mainly driven by disposals and changes to our portfolio as well as structural emission reductions of our investee companies. We have observed a meaningful drop in emissions from companies in run-off under our coal and oil sands policy due to maturing assets and active portfolio management.\n\nSince the launch of the Zurich Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund, we have seen positive feedback from our customers and distributors. As a result, the fund is now available in eight different countries: Chile, Germany, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Malaysia. Despite the challenging environment for financial markets, net flows into the fund were positive during 2022, benefiting from continued customer interest.\n\nStephan van Vliet Group Chief Investment Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Credit and private debt securities per segment, 2022\n\n%",

The Group operates in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific through subsidiaries, as well as branch and representative offices.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd, a Swiss corporation, is the holding company of the Group and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Zurich Insurance Group Ltd was incorporated on April 26, 2000, in Zurich, Switzerland. It is recorded in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Zurich under its registered address at Mythenquai 2, 8002 Zurich.\n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd authorized these consolidated financial statements for issue. These financial statements will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 6, 2023.\n\n## 1. Basis of presentation\n\n## General information\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. Where IFRS does not contain clear guidance governing the accounting treatment of certain transactions, including those that are specific to insurance and reinsurance products, IFRS permits reference to another comprehensive body of accounting principles that uses a similar conceptual framework. The Group's accounting policies for insurance and reinsurance contracts are therefore based on those developed by the Group before the adoption of IFRS 4 in areas where IFRS 4 did not include specific requirements. Before the adoption of IFRS 4 on January 1, 2005, the Group typically applied U.S. GAAP pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on insurance and reinsurance contracts. Any changes to such pronouncements subsequent to this adoption are not reflected in the Group's accounting policies. In case of business combinations, the Group may decide to maintain the local statutory treatment if this does not distort the fair presentation of the financial position of the Group. If significant, the impact of such cases would be described elsewhere in the notes to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies applied by the reportable segments are the same as those applied by the Group. The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices. Dividends, realized capital gains and losses as well as gains and losses on the transfer of net assets are eliminated within the segment, whereas all other intercompany gains and losses are eliminated at Group level. In the consolidated financial statements, inter-segment revenues and transfers are eliminated.\n\nCertain amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management about insurance liability reserves, investment valuations, interest rates and other factors.\n\nThe Group continues to closely monitor and deal with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, though most of the impacts on the Group's business are known and reflected in management's best estimates.\n\nDuring 2022, most economies saw a continued rise in inflation further intensified by the war in Ukraine. Central banks have responded by tightening monetary policy, triggering a significant sell-off in equity and bond markets. Investment valuation and interest rates incorporate these market conditions as of December 31, 2022, and recoverability of intangible assets has been tested where the value of these intangible assets, including goodwill, is sensitive to prevailing market conditions. For more information on investments and fair value, please see note 6 and 23, respectively. For more information on intangible assets, please see note 14. The Group's exposure to Russia and Ukraine through its property & casualty operations and its investments portfolio is immaterial.\n\nIn 2022, following the announcement of the sale of its legacy traditional life insurance back book in Germany, the Group reclassified the related assets and liabilities as held for sale. Under IFRS 5, insurance assets and liabilities are not required to be remeasured upon reclassification. Upon reclassification, the Group considered the fact that the transaction is expected to close in 2023, after the Group will have adopted IFRS 17 retrospectively.\n\nThe Group considers various factors to determine whether an economy in a country where a foreign operation is situated is hyperinflationary. Any material translation adjustments resulting from initial application of the hyperinflationary accounting is recognized directly in equity.",

For long-duration life insurance contracts, IFRS 17 requires a significant change to actuarial modeling as granular cash flow projections, and regular updates of all assumptions will be required resulting in either profit or loss volatility or affecting 'contractual service margin (CSM)'. CSM is presented as a separate component of the insurance liability representing unearned profits from in-force contracts. IFRS 17 further introduces a risk adjustment for non-financial risk, a separate component of the insurance liability covering uncertainty in the amount and timing of future cash flows. Thus, the insurance liabilities will be composed of the current best estimate present value of future cash flows (PVFCF), risk adjustment and CSM.\n\nIFRS 17 introduces different measurement models in calculating (re-)insurance contract liabilities reflecting the different extents of policyholder participation in investment or insurance entity performance: non-participating or indirect participating (general model or the building block approach (BBA)) and direct participating (variable fee approach (VFA)). For short-duration contracts, IFRS 17 permits a simplified approach (premium allocation approach (PAA)), which can be applied to contracts that have a coverage period of 12 months or less or for which such simplification would produce a measurement of the liability for remaining coverage that would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the BBA. The simplification allows the liability for remaining coverage to be measured primarily based on premium received, less earned premium and unamortized acquisition cash flows, rather than to be disaggregated into PVFCF, risk adjustment and CSM. The liability for incurred claims is measured consistently with the BBA, whereby all the incurred claims are subject to discounting and risk adjustment.\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, the insurance revenue and insurance service expenses will be presented gross of reinsurance, with the reinsurance result included in the net expenses from reinsurance contracts held. The (re-)insurance contract liabilities are subject to discounting; the unwind of the discount will be part of the (re-) insurance finance income or expenses, rather than insurance service result. For the majority of its in-force (re-)insurance contracts, except for unit-linked insurance contracts, the Group will apply the option in IFRS 17 to disaggregate the (re-)insurance finance income or expense between profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI). Under this option, the unwind of discount in profit or loss is based on locked-in discount rates and the difference in valuation due to changes in discount rates is presented in OCI.\n\nThe Group will apply bottom-up discount rates for most groups of (re-)insurance contracts. Bottom-up discount rates are constructed using risk-free rates, plus an illiquidity premium, where applicable. Risk-free rates are determined by reference to the market interest rates (either swap rates or yields of highly liquid sovereign securities) in the currency of the respective (re-)insurance contract liabilities. Whenever the duration of the liabilities exceeds the liquid part of the yield curve in the respective currency (the last liquid point), the risk-free interest rate is extrapolated to converge towards a long-term rate (the ultimate forward rate) using widely accepted extrapolation techniques (Smith-Wilson algorithm). The illiquidity premium is determined by reference to observable market spreads for illiquid instruments (e.g., corporate debt, etc.) adequately corrected to remove credit risk.\n\nThe Group will estimate the risk adjustment using a confidence level approach taking into account the Group's internal view of the level of capital required in order to continue operating on a going concern basis based on the Group's target Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio. The risk adjustment is calibrated as the value at risk (VaR) at the defined target confidence level minus the expected value of the future cash flows using the simulations of the distribution of the future cash flows. This distribution is based on the SST framework and model, with a few modifications considering the different purpose of the IFRS 17 risk adjustment. Separate target confidence levels will apply to the distribution of cash flows of long-duration (predominantly life) and short-duration (predominantly non-life) (re-)insurance contracts. We expect the confidence levels to fall within the following ranges: 74 - 79% for short-duration and 90 - 95% for longduration (re-)insurance contracts. The Group will disaggregate the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk between the insurance service result and (re-)insurance finance income or expenses, and the latter between profit or loss and OCI, so that the movement in risk adjustment resulting from changes in discount rates is presented in OCI.\n\nThe Group will allocate the CSM at the end of the reporting period based on the underlying coverage units. The coverage units represent the quantity of (re-)insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided under a contract and its expected coverage period. The sum assured (or annuity) in force is considered as the main driver for determining coverage units for insurance service under BBA. Whenever the Group provides both insurance service and investment-related or investment-return service to the policyholders, the coverage units are appropriately weighted to reflect both services to allocate the CSM over the current and remaining coverage period, whereby the assets under management (or equivalent) are considered as the main driver for determining coverage units for investment-related or investment-return service. The CSM allocated to coverage units provided in the period will be recognized in profit or loss.\n\nAs IFRS 17 is applied retrospectively, the Group determined the transition approach at a group of insurance contracts level, depending on availability of reasonable and supportable historic information. The selected transition approach affected the measurement of the CSM on initial adoption of IFRS 17:\n\n- - Fully retrospective approach - the CSM is based on initial assumptions when groups of contracts were incepted and rolled forward to the date of transition as if IFRS 17 had always been applied;\n- - Modified retrospective approach - the CSM is calculated using modifications allowed by IFRS 17 taking into account the actual pre-transition fulfilment cash flows; and\n- - Fair value approach - the CSM at transition is calculated as the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts, without the consideration of the demand deposit floor requirement, and the respective fulfilment cash flows measured at the transition date.\n\nWhen a fully retrospective approach was considered impracticable due to lack of historical data or application of hindsight, the Group chose between a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach. The Group applied a retrospective transition approach whenever practical, with more than 80 percent of CSM of groups of (re-)insurance contracts following either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach.\n\nIn applying the modified retrospective and fair value approach for certain groups of non-life and life (re-)insurance contracts prior to the transition date, the Group used the modifications allowed under IFRS 17, such as grouping contracts issued more than 1 year apart into a single group for measurement purposes or applying interest rates as at transition date and setting the cumulative amount of (re-)insurance finance income or expenses recognized in other comprehensive income to nil.",

Under IFRS 9, all equity securities and fund investments, and some debt instruments will be measured at fair value through profit or loss when the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from such instruments are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Though IFRS 9 introduces an option to account for some equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) with no recycling of gains or losses through profit or loss, the Group does not intend to make material use of this option. The debt instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in OCI, if held under the standard business model to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, or at amortized cost, if part of selected portfolios that are held to collect contractual cash flows. Furthermore, IFRS 9 introduces a requirement to recognize expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost or at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in OCI.\n\nThough overall profit or loss volatility is expected to increase under IFRS 9, the measurement approach for direct participating contracts in IFRS 17 allows such volatility to be largely absorbed in the measurement of insurance liabilities with an option to reflect the effect of any asset-liability mismatch in shareholders' equity (OCI). Therefore, the Group decided to defer the full implementation of IFRS 9 until IFRS 17 becomes effective to better align the measurement approaches for the financial assets held and the (re-)insurance contract liabilities where appropriate. Based on the analysis performed as of December 31, 2015, the Group was eligible to apply the temporary exemption from the adoption of IFRS 9 for reporting entities that have not previously applied any version of IFRS 9 and whose activities are predominantly related to insurance, as the predominance ratio reflecting the share of liabilities connected with insurance to total liabilities exceeded 90 percent. No reassessment of eligibility was required during subsequent annual periods up to and including 2022 as there was no significant change in the activities performed by the Group. We refer to the Annual Report 2016 for further details on the eligibility assessment. The Group presents additional disclosures of indicative effects from adoption of IFRS 9 required by IFRS 4 'Applying IFRS 9 with IFRS 4' during the period of deferral in note 24.\n\n## Preliminary effects of the transition to IFRS 17 on January 1, 2022\n\nIn order to adopt IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 in the consolidated financial statements, a joint IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Group Implementation Program sponsored by the Group Chief Financial Officer has been operating since 2017. The Program made significant progress in 2022 to ensure operational readiness and financial analysis for the opening balance sheet reporting as of the transition date of January 1, 2022, which is the starting point for the comparative period information required by IFRS 17.\n\nThe Group adopts IFRS 17 retrospectively, and restates the comparative period of 2022; however, no restatement will be performed for the effects of the initial application of IFRS 9. IFRS 17 allows a transition option that permits an entity to apply a classification overlay for IFRS 9 in the comparative period presented on initial application of IFRS 17. The Group applies this IFRS 9 classification overlay for selected asset portfolios backing direct participating insurance contracts which are accounted for at amortized cost under the current accounting framework but are expected to be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) under IFRS 9. Furthermore, derivatives that have been previously designated as hedging instruments in effective cash flow hedge relationships, which hedge reinvestment risk from underlying assets backing direct participating contracts, are no longer presented as hedging derivatives. These derivatives are part of underlying items held for direct participating contracts. With the adoption of IFRS 17, these derivatives are presented as trading derivatives with the unrealized gains/losses included in the measurement of direct participating contracts under IFRS 17. Expected credit loss requirements have not been adopted as part of the overlay approach.\n\nAt the transition date, the Group classified, recognized and measured its in-force business as if IFRS 17 had always been applied. The Group recognized and measured assets for insurance acquisition cash flows as if IFRS 17 had always been applied, except that the recoverability assessment was not applied before the transition date. The Group also derecognized previously reported balances (e.g., deferred acquisition costs, present value of future profits, deferred front-end fees) that would not have existed if IFRS 17 had always been applied and recognized any resulting net difference in equity.\n\nFurthermore, the Group reclassified all rights and obligations arising from portfolios of (re-)insurance contracts, such as (1) (re-)insurance contract liabilities and liabilities for investment contracts with discretionary participation features, (2) policyholder loans that are highly interrelated with the insurance contracts, (3) (re-)insurance-related receivables or payables and (4) insurance acquisition cash flows, to be presented as (re-)insurance contract assets/liabilities. Portfolios of insurance contracts issued are presented separately from portfolios of reinsurance contracts held.",

Due to their short-term nature, such in-force contracts typically applied the fully retrospective transition approach. However, for contracts that have expired prior to the transition date, for which no eligibility assessment for the application of PAA has been performed, the Group applied BBA with certain permissible transition modifications. The use of these modifications resulted in the measurement of the liability for incurred claims under modified retrospective or fair value approach using discount rates as at transition date. As the Group already applies best estimate reserving under its current accounting policies, the implementation of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a major impact on non-life nominal reserves. The effect of onerous groups of contracts is not material for the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group further assessed that a significant portion of its life insurance liabilities (including unit-linked insurance liabilities and certain life insurance contracts involving policyholder participation in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and Austria) qualify as direct participating contracts under IFRS 17 and are eligible for the application of the VFA measurement model. The optional exemption from the annual cohort requirement for such contracts is not applicable to the Group. For the direct participating contracts, excluding unit-linked insurance contracts, the Group applied the modified retrospective approach. Under IFRS 17, the measurement of such contracts uses the fair value of the underlying items and fulfilment cash flows at transition date, adjusted for actual amounts charged and paid in the past, to derive the transition CSM balance. Another large proportion of the life insurance liabilities including term life, whole-of-life and universal life contracts follows the BBA. The Group applied the modified retrospective or the fair value approach to the extent it was impracticable to apply the fully retrospective approach using the modifications allowed under IFRS 17. The Group also issues short-term life insurance contracts that are eligible for the application of PAA for which fully retrospective approach is applied.\n\nTable 2.3 provides an overview of the Group's consolidated balance sheet line items (as presented in the 2021 Annual Report) that are affected by the transition to IFRS 17 and the expected consolidated balance sheet line items upon adoption of IFRS 17. It further reflects the effect of IFRS 9 overlay on the Group's consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2022.",

The net transition impact to shareholder's equity consisted of the following offsetting effects:\n\n- - Recognition of future profits for contracts accounted for under the BBA and VFA (CSM) as an explicit liability (negative effect);\n- - Recognition of the shareholders' share of unrealized capital gains from underlying investments within liabilities for direct participating contracts under the VFA (negative effect);\n- - Recognition of a separate risk adjustment for non-financial risk (negative effect);\n- - Derecognition of deferred acquisition costs and front-end fees under IFRS 4 (negative effect);\n- - Application of discounting to non-life reserves that were not previously discounted (positive effect);\n- - Application of best estimate rather than locked-in assumptions for life insurance liabilities (positive effect).\n\nDue to the current market movements and the increase in interest rates during 2022, we observed a significant reduction in unrealized gains from debt securities (see note 6), which contributed to the reduction in IFRS 4 shareholders' equity. The effect on IFRS 17 shareholder's equity is much less pronounced due to offsetting effects between asset and liability valuations. Therefore, the estimated difference between the IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 shareholder's equity reduced by USD 6.0 billion from USD 8.8 billion as of the transition date to USD 1.8 billion at June 30, 2022.\n\n## Transition effect of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 overlay for balance sheet items impacted\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group does not expect significant changes in the business operating profit as a result from the transition to IFRS 17.\n\n## Preliminary effects of the transition to IFRS 9 on January 1, 2023\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 on January 1, 2023 is expected to impact shareholders' equity mainly due to the following effects that will be recognized in opening retained earnings on transition to IFRS 9:\n\n- - Unrealized gains/losses from equity securities that were previously recognized in OCI;\n- - Unrealized gains/losses from debt securities that do not pass the solely payments of principle and interest test and will be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9;\n- - Unrealized gains/losses from debt instruments that were previously accounted for at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option but will be held under the business models 'held to collect contractual cash flows' or 'held to collect contractual cash flows and for sale' under IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group does not expect significant changes to the business operating profit as a result of the application of IFRS 9.\n\nAt the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements, the Group continues the preparation of the comparative period financial information based on IFRS 17 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which will be followed by transition to IFRS 9. At this date, it was not practicable to reliably quantify the effects of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform (including Phase 2 amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)\n\nThe ongoing market-wide reform targets replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative reference rates (ARRs). To ensure an orderly transition to ARRs, the Group launched a cross-functional IBOR transition working group that has analyzed the exposure and defined mitigating actions, for example, by adhering to the ISDA fallback protocols for derivatives, amending terms and conditions of new debt issuances and entering into bilateral negotiations with counterparties.\n\nDuring 2022, JPY, CHF, GBP LIBOR and EONIA (Euro Overnight Index Average) settings were officially decommissioned with no major impact for the Group as most of the exposures indexed on those reference rates were already transitioned to new ARRs. During the second half of the year, given the developments in market liquidity, the Group decided to transition to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR exposures. For EUR exposure, EURIBOR is still the dominant reference rate, but the Group continues to monitor market readiness and liquidity metrics for potential transition to \u20acSTR (Euro short-term rate) in 2023. The reform has not resulted in changes to the Group risk management strategy.\n\nThe IASB addressed the financial reporting implications of the IBOR reform through IFRS amendments, which were fully adopted by the Group on January 1, 2020. Specifically, the phase 2 amendments introduce a practical expedient to account prospectively for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument attributable to the replacement of IBORs with ARR and relieve from specific hedge accounting requirements. Overall, the IBOR reform has no material effect on the Group's financial statements and the effectiveness of the Group's hedging relationships.\n\nOther standards, amendments and interpretations shown in table 2.2 are expected to have no, or an insignificant, impact on the Group's financial position or performance.",

Summary of significant accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. Other accounting policies are presented as part of the respective note disclosures.\n\n## a) Consolidation principles\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that Zurich Insurance Group Ltd either directly or indirectly controls. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries that have been divested during the year are included up to the date control ceased. All intra-Group balances, profits and transactions are eliminated.\n\nChanges in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a change in control are recorded within equity.\n\nNon-controlling interests are shown separately in equity, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity, as well as related disclosures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared as of December 31 based on individual company financial statements at the same date. In some cases, information is included with a time lag of up to three months. The resulting effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.\n\n## b) Foreign currency translation and transactions\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nDue to the Group's economic exposure to the U.S. dollar (USD), the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements is USD. Many Group companies have a different functional currency, being that of the respective primary economic environment in which these companies operate. Assets and liabilities are translated into the presentation currency at end-of-period exchange rates, while income statements and statements of cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded directly in other comprehensive income (OCI) as cumulative translation adjustment (CTA).\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, for practical reasons, a weighted average rate, if exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly. Foreign currency monetary items and foreign currency non-monetary items that are carried at fair value are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded in income, except for the following:\n\n- - Foreign currency translation differences that are recognized in OCI in conjunction with the recognition of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments; and\n- - Foreign currency translation differences arising on monetary items that form part of net investments in foreign operations, as well as foreign currency translation differences arising from monetary items that are designated as hedging instruments in a qualifying net investment hedge relationship, are included directly in OCI as CTA.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nThe Group considers various factors to determine whether an economy in a country where a foreign operation is situated is hyperinflationary, including the cumulative three-year inflation rate. If an economy becomes hyperinflationary, the financial statements of foreign operations with the functional currency of the hyperinflationary economy are restated to reflect the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period using the official consumer price indices commonly used in the respective country. The restatement includes all balance sheet amounts that are not expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date and items of comprehensive income for the current year by applying the change in the price index from the dates when the items of income and expense were originally recorded. The restated financial statements of a foreign operation are translated into the Group's presentation currency at closing rates. Any translation adjustment resulting from initial application of the hyperinflationary accounting is recognized directly in equity.\n\n## c) Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features (DPF)\n\n## Classification\n\nContracts issued that transfer significant insurance risk to the Group and obligations arising from investment contracts with DPF are accounted for as insurance contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\nThe Group also issues products containing embedded options that entitle the policyholder to switch all or part of the current and future invested funds into another product issued by the Group. Where this results in the reclassification of an investment product to a product that meets the definition of an insurance contract, the previously held reserve and the related deferred origination costs are reclassified and are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy that is to be applied to the new product on a prospective basis. As a consequence, no gain or loss is recognized when a contract is reclassified from an investment to an insurance contract.\n\nOnce a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, no reclassification can subsequently be made.\n\n## Premiums\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nPremiums from the sale of property & casualty products are generally recorded when written and are recognized as revenue in relation to the insurance coverage provided. The unearned premium reserve represents the portion of the premiums written related to the unexpired coverage period.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nPremiums from traditional life insurance contracts, including participating contracts and annuity policies with life contingencies, are recognized as revenue when they are due from the policyholder. For single premium and limited pay contracts, premiums are recognized as revenue when due, with any excess profit deferred and recognized in income in a constant relationship to the insurance in-force or, for annuities, the amount of expected benefit payments.\n\nAmounts collected as premiums from investment-type insurance contracts such as universal life, unit-linked and unitized with-profits contracts are generally reported as deposits. Revenue from these contracts consists of policy fees for the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the period. Front-end fees charged to the customer at inception, particularly for single premium contracts, are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the contracts following the same pattern that is applied to deferred acquisition costs and addressed below. Regular fees charged to the customer periodically (monthly, quarterly or annually) either directly or by making a deduction from invested funds are billed in advance and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the service is rendered. Fees charged at the end of the period are accrued over the service period as a receivable and are offset against the financial liability when charged to the customer.\n\nCash flows from certain universal life-type contracts in the Group's Spanish operations are recognized as gross written premiums and insurance benefits and losses and not as deposits.\n\n## Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income as incurred. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred. Any changes in estimates are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which estimates are changed. The Group does not discount its loss reserves, other than for claims with payment patterns which are fixed and reasonably determinable, and claims in economies determined to be hyperinflationary where inflation constitutes a significant input in the reserving process.\n\n## Reserves for life benefits\n\nFuture life policyholder benefits represent the estimated future benefit liability for traditional life insurance policies and include the value of accumulated declared bonuses or dividends that have vested to policyholders.\n\nThe reserves for life benefits for participating traditional life insurance policies are calculated using a net level premium valuation method based on actuarial assumptions taking into account guaranteed mortality benefits and interest rates.\n\nThe reserves for life benefits for other traditional life insurance policies are calculated using a net level premium valuation method based on actuarial assumptions including mortality, persistency, expenses and investment return, plus a margin for adverse deviations. These assumptions are locked in at inception and are regularly assessed as part of the liability adequacy testing over the period of the contract.\n\nPolicyholder contract deposits represent the estimated policy benefits for investment-type insurance contracts invested in non-unit-linked funds. This liability comprises the accumulation of premiums received, less charges, plus declared policyholder dividends.\n\nSome insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF offered by the Group contain benefit features for which the amount and timing of declaration and payment are at the discretion of the Group. Where that discretion has not been exercised, the total amount expected to be allocated to policyholders as required by local insurance regulation or contractual provisions is included in the policyholder other funds.",

Where these assets are related to life insurance, corresponding adjustments to the reserves for life benefits and related assets are also recognized directly in OCI.\n\nReserves for unit-linked contracts are based on the fair value of the financial instruments backing those contracts less any fees and assessments charged to the policyholders. The related assets for unit-linked insurance contracts are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce measurement inconsistencies.\n\nFor products containing guarantees in respect of minimum death benefits (GMDB), retirement income benefits (GRIB) and/ or annuitization options (GAO), additional liabilities are recorded in proportion to the receipt of the contracted revenues which are subject to a liability adequacy test taking into account policyholder behavior and current market conditions.\n\nFor products managed on a dynamic basis using derivative hedging strategies, an option in IFRS 4 is used to measure insurance liabilities using current financial and non-financial assumptions to better reflect the way that these products are managed. Financial assets related to these liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)\n\nCosts that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal business, including for example commissions and certain underwriting and policy issue expenses, are deferred and subsequently amortized over a defined period. Such costs are presented on balance sheet net of commissions paid to reinsurers in respect of business ceded.\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nDAC for property & casualty contracts is amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nDAC for traditional participating life insurance contracts is amortized based on estimated gross margins expected to be realized over the life of the contract. Estimated gross margins are updated for actual and anticipated future experience and discounted using the latest revised interest rate for the remaining benefit period. Resulting deviations are reflected in income.\n\nDAC for other traditional life insurance and annuity contracts is amortized over the life of the contracts, based on expected premiums. Expected premiums are estimated at the date of policy issue for application throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency subsequently occurs.\n\nDAC for investment-type insurance contracts such as universal life, unit-linked and unitized with-profits contracts is amortized based on estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the contract. Estimated gross profits are updated for actual and anticipated future experience and discounted using either the interest rate in effect at the inception of the contracts or the latest revised interest rate for the remaining benefit period, depending on whether crediting is based on the policyholder's or on the reporting entity's investment performance. Resulting deviations are reflected in income.\n\nUnamortized DAC for life insurance contracts accrues interest at a rate consistent with the related assumptions for reserves.\n\nFor traditional participating and investment-type life insurance contracts, DAC is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains/(losses) on allocated investments that are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Liability adequacy tests\n\nLiability adequacy tests are performed annually for groupings of contracts determined in accordance with the Group's manner of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of its insurance contracts.\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nFor property & casualty contracts, unearned premiums are tested to determine whether they are sufficient to cover related expected losses, loss adjustment expenses, policyholder dividends, unamortized DAC and maintenance expenses, using current assumptions and considering anticipated investment returns. If a premium deficiency is identified, the DAC asset for the respective grouping of contracts is written down by the amount of the deficiency. If, after writing down the DAC asset to nil, a premium deficiency still exists for the respective grouping of contracts, then an additional reserve is established for the amount of the remaining deficiency.",

If a deficiency is identified, the DAC or PVFP for the respective grouping of contracts is written down by the amount of the deficiency. If, after writing down the DAC or PVFP to nil, a deficiency still exists for the respective grouping of contracts, the reserve for life benefits is increased by the amount of the remaining deficiency.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nThe Group's insurance subsidiaries cede risk in the normal course of business to limit the potential for losses arising from certain exposures. Reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of its liability. Certain Group insurance companies assume reinsurance business as part of their normal business.\n\nReinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for using the deposit method.\n\nA deposit asset or liability is recognized based on the premium paid or received, less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained by the ceding company. Interest on deposits is accounted for using the effective interest rate method. Future cash flows are estimated to calculate the effective yield, and revenues and expenses are recorded as interest income or expense. Reinsurance deposit assets or liabilities also include funds deposited or held by the Group under assumed or ceded reinsurance contracts, respectively, when funds are retained by the reinsured under the terms of the contract.\n\nReinsurance is recorded gross in the consolidated balance sheet. Reinsurance assets include balances expected to be recovered from reinsurance companies for ceded paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the liabilities associated with the underlying insurance contracts.\n\nReinsurance assets are assessed for impairment on a regular basis and impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the same manner as for loans and receivables.\n\n## d) Liabilities for investment contracts (without DPF)\n\nInvestment contracts are those contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk. The Group issues investment contracts without fixed terms (unit-linked) and investment contracts with fixed and guaranteed terms (fixed interest rate).\n\n## Unit-linked investment contracts\n\nThese represent portfolios maintained to meet the specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the credit, market and liquidity risks related to the investments. The liabilities are carried at fair value, which is determined by reference to the underlying financial assets. Changes in fair value are recorded in income. The related assets for unit-linked investment contracts are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce measurement inconsistencies.\n\nThe services provided by the Group under such contracts are investment management and policy administration services that are provided over time and are not contingent on meeting specified performance criteria. Fees from such services are recognized ratably over the service period as policy fee revenue except where such fees are charged in connection with contract origination in which case such fees are recognized as contract liabilities (included within deferred front-end fees). The costs to fulfill the services over time are generally recognized as incurred, except the costs of acquiring new investment contracts with investment management services, such as commissions and other incremental expenses directly related to the issuance of each new contract. Such fees enhance the resources that will be used to satisfy future performance obligations and - to the extent recoverable - are capitalized as contract assets (deferred origination costs, DOC) and amortized in line with the revenue generated by providing investment management services. See note 11 for further information.\n\n## Investment contracts at amortized cost\n\nLiabilities for investment contracts with fixed and guaranteed terms are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs are included in the calculation of the effective yield. As of each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the expected future cash flows and re-calculates the carrying amount of the financial liability by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the original effective interest rate for the financial liability. Any adjustment is immediately recognized in income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group continues to apply the requirements in IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' until implementation of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' on January 1, 2023 (see note 2).\n\nThe majority of Group investments are accounted for at fair value through OCI (available-for-sale financial assets) and include debt and equity securities as well as fund investments. Such assets are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in OCI, until the securities are either sold or impaired. Interest income determined using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through OCI is included in net investment income. The cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI are net of cumulative deferred income taxes, certain related life policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to income as net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments.\n\nGroup investments at fair value through profit or loss include debt and equity securities backing certain life insurance contracts with participation features, and financial assets evaluated on a fair value basis. The designation of these assets at fair value through profit or loss eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or recognizing the gains and losses on these assets on a different basis to the liabilities.\n\nGroup investments at amortized cost include debt securities for which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity (held-to-maturity financial assets) as well as mortgage and other loans (loans and receivables). Such investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any charges for impairment. When an impairment is determined to have occurred, the carrying amount of held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the movement in the impairment allowance is recognized in income as an impairment loss.\n\nThe Group recognizes regular purchases and sales of financial assets on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognized in income, within net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments, in the period in which they arise. Interest income determined using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is included in net investment income.\n\nGroup investments include investment property accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Rental income from investment property is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in net investment income along with rental operating expenses for investment property recognized on an accrual basis.\n\nGroup investments include the following in cash and cash equivalents: cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, cash collateral received and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at current redemption value.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that loss events have occurred that negatively affect the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset or a group of financial assets. The evaluation of whether a financial asset is impaired requires significant judgment (see note 4).\n\n## f) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments, except those designated under a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge relationship, are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in income. Centrally cleared and over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to daily cash variation margin payments are typically presented net of cash collateral, with any excess of cash paid or received included as a receivable or a payable on the balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Integrated sustainability disclosure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by the Group to economically hedge risks. In limited circumstances derivative financial instruments are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes in:\n\n- - Fair value hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- - Cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss.\n- - Net investment hedges, which are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nAll hedge relationships are formally documented, including the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge. At inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge relationship is formally assessed to determine whether the hedging instruments are expected to be (prospective assessment) and have been (retrospective assessment) highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk. If the qualifying criteria for the application of hedge accounting are no longer met, the hedge relationship is discontinued prospectively, in which case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are then subsequently reported independently in accordance with the respective accounting policy.\n\nThe accounting treatment of a qualifying hedge relationship is further described in note 7.\n\n## g) Attorney-in-fact (AIF) contracts\n\nThe AIF contracts reflect the ability of the Group to generate future revenues through Farmers Group Inc. (FGI) based on the FGI's relationship with the Farmers Exchanges. The Farmers Exchanges are not owned by FGI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. In determining that these relationships have an indefinite useful life, the Group took into consideration the organizational structure of inter-insurance exchanges, under which subscribers exchange contracts with each other and appoint an attorney-in-fact to provide non-claims services, and the historical AIF relationship between FGI and the Farmers Exchanges. The value of the AIF contracts is tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe services provided by FGI under such contracts are non-claims services including risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative functions. The multiple performance obligations covered by the consideration received are considered to be a series with the same pattern of transfer; therefore, the performance obligations are not separated. The revenue for the services provided includes Farmers management fee, membership fees and revenues for ancillary services. Farmers management fees are determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges and recognized ratably over the period the services are provided. Membership fees are one-time fees charged at the time of the policy issuance that do not cover a distinct performance obligation. Such fees are recognized as revenue over the expected life of the customer relationship. The incremental costs incurred in connection with the customer setup activity are recognized as an asset and subsequently amortized using the same pattern as the related revenue. The revenue for ancillary services includes remuneration for services provided that are not covered by Farmers management fees where FGI acts as a principal. Typically, these services are provided over time, so that the revenue is also recognized over time. See note 26 for further information.\n\n## h) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) based on the level at which management monitors operations and makes decisions related to the continuation or disposal of assets and operations. If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the carrying amount of the operation includes attributable goodwill when determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## i) Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets typically have finite lives and are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairments. Such assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## Present value of future profits from acquired insurance contracts (PVFP)\n\nAn intangible asset representing the PVFP arises from the acquisition of life insurance businesses. Such an asset is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts, following the same principles as for DAC. The carrying value of the PVFP asset is tested periodically for impairment as part of the liability adequacy test for insurance contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized. Software under development is tested for impairment annually.\n\nAcquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software into use.\n\nThe useful lives of computer software licenses and capitalized internal software development costs generally range from three to five years. In limited circumstances, capitalized software development costs may be amortized over a period of up to 10 years, taking into account the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic and legal factors.\n\n## j) Employee benefits\n\n## Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group operates long-term incentive plans that are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of these incentive plans is determined at the grant date and is recognized as an expense in income over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase recorded in additional paid-in capital.\n\nSubsequently, depending on the underlying performance metrics, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be issued and recognizes the impact of the revision, if any, in income with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. However, no subsequent adjustment is made after the vesting date. See note 21 for further information.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe Group operates various post-employment benefit plans for its employees worldwide, which include defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, and other post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as an expense in the period in which the economic benefit from the employees' service was received.\n\nDefined benefit plan obligations and current service costs are determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets with changes from remeasurements recorded in OCI. If the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nGroup's expense related to these plans is accrued over the employees' service periods based on the actuarially determined cost for the period. Net interest and service costs are determined using the spot rate approach. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized, in full in the period in which they occur, in OCI. Past service costs, which result from plan amendments and curtailments, are recognized in income when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs (which is the date from which the plan change is irrevocable) and the date on which a constructive obligation arises. Settlement gains or losses are recognized in income when the settlement occurs. See note 20 for further information.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nOther post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance, are also provided for certain employees and are primarily funded internally. Similar to defined benefit plans, the cost of such benefits is accrued over the service period of the employees based on the actuarially determined cost for the period. See note 20 for further information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, the Group is acting as a lessor in leases of investment property.\n\nWhen acting as a lessee, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date when the leased asset is available for use by the Group. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Any options to extend or terminate a lease that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise are included in the lease term. The right-of-use asset is initially recognized at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments made or lease incentives received, initial direct costs and any estimated costs to dismantle or restore the leased asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis. The right-of-use asset is included in 'Property and equipment' and disclosed separately in note 13. The carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect the unwinding of the discount so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period and is reduced by the lease payments made during the period. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on a non-leveraged index or a rate. Lease liabilities are included within 'Other Liabilities.'\n\nThe Group records short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are comprised of hardware and smaller office equipment. The lease expense is included in 'Administrative and other operating expense.'\n\nWhen acting as a lessor of investment property in an operating lease, the Group follows the accounting policy in paragraph e).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Critical accounting judgments and estimates\n\nThe application of certain accounting policies requires critical accounting estimates that involve discretionary judgments and the use of assumptions which are susceptible to change due to inherent uncertainties. Because of the uncertainties involved, actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions and estimates made by management. Such critical accounting estimates are of significance to insurance reserves and deferred acquisition costs, the determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities, impairment charges, deferred taxes and employee benefits.\n\n## a) Reserves for insurance contracts and deferred acquisition costs Property & Casualty\n\nThe Group is required to establish reserves for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the Group's property & casualty products. These reserves represent the expected ultimate cost to settle claims occurring prior to, but still outstanding as of, the balance sheet date. The Group establishes its reserves by product line, type and extent of coverage and year of occurrence. There are two categories of loss reserve: reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses. Additionally, reserves are held for loss adjustment expenses, which contain the estimated legal and other expenses expected to be incurred to finalize the settlement of the losses.\n\nThe Group's reserves for reported losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates of future payments to settle reported claims. The Group bases such estimates on the facts available at the time the reserves are established. These reserves are generally established on an undiscounted basis to recognize the estimated costs of bringing pending claims to final settlement. The reserve calculation takes into account inflation, as well as other factors that can influence the amount of reserves required, some of which are subjective and some of which are dependent on future events. In determining the level of reserves, the Group considers historical trends and patterns of loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and types of coverage. In addition, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes may affect the ultimate cost of settlement and, as a result, the Group's estimation of reserves. Between the reporting and final settlement of a claim circumstances may change, which may result in changes to established reserves. Items such as changes in law and interpretations of relevant case law, results of litigation, changes in medical costs, as well as costs of vehicle and home repair materials and labor rates can substantially impact ultimate settlement costs. Accordingly, the Group reviews and re-evaluates claims and reserves on a regular basis. Amounts ultimately paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses can vary significantly from the level of reserves originally set.\n\nThe Group establishes IBNR reserves, to recognize the estimated cost of losses for events which have already occurred but which have not yet been notified. These reserves are established to recognize the estimated costs required to bring such claims to final settlement. As these losses have not yet been reported, the Group relies upon historical information and statistical models, based on product line, type and extent of coverage, to estimate its IBNR liability. The Group also uses reported claim trends, claim severities, exposure growth and other factors in estimating its IBNR reserves. These reserves are revised as additional information becomes available and as claims are actually reported.\n\nThe time required to learn of and settle claims is an important consideration in establishing the Group's reserves. Short-tail claims, such as those for motor and property damage, are normally reported soon after the incident and are generally settled within months. Long-tail claims, such as bodily injury, pollution, asbestos and product liability, can take years to develop and additional time to settle. For these claims, information concerning the event, such as the required medical treatment for bodily injury claims and the required measures to clean up pollution, may not be readily available. Accordingly, the reserving analysis of long-tail lines of business is generally more difficult and subject to greater uncertainties than for short-tail claims.\n\nSince the Group does not establish reserves for catastrophes in advance of the occurrence of such events, these events may cause volatility in the levels of its incurred losses and reserves subject to the effects of reinsurance recoveries. This volatility may also be contingent upon political and legal developments after the occurrence of the event.\n\nThe Group uses a number of accepted actuarial methods to estimate and evaluate the amount of reserves recorded. The nature of the claim being reserved for and the geographic location of the claim influence the techniques used by the Group's actuaries. Additionally, the Group's Corporate Center actuaries perform periodic reserve reviews of the Group's businesses throughout the world. Management considers the results of these reviews and adjusts its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, where necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These assumptions can vary by country, year of policy issuance and product type and are determined with reference to past experience adjusted for new trends, current market conditions and future expectations. As such the liabilities for future life policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits may not represent the ultimate amounts paid out to policyholders. For example:\n\n- - The estimated number of deaths determines the value of the benefit payments. The main source of uncertainty arises because of the potential for pandemics and wide-ranging lifestyle changes, such as changes in eating, smoking and exercise habits, which could result in earlier deaths for age groups in which the Group has significant exposure to mortality risk.\n- - For contracts that insure the risk of longevity, such as annuity contracts, an appropriate allowance is made for people living longer. Continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in further improvements in longevity in excess of those allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the Group is exposed to longevity risk.\n- - Under certain contracts, the Group has offered product guarantees (or options to take up product guarantees), including fixed minimum interest rate or mortality rate returns. In determining the value of these options and/or benefits, estimates have been made as to the percentage of contract holders that may exercise them. Changes in investment conditions could result in significantly more contract holders exercising their options and/or benefits than has been assumed.\n- - Estimates are made as to future investment income arising from the assets backing long-term insurance contracts. These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future economic and financial developments.\n- - Assumptions are determined with reference to current and historical customer data, as well as industry data. Interest rate assumptions reflect expected earnings on the assets supporting the future policyholder benefits. The information used by the Group's qualified actuaries in setting such assumptions includes, but is not limited to, pricing assumptions, available experience studies and profitability analysis.\n\nDeferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits (PVFP) are recognized on balance sheet only to the extent that they are recoverable from future policy income which also depends on the above assumptions. Recoverability is tested at contract inception and subsequently on a regular basis with reference to current expectations of future profits or margins.\n\nSee note 8 for further information on liabilities for insurance contracts and note 11 for deferred policy acquisition costs. Also refer to the insurance risk section of the risk review.\n\n## b) Fair value measurement\n\nIn determining the fair values of investments in debt and equity instruments traded on exchanges and in over-thecounter (OTC) markets, the Group makes extensive use of independent, reliable and reputable third-party pricing providers and only in rare cases places reliance on valuations that are derived from internal models.\n\nIn addition, the Group's policy is to ensure that independently sourced prices are developed by making maximum use of current observable market inputs derived from orderly transactions and by employing widely accepted valuation techniques and models. When third-party pricing providers are unable to obtain adequate observable information for a particular financial instrument, the fair value is determined either by requesting selective non-binding broker quotes or by using internal valuation models.\n\nValuations can be subject to significant judgment, especially when the fair value is determined based on at least one significant unobservable input parameter; such items are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See notes 6, 7 and 23 for further information regarding the estimate of fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When assessing impairment of available-for-sale debt securities, the Group places emphasis on issuer specific factors, such as significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency on interest or principal payments. A credit rating downgrade, worsened liquidity or decline in fair value below the weighted-average cost is not by itself considered a loss event, but rather incorporated in the impairment analysis along with other available information.\n\nThe Group determines that there is objective evidence of impairment of an available-for-sale equity security, if at the reporting date:\n\n- - its fair value is below the weighted-average cost by an amount significantly exceeding the volatility threshold determined quarterly for the respective equity market (such as North America, Asia Pacific, UK, Switzerland and other European countries); or\n- - its fair value has been below the weighted-average cost for a prolonged period of 24 consecutive months or longer.\n\n## Goodwill and attorney-in-fact (AIF) contracts\n\nGoodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) as outlined in note 3. The Group has defined the CGUs according to regions, separating Property & Casualty (P&C), Life businesses and other (see note 27). The CGUs which carry the majority of goodwill and AIF contracts are presented in table 4.\n\nFor goodwill impairment testing, the Group estimates the recoverable amount based on the value-in-use of the CGU.\n\nValue-in-use is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the CGU. Cash flow projections are based on business plan projections, which are approved by management, typically covering a three-year period or, if appropriate and adequately justified, a longer period, which may be necessary to more accurately represent the nature of the cash flows used to test the goodwill. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using, among others, estimated perpetual growth rates, which typically do not exceed the expected inflation of the geographical areas in which the cash flows supporting the goodwill are generated. If cash flows are generated in different geographical areas with different expected inflation rates, weighted averages are used. The discount rates applied reflect the respective risk-free interest rate adjusted for the relevant risk factors to the extent they have not already been considered in the underlying cash flows.\n\nThe discount rates used in the recoverable amount calculations for developed markets are based on the weighted average cost of capital and consider government bond rates which are further adjusted for equity risk premium, appropriate beta and leverage ratio. In emerging markets, discount rates are based on the U.S. dollar discount rate, taking into account inflation differential expectations and country risks. All input factors to the discount rates are based on observable market data.\n\nTable 4 sets out for the major CGUs the applied discount rates and the perpetual nominal growth rates beyond the projection period that depend on expectations about country-specific growth rates and inflation as of the date of valuation, as well as the value of goodwill and AIF contracts as of December 31, 2022.\n\nTable 4\n\n|                              | Business   | in USD   millions   |   Discount  rates in % 2022 |   Discount  rates in % 2021 |   Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in % 2022 |   Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in % 2021 |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Farmers                      | Farmers    | 3,888               |                         9.4 |                         9.2 |                                           2   |                                           2.2 |\n| North America                | P&C        | 350                 |                         9.3 |                         9   |                                           2   |                                           2.2 |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa | P&C        | 313                 |                         8.9 |                         8.3 |                                           2   |                                           1.8 |\n| Asia Pacific                 | P&C        | 781                 |                         9.8 |                         9   |                                           2.1 |                                           1.8 |\n| Asia Pacific                 | Life       | 1,120               |                        10   |                         9.1 |                                           2.1 |                                           2   |\n| Latin America                | P&C        | 316                 |                        21.1 |                        17.8 |                                           8   |                                           6   |\n| Latin America                | Life       | 74                  |                        17   |                        15.4 |                                           5.6 |                                           4.4 |\n\nDiscount and perpetual growth rates for goodwill and AIF contracts for major CGUs\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the estimated future cash flows and other assumptions deviate significantly from the Group's current outlook, there is a risk that the goodwill is impaired.\n\nQuantitative sensitivity tests have been performed for all CGUs by applying a reasonably possible change to each of the key assumptions to capture potential future variations in market conditions: a decrease in cash flows of up to 20 percent, an increase in the discount rate of 1.0 percentage point and a decrease in the perpetual growth rate of 1.0 percentage point. Under each individual scenario, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not impair goodwill and AIF contracts.\n\n## Distribution agreements\n\nQualitative analyses have been performed on distribution agreements, typically comprising an analysis of the current financial performance or any change in the conditions in the agreement and environment that would indicate an impairment. No impairment was identified.\n\nSee notes 3, 6, 13, 14 and 15 for further information on impairment of assets.\n\n## d) Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable income, including income from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies, is available for realization. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits in the period in which the underlying asset or liability is recovered or settled. If applicable tax law acknowledges different types of expenses to be tax deductible, deferred tax assets are only recognized if they give rise to deductions against the same type of taxable income. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits before the unused tax losses or tax credits expire. As of each balance sheet date, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and, if it is considered probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized, then a valuation allowance is recognized.\n\nSee note 17 for further information on deferred taxes.\n\n## e) Employee benefits\n\nThe Group provides defined benefit plans and other post-employment plans. In assessing the Group's liability for these plans, critical judgments include estimates of mortality rates, rates of employment turnover, disability, early retirement, discount rates, future salary and pension increases and increases in long-term health care costs. Discount rates for significant plans are based on a yield-curve approach. The Group sets the discount rate by creating a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the defined benefit plan. These assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in variability of pension income or expense recorded in future years.\n\nSee note 20 for further information on employee benefits.",

Acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Transactions in 2022\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Deutsche Bank Italian Financial Advisors network acquisition\n\nOn August 4, 2021, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd reached an agreement to acquire the network of Financial Advisors of the Deutsche Bank Group in Italy. The terms of the agreement provide for the transfer of a business unit, mainly active in the financial advisory and investment products offering and distribution, consisting of approximately 1,085 financial advisors, 97 employees and EUR 16.5 billion of assets under management. The acquisition allows Zurich in Italy to further develop its financial and insurance distribution network in the Italian market. On October 14, 2022, the Group, through its subsidiary Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A., completed the acquisition for USD 328 million.\n\nTable 5.1 shows the preliminary opening balance sheet line items as of the acquisition date, representing the fair value of tangible and intangible assets.\n\nTable 5.1\n\n| in USD millions, as of October 14, 2022   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | 1,092   |\n| Total investments                         | 78      |\n| Receivables and other assets              | 79      |\n| Property and equipment                    | 21      |\n| Goodwill                                  | 211     |\n| Software                                  | 1       |\n| Other intangible assets                   | 136     |\n| Assets acquired                           | 1,617   |\n| Other liabilities                         | 76      |\n| Deposits (only for banks)                 | 1,214   |\n| Liabilities acquired                      | 1,289   |\n| Net assets acquired                       | 328     |\n| Cash consideration                        | 328     |\n\n## Divestments\n\n## Held for sale\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total assets and liabilities reclassified to held for sale were USD 22.1 billion and USD 21.3 billion, respectively, as per transactions below.\n\n## Zurich Deutscher Herold Lebensversicherung Aktiengesellschaft\n\nOn June 24, 2022, Zurich Group agreed to sell its legacy traditional life insurance back book in Germany to Viridium Holding AG (Viridium), a leading specialist in the management of life insurance portfolios (run-off) in Germany.

(FGI) and Farmers Exchanges announced the acquisition of MetLife's property and casualty (P&C) business in the U.S. for a purchase price of USD 3.96 billion. The acquisition successfully closed on April 7, 2021, and the acquired P&C business has since been rebranded to Farmers Workplace Solutions (FWS). As part of the transaction in effect, FGI acquired MetLife P&C's management and administrative-related assets and liabilities to conduct its responsibilities as attorneyin-fact of the Farmers Exchanges and the Farmers Exchanges' underlying insurance business. Zurich contributed USD 2.44 billion through FGI and the Farmers Exchanges, USD 1.52 billion. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as its attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services. Attorney-in-fact services primarily include risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative and managerial functions. Fees for these services are primarily determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. Ancillary services primarily include information technology, brand advertising and certain distribution-related services that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts for which FGI acts as a principal in arranging for those services to the Exchanges.\n\nThe acquisition gives the Farmers Exchanges a truly nationwide presence and access to new distribution channels. This includes a 10-year exclusive distribution agreement through which the Farmers Exchanges are offering their personal lines products on MetLife's industry-leading U.S. Group Benefits platform, which reaches 3,800 companies and 37 million employees.\n\nTable 5.2 shows the updated opening balance sheet line items as of the acquisition date, representing the fair value of tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill was increased by USD 133 million in the second half of 2021 due to adjustments to the purchase price allocation, based on the finalization of certain tax contingencies associated with the acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These securities are therefore not derecognized from the Group's consolidated balance sheet. Cash received as collateral is recorded as an asset, and a corresponding liability is established. Interest expense is charged to income using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement.\n\nUnder a reverse repurchase agreement, the securities received are not recognized on the Group's consolidated balance sheet, as long as the risk and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the Group. The cash delivered by the Group is derecognized and a corresponding receivable is recorded within receivables and other assets. Interest income is recognized in income using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement.\n\n## Net unrealized gains/(losses) on Group investments included in equity\n\n## Securities lending, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments mainly for economic hedging purposes to mitigate risks. Such risks result from changes in interest rates, equity prices and exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are reported in receivables and other assets (see note 15) and those with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities (see note 16).\n\nTable 7.1 shows the fair value and notional amounts for all group derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 separated by risks. While these notional amounts express the extent of the Group's involvement in derivative transactions, they do not, however, represent the amounts at risk.\n\nTable 7.1\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   |                             |                             |                             |          |             | 2022        |          |             | 2021        |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount |          |             |             |          |             |             |\n|                                      |                             | 1 to 5                      |                             | Notional | Positive    | Negative    | Notional | Positive    | Negative    |\n|                                      | < 1 year                    | years                       | > 5 years                   | amounts  | fair values | fair values | amounts  | fair values | fair values |\n| Interest rate contracts  1           | 1,664                       | 8,528                       | 3,244                       | 13,436   | 508         | (956)       | 17,857   | 738         | (296)       |\n| Equity contracts                     | 957                         | 342                         | 587                         | 1,887    | 35          | (16)        | 2,522    | 57          | (65)        |\n| Foreign exchange contracts           | 20,023                      | 579                         | 130                         | 20,732   | 222         | (195)       | 18,808   | 143         | (171)       |\n| Total Group derivative               |                             |                             |                             |          |             |             |          |             |             |\n| financial instruments                | 22,645                      | 9,449                       | 3,961                       | 36,054   | 766         | (1,167)     | 39,186   | 938         | (532)       |\n| Thereof exchange-traded              | 414                         | 4                           | -                           | 418      | 9           | -           | 511      | 1           | (3)         |\n| Thereof OTC                          | 22,231                      | 9,444                       | 3,961                       | 35,636   | 756         | (1,167)     | 38,676   | 937         | (529)       |\n\n- 1 Include USD 1.2 billion and USD 1.8 billion notional related to derivatives which are centrally cleared for as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Please note that derivatives centrally cleared that are not designated under qualifying hedge accounting relationship are presented net of corresponding variation margin payments under 'Amounts due from investment brokers' (see note 15) and 'Amounts due to investment brokers' (see note 16) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Interest rate contracts\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates and to manage asset liability mismatches. Whenever possible the Group enters into exchange-traded contracts, which are standardized and regulated. Furthermore, because of the structure of the exchanges, exchange-traded contracts are not considered to carry counterparty risk. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are otherwise entered into and comprised of swaps and swaptions.\n\n## Equity contracts\n\nEquity contracts are entered into, either on a portfolio or on a macro level, to protect the fair value of equity investments against a decline in equity market prices or to manage the risk return profile of equity exposures. Short positions are always covered and sometimes used to mitigate hedging costs.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nSwaps and forward contracts are used to hedge the Group's foreign currency exposures and to manage balance sheet mismatches.\n\n## Credit contracts\n\nThe Group may from time to time enter into credit contracts. Credit contracts are credit default swaps entered into either on a portfolio or on a macro level to limit market risks arising from the investment portfolios against a change in credit spreads or to manage the risk return profile of the credit exposures. As of December 31, 2022, the Group does not hold credit default swaps.\n\n## Other contracts\n\nOther contracts predominantly include stable value products (SVPs) issued to insurance company separate accounts in connection with certain life insurance policies (Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) and Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI)) with an account value of USD 11.0 billion and USD 11.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and with a market value of the underlying investments of USD 9.9 billion and USD 11.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (not included in the table above). The Group includes the likelihood of surrender as one of the input parameters to determine the fair value of the SVPs, which was nil as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Maturity profile of notional amounts and fair values of Group derivative financial instruments\n\n<!-- image -->",

As from the date of the hedge discontinuation, the hedge adjustment of USD 29 million has been incorporated into the debt's carrying amount and is being amortized through profit or loss through the recalculated effective interest rate over the remaining life of the debt issued.\n\nInformation on debt issuances previously designated as hedged items in fair value hedge relationships is set out in note 18.\n\nThe Group also has fair value hedge relationships consisting of cross currency swaps and forwards to protect the Group from foreign currency fluctuations of certain fixed income securities and hybrid equity securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\n\nForward bonds are used to hedge the fair value of bonds against interest rates movements.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges and changes in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being hedged are both recognized in income.\n\n## Notional and fair values of Group hedge accounting derivative financial instruments",

The effective portion of the gains and losses on these swaptions is initially recognized in OCI. Subsequently, the gains or losses will be recycled to profit or loss within net investment income on Group investments over the period to December 31, 2036. The gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of these hedges are recognized immediately in income within net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for cash flow hedging to protect against the exposure to variability of cash flows attributable to interest rate and currency risk. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value, with the effective portion of changes in its fair value recognized in OCI. The effective portion, related to spot rate changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, is reclassified to profit or loss within administrative and other operating expense as an offset to foreign currency revaluation on the underlying hedged debt securities. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized in net capital gains/(losses) and impairments.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges was USD 926 million and USD 338 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Group recognized gains/(losses) of USD 31 million and USD 36 million in the consolidated income statements within net investment income on Group investments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Group also recognized net gains of USD 32 million and USD 26 million within administrative and other operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as an offset to the foreign currency revaluation on the underlying hedged items.\n\nA nil amount for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was recognized in net capital gains/(losses) and impairments due to hedge ineffectiveness. The IBOR Reform did not impact the effectiveness of the Group's hedging relationships and it is not expected to have any material impact in the future (see note 2).\n\n## Gains/(losses) arising from fair value hedges\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gains and losses on the designated hedging derivative and non-derivative financial instruments related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in OCI together with the translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment. The accumulated gains and losses in OCI are reclassified to income on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD (41) million and USD (69) million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively as a result of a hedge relationship by foreign exchange forwards and swaps.\n\nThe Group has also designated certain debt issuances as hedging instruments on a non-derivative net investment hedge relationship. The notional amount of these financial instruments was USD 12 billion and USD 11 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD 187 million and USD 171 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nInformation on debt issuances designated as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge relationship is set out in note 18.\n\nIneffectiveness of net investment hedges of USD 21 million was recognized in foreign currency translation in administrative and other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022. No ineffectiveness was recognized as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments: offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nTable 7.4 shows the net asset and liability position of Group derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. Master netting arrangements are used by the Group to provide protection against loss in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances that result in a counterparty being unable to meet its obligations. These arrangements commonly create a right of offset that becomes enforceable and affects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or other circumstances which would not be expected to arise in the normal course of business.\n\n1\n\nTable 7.4\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31                     | Derivative assets   | Derivative assets   | Derivative liabilities   | Derivative liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                        | 2022                | 2021                | 2022                     | 2021                     |\n| Netting recognized on the balance sheet                |                     |                     |                          |                          |\n| Gross amounts of financial assets and liabilities  2   | 767                 | 963                 | (1,167)                  | (532)                    |\n| Cash collateral (received)/pledged that are set off  3 | (3)                 | (25)                | -                        | -                        |\n| Net amount recognized presented in the balance sheet   | 763                 | 937                 | (1,167)                  | (532)                    |\n| Netting potential not recognized on the balance sheet  |                     |                     |                          |                          |\n| Related amounts not offset                             | (112)               | (27)                | 108                      | 30                       |\n| Cash collateral (received)/pledged  3                  | (612)               | (791)               | 337                      | 268                      |\n| Non-cash collateral (received)/pledged                 | (7)                 | (6)                 | 709                      | 72                       |\n| Net amount  4                                          | 32                  | 113                 | (8)                      | (163)                    |\n\n## Group derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements\n\n- 1 In 2022, the Group changed the presentation of table 7.4 to reflect derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting and other collateral agreements in accordance with best market practices as well SASB disclosures requirements.\n- 2   Includes USD 49.4 million and USD 0 million of derivative assets and USD 24.8 million and USD 22.0 million of derivative liabilities centrally cleared before netting against variation margin as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n- 3   Includes USD 48.9 million and USD 25.4 million of cash collateral for derivative assets as well as USD 0 million and USD 22 million of cash collateral for derivatives liabilities centrally cleared reflected through central counterparty (CCP) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n- 4   Includes USD 0.4 million and USD (0.6) million of total potential exposure to centrally cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, the Group reclassified USD 145 million of net reserves to assets and liabilities held for sale of Zurich Insurance plc (Spain Medical Malpractice portfolio) (see note 5).\n\nThe Group establishes loss reserves, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred. Reserving is a complex process dealing with uncertainty, requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments. Any changes in estimates or judgments are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which estimates and judgments are changed.\n\nSignificant delays may occur in the notification and settlement of claims, and a substantial measure of experience and judgment is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined on the basis of the information available. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.\n\n## Discounted reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\n## Development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses",

Reserves are presented by financial year, not by accident year. The reserves (and the development thereof) are for all accident years in that financial year. The top line of the table shows the estimated gross reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of each balance sheet date, which represents the estimated amount of future payments for losses incurred in that year and in prior years. The cumulative paid portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year in respect of the reserves established at each year end. Similarly, the cumulative change in reserves section details the cumulative changes in loss reserves at the end of each financial year. The net undiscounted reserves reestimated portion of the table shows the reestimation of the initially recorded reserve as of each succeeding year end. Reserve development is shown in each column. Changes to estimates are made as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial reserves were established. The cumulative deficiency or redundancy is equal to the initial net reserves less the liability reestimated as of December 31, 2022. It is the difference between the initial net reserve estimate and the last entry of the diagonal in the net undiscounted reserves reestimated portion of the table. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in the past may or may not necessarily occur in the future, and accordingly, conclusions about future results cannot be derived from the information presented in table 8.4.\n\nThe Group has considered asbestos, including latent injury, claims and claims expenses in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Group continues to be advised of indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Coverage and claim settlement issues, such as determination that coverage exists and the definition of an occurrence, together with increased medical diagnostic capabilities and awareness have often caused actual loss development to exhibit more variation than in other lines of business. Such claims require specialized reserving techniques and the uncertainty of the ultimate cost of these types of claims has tended to be greater than the uncertainty related to standard lines of business.\n\nNet reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for asbestos amounted to USD 109 million and USD 124 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nTable 8.5\n\n| in USD millions                                              | Gross    | Gross    | Ceded   | Ceded   | Ceded    | Net     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|----------|---------|\n|                                                              | 2022     | 2021     | 2022    | 2021    | 2022     | 2021    |\n| As of January 1                                              | 73,977   | 83,958   | (4,096) | (4,256) | 69,881   | 79,703  |\n| Premiums                                                     | 11,379   | 12,653   | (1,480) | (1,717) | 9,899    | 10,937  |\n| Claims                                                       | (9,787)  | (10,902) | 1,125   | 1,324   | (8,662)  | (9,578) |\n| Fee income and other expenses                                | (4,824)  | (4,341)  | 577     | 451     | (4,247)  | (3,890) |\n| Interest and bonuses credited to policyholders               | 1,214    | 1,634    | (52)    | (73)    | 1,162    | 1,561   |\n| Changes in assumptions                                       | (19)     | 14       | (1)     | -       | (19)     | 14      |\n| Acquisitions/(divestments) and transfers  1                  | (17,728) | (3,411)  | -       | 11      | (17,728) | (3,399) |\n| Increase/(decrease) recorded in   other comprehensive income | (1,085)  | (1,135)  | -       | -       | (1,085)  | (1,135) |\n| Foreign currency translation effects                         | (2,852)  | (4,494)  | 169     | 163     | (2,683)  | (4,331) |\n| As of December 31                                            | 50,275   | 73,977   | (3,758) | (4,096) | 46,517   | 69,881  |\n\n- 1 The 2022 net movement is mainly related to an agreement entered into by Zurich Investments Life S.p.A to sell part of its life and pension back book (see note 5) and an agreement entered into by Zurich Deutscher Herold Lebensversicherung Aktiengesellschaft to sell its legacy traditional life insurance book (see note 5). The 2021 net movement is mainly related to an agreement entered into by Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. to sell part of its life and pension back book (see note 5).\n\nLong-duration contract liabilities included in future life policyholder benefits result primarily from traditional participating and non-participating life insurance products. Short-duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health insurance products.\n\nFuture life policyholder benefits are generally calculated by a net premium valuation. In terms of U.S. dollars, the weighted average discount rate used in the calculation of future life policyholder benefits is 2.1 percent and 2.2 percent as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe amount of policyholder dividends to be paid is determined annually by each life insurance subsidiary. Policyholder dividends include life policyholder share of net income and unrealized appreciation of investments that are required to be allocated by the insurance contract or by local insurance regulations. Experience adjustments related to future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits vary according to the type of contract and the country. Investment, mortality and morbidity results may be passed through by experience credits or as an adjustment to the premium mechanism, subject to local regulatory provisions.\n\n## Development of future life policyholder benefits",

Property and equipment\n\nBuildings held for own use and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Generally, these assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis to profit or loss over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n- - buildings 25 to 50 years;\n- - furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years;\n- - computer equipment 3 to 6 years;\n- - other equipment 6 to 10 years (or determined by the term of lease).\n\nLand held for own use is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment loss.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Table 13.1\n\nTable 13.2\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   | Real Estate   | Real Estate   |   Equipment |   Equipment | Equipment   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n|                                      | 2022          | 2021          |        2022 |        2021 | 2022        | 2021    |\n| Right-of-use                         | 1,303         | 1,412         |          47 |          59 | 1,349       | 1,471   |\n| Owned and subject to operating lease | 436           | 501           |         439 |         464 | 876         | 965     |\n| Total                                | 1,739         | 1,912         |         486 |         523 | 2,225       | 2,436   |\n\n| in USD millions                               | Real Estate   | Real Estate    | Real Estate   | Equipment   | Equipment      | Equipment   | Total                          | Total          | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------|---------|\n|                                               | Owned         | Right-  of-use | Total         | Owned       | Right-  of-use | Total       | Owned  incl.  operating  lease | Right-  of-use | Total   |\n| Gross carrying value as of  January 1, 2022   | 571           | 2,533          | 3,104         | 1,349       | 103            | 1,452       | 1,920                          | 2,636          | 4,556   |\n| Less: accumulated  depreciation/impairments   | (70)          | (1,121)        | (1,191)       | (885)       | (44)           | (929)       | (955)                          | (1,165)        | (2,120) |\n| Net carrying value as of  January 1, 2022     | 501           | 1,412          | 1,912         | 464         | 59             | 523         | 965                            | 1,471          | 2,436   |\n| Additions and improvements                    | 22            | 55             | 76            | 105         | 14             | 119         | 127                            | 68             | 195     |\n| Lease modifications                           | -             | 42             | 42            | -           | -              | -           | -                              | 42             | 42      |\n| Depreciation and  impairments                 | (11)          | (175)          | (187)         | (107)       | (19)           | (126)       | (118)                          | (194)          | (312)   |\n| Acquisitions/(divestments)  and transfers     | (61)          | 14             | (47)          | (8)         | (5)            | (13)        | (69)                           | 10             | (59)    |\n| Foreign currency translation  effects         | (14)          | (45)           | (59)          | (14)        | (3)            | (17)        | (29)                           | (47)           | (76)    |\n| Net carrying value as of  December 31, 2022   | 436           | 1,303          | 1,739         | 439         | 47             | 486         | 876                            | 1,349          | 2,225   |\n| Plus: accumulated  depreciation/impairments   | 93            | 1,188          | 1,281         | 881         | 51             | 932         | 974                            | 1,239          | 2,213   |\n| Gross carrying value as of  December 31, 2022 | 529           | 2,490          | 3,020         | 1,320       | 97             | 1,418       | 1,850                          | 2,588          | 4,437   |\n\n## Property and equipment overview\n\n## Property and equipment current period\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under each individual scenario, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not impair goodwill and attorney-in-fact (AIF) contracts. The Group's quantitative tests support the carrying value of the goodwill in these CGUs.\n\n## Intangible assets prior period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, the income tax expense or benefit attributable to these life insurance policyholder earnings is included in income tax expense. In certain jurisdictions an accrual for future policy fees that will cover the tax charge is included in insurance benefits and losses.\n\nTaxes paid by certain of the Group's life insurance businesses are based on the investment result, and it is normal practice for certain of the Group's businesses to recover from policyholders the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result. While the relevant insurance businesses have the contractual right to charge policyholders for the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result, the obligation to pay the tax authority rests with the company and therefore the full amount of tax including the portion attributable to policyholders is accounted for as income tax. Income tax expense, therefore, includes an element attributable to policyholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Legal entities are grouped as a single taxpayer only when permitted by local legislation and when deemed appropriate. The first column of table 17.3 includes single taxpayers with a net deferred tax asset position and the second column includes single taxpayers with a net deferred tax liability position.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized, amount to approximately USD 15 billion and USD 26 billion, respectively. In the remote likelihood that these temporary differences were to reverse simultaneously, the resulting tax liabilities would be very limited due to participation exemption rules.\n\n## Deferred tax assets/(liabilities) analysis by source\n\n<!-- image -->",

The extension of the authorized share capital required the corresponding extension of the validity of the combined dilution limitations for the authorized and contingent share capital (Art. 5 bis 5 and 5 ter 1d of the Articles of Association).\n\nThe Board of ZIG is authorized to increase the share capital of ZIG by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each until April 6, 2024. An increase in partial amounts is permitted. The Board would determine the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of payment, conditions for exercising subscription rights, and the commencement of entitlement to dividends.\n\nThe Board may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a banking institution or syndicate with a subsequent offer of those shares to current shareholders. The Board may allow the expiry of subscription rights which have not been exercised, or it may place these rights as well as shares, the subscription rights of which have not been exercised, at market conditions.\n\nThe Board is further authorized to restrict or exclude the subscription rights of shareholders and to allocate them to third parties, ZIG or one of its Group companies, up to a maximum of 14,960,800 shares, if the shares are to be used:\n\n- - for the take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise or of participations or for investments by ZIG or one of its Group companies, or the financing including re-financing of such transactions; or\n- - for the purpose of expanding the scope of shareholders in connection with the quotation of shares on foreign stock exchanges or issuance of shares on the national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the conversion of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'Financial Instruments') issued by ZIG or one of its Group companies; or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of ZIG or one of its Group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nUp to April 6, 2024, the total of new shares issued from (i) authorized share capital where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,960,800 new shares.\n\n## b) Contingent share capital\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nThe extension of the authorized share capital until April 6, 2024 (see a) above) required the corresponding extension of the validity of the combined dilution limitations for authorized and contingent share capital until April 6, 2024, which was resolved at the AGM of April 6, 2022, by the shareholders (see also below). No other changes were resolved with respect to the contingent share capital.\n\n## Share capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The subscription rights are excluded. The then-current owners of the Financial Instruments shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares. The conversion and/or option conditions are to be determined by the Board.\n\nThe Board is authorized, when issuing Financial Instruments to restrict or exclude the advance subscription rights in cases where they are issued:\n\n- - for the financing including re-financing of a take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise, or of participations or of investments by ZIG or one of its Group companies; or\n- - on national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of ZIG or one of its Group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIf the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded by a resolution of the Board, the following applies: the Financial Instruments are to be issued at prevailing market conditions (including standard dilution protection clauses in accordance with market practice) and the setting of the conversion or issue price of the new shares must take due account of the stock market price of the shares and/or comparable instruments priced by the market at the time of issue or time of conversion.\n\nThe conversion rights may be exercisable during a maximum of ten years and option rights during a maximum of seven years from the time of the respective issue; contingent conversion features may remain in place indefinitely.\n\nUp to April 6, 2024, the total of new shares issued from (i) authorized share capital where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,960,800 new shares.\n\n## Employee participation\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, no shares were issued to Group employees out of the contingent share capital. As of December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2021, the remaining contingent share capital available for issuance to Group employees amounted to CHF 409,509.20 and 4,095,092 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, respectively. Subscription rights, as well as advance subscription rights of the shareholders are excluded. The issuance of new shares or respective option rights to employees is subject to one or more regulations to be issued by the Board and taking into account performance, functions, levels of responsibility and criteria of profitability. New shares or option rights may be issued to employees at a price lower than that quoted on the stock exchange.\n\n## c) Additional paid-in capital\n\nThis reserve is not ordinarily available for distribution. However, as of January 1, 2011, a Swiss tax regulation based on the Swiss Corporate Tax Reform II became effective, allowing for payments free of Swiss withholding tax to shareholders out of the capital contribution reserve, created out of additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, the general capital contribution reserve amounted to CHF 6 million.\n\n## d) Treasury shares\n\nTable 19.2\n\n| number of shares, as of December 31                                         | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Treasury shares                                                             | 2,097,833 | 2,169,197 | 1,964,106 |\n| Treasury shares (repurchased under the public share buyback program, see f) | 829,830   | -         | -         |\n| Total treasury shares                                                       | 2,927,663 | 2,169,197 | 1,964,106 |\n\nTreasury shares comprise shares acquired in the market as well as shares repurchased via the public share buyback program for cancellation purposes (see f) below).\n\n## Treasury shares",

On November 21, 2022, ZIG launched the public share buyback program of up to CHF 1,800 million. As per December 31, 2022, ZIG repurchased on a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange 829,830 ZIG shares, having a repurchase value of CHF 373 million.

Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of retirement benefit arrangements for employees. Historically, the majority of employees belonged to defined benefit pension plans and some will still have past service benefits accrued in those plans.\n\nHowever, the majority of employees now accrue benefits under defined contribution plans, which provide benefits equal to the amounts contributed by both the employer and the employee plus investment returns.\n\nCertain of the Group's operating companies also provide post-employment benefit plans covering medical care and life insurance, mainly in the U.S. Eligibility for these plans is generally based on completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. The plans typically pay a stated percentage of medical expenses subject to deductibles and other factors. The cost of post-employment benefits is accrued during the employees' service periods.\n\nThe Group Pensions Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and advising on the Group governance framework in matters related to pension and post-employment benefit arrangements. It provides oversight and guidance in the areas of market, demographic and reputational risk. It reports to and makes recommendations to the Group Balance Sheet Committee on material pension-related matters and reports regularly to the Remuneration Committee. The Group Pensions Committee provides a point of focus and coordination on the topic of pensions and post-retirement benefits at Group level for the supervision and exercise of company powers and obligations in relation to pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n\nFunding and asset allocation is subject to local legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## a) Defined contribution pension plans\n\nCertain companies of the Group sponsor defined contribution pension plans. Eligibility for participation in such plans is either immediate on commencement of employment or based on completion of a specified period of continuous service. The plans provide for voluntary contributions by employees and contributions by the employer which typically range from 2 percent to 13 percent of annual pensionable salary, depending on a number of factors. The Group's contributions under these plans amounted to USD 301 million and USD 289 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## b) Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe largest defined benefit obligations are in the pension plans in Switzerland, the UK, the U.S. and Germany, which together comprise over 90 percent of the Group's total defined benefit obligation. The remaining plans in other countries are not individually significant; therefore, no separate disclosure is provided.\n\nCertain Group companies provide defined benefit pension plans, some of which provide benefits on retirement, death or disability related to employees' service periods and pensionable earnings. Others provide cash balance plans where the participants receive the benefit of the accumulated employer and employee contributions (where paid) together with additional cash credits in line with the rules of the plan.\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are funded through contributions by the Group and, in some cases also by employees, to investment vehicles managed by trusts or foundations independent of the Group's finances, or by management committees with fiduciary responsibilities. Where a trust or foundation exists, it is required by law or by articles of association to act in the interests of the fund and of all relevant beneficiaries to the plan, which can also include the sponsoring company, and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The trust/foundation board or committee is usually composed of representatives from both employers and plan members. Independent actuarial valuations for the plans are performed as required. It is the Group's general principle that plans are appropriately funded in accordance with local pension regulations in each country.\n\nThe pension plans typically expose the company to risks such as interest rate, price inflation, longevity and salary increases. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risk but introduce some investment risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual asset allocation is determined by reference to current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. The Group has a governance framework to ensure the trust/foundation board or committee considers how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the potential impact on the funding status of the plans, including short-term liquidity requirements. The investment strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the governance body in each country, with oversight by the Group Pensions Committee. The pension assets are invested in diversified portfolios across geographical regions and asset classes to ensure diversified returns, also taking into account local pension laws. The investment strategies aim to mitigate asset-liability mismatches in the long run. In recent years, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors has become a significant element of Zurich's pension plans' investment decision making. Pension plans will continue progressing on their responsible investment journey, leveraging Zurich's expertise and leadership while being cognizant of their fiduciary responsibility.\n\nFor post-employment defined benefit plans, total contributions to funded plans and benefits paid directly by the Group were USD 289 million for 2022 compared with USD 331 million for 2021. The estimated total for 2023 is USD 320 million (actual amount may differ).\n\n## Swiss pension plan\n\nThe main plan provides benefits that exceed the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law. It provides a lifetime pension to members based on their accrued retirement savings in the basic and additional accounts multiplied by the applicable conversion rate at the normal retirement age of 65 (age 62 for Executive Staff). Participants can draw retirement benefits early from age 60 (age 58 for Executive Staff). Alternatively, the benefit can be taken as a lump sum payment at retirement. In addition, at retirement, the plan pays a one-off cash sum settlement equal to the accrued retirement savings in the capital account. Contributions to the plan are paid by the employees and the employer, both for retirement savings and to finance risk benefits paid out in the event of death and disability. The accumulated balance on the pension account is based on the employee and employer pension contributions and interest accrued. The interest rate credited is defined annually by the plan's Board of Trustees which is responsible for the governance of the plan. The trustees review the Pension Plan's funding status regularly as well as the technical interest rate and the conversion rates. The conversion rate at age 65 is currently being phased down to 5 percent until 2023. In 2018, both the employer and employee savings contributions were increased. The insured salary was increased by reducing the coordination deduction. The flexibility of the plan was improved by introducing three levels of savings. Top-up payments from the company were introduced to those members' pension accounts which had been part of the plan in 2017 and were affected by the changes. For them, this ensures that expected benefits at normal retirement age will be at least equal to 98.5 percent of their pensions expectations under the previous conversion rates. The top-up payments will be made until 2023.\n\nAlthough the Swiss plan operates like a defined contribution plan under local regulations, it is accounted for as a defined benefit pension plan under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' because of the need to accrue a minimum level of interest on the mandatory part of the pension accounts and the payment of a lifetime pension at a fixed conversion rate under the plan rules.\n\nActuarial valuations are completed annually and if the plan becomes underfunded under local regulations, options for dealing with this include the Group paying additional contributions into the plan and/or reducing future benefits. At present, the plan is sufficiently funded, meaning that no additional contributions into the plans are expected to be required in the next year. The investment strategy of the Swiss plan is constrained by Swiss pension law including regulations related to diversification of plan assets. Under IAS 19, volatility arises in the Swiss pension plan net asset because the fair value of the plan assets is not directly correlated to movements in the value of the plan's defined benefit obligation in the short-term.\n\nIf the fair value of plan assets exceeds the plan's defined benefit obligation, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does not exceed the estimated future economic benefit. The value of the future economic benefit is estimated as the sum of two items: the difference between the present value of the estimated future net service cost and the present value of estimated future employer contributions, plus employer contribution reserves in accordance with local Swiss regulations.",

Normal retirement age for the plan is 60. The plan is split into distinct defined benefit sections which are closed to new entrants and, with effect from January 1, 2016, to future benefit accrual. All employees now participate in a defined contribution section within the same trust. The notes that follow consider only the defined benefit sections. The UK Pension Trustee Board is responsible for the governance of the plan. The employer contributions are determined based on regular triennial actuarial valuations which are conducted using assumptions agreed by the Trustee Board and the sponsoring company. A local statutory valuation was carried out at an effective date of June 30, 2019, and was finalized in September 2020. This valuation disclosed a funding surplus of USD 86 million (GBP 63 million) after taking into account the value of the asset-backed funding arrangement established in 2014. The statutory valuation as of June 30, 2022, is underway and expected to be finalized by September 2023. The asset-backed funding arrangement does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS19 and is therefore not included in the tables set out in the rest of this note.\n\nThe ongoing funding of the plan is closely monitored by the Trustee Board and a dedicated funding committee is made up of representatives from the Trustee Board and the Group. The plan rules and UK pension legislation set out maximum levels of inflationary increases applied to plan benefits. The plan assets are invested in diversified classes of assets.\n\n## U.S. pension plans\n\nThere are two major pension plans in the U.S., the Zurich North America (ZNA) pension plan and the Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) pension plan. Both plans are funded entirely by the participating employers. The ZNA plan is a cash balance and the FGI pension plan utilizes a cash balance pension formula for benefits accruing after January 1, 2009, except with respect to certain grandfathered participants who retained a final average pay formula. Under a cash balance pension formula, an amount is credited to the cash balance account each quarter, determined by an employee's age, service and their level of earnings up to and above the social security taxable wage base. The minimum annual interest credited on the account balance is 5 percent. The cash balance account is available from age 65, or age 55 with five years of service. The benefit can be taken as a monthly annuity or as a lump sum. Both the ZNA plan and the FGI pension plan have fiduciaries as required under local pension laws. The fiduciaries are responsible for the governance of the plans. Actuarial valuations are completed regularly. The annual employer minimum required contributions are equal to expected expenses paid from the plan each year, plus a rolling amortization of any prior underfunding.\n\nThe ZNA and FGI plans have been frozen with effect from December 31, 2018. ZNA and FGI employees with a cash balance account will continue to earn interest credits on their existing cash balance account balance after the freeze date and will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and early retirement eligibility. FGI employees participating in the final average pay formula will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and the percentage of pension benefit payable for early retirement before normal retirement age of 65. ZNA and FGI employees earn only defined contribution retirement benefits with effect from January 1, 2019. In conjunction with the change in the pension plan, ZNA and FGI employees receive an additional company contribution within their defined contribution plan.\n\n## German pension plans\n\nThere are a number of legacy defined benefit plans in Germany, most of which were set up under works council agreements. Contributions to support the pension commitments are made to a contractual trust arrangement. A separate arrangement was also established in 2010 to provide for retirement obligations that were in payment at that time. Consideration is given from time to time based on the fiscal efficiency of adding recent retirees to this arrangement and to adding assets to the contractual trust. In 2022 the pension liabilities are nearly fully funded; therefore, no additional funding was required.\n\nThe defined benefit plans provide benefits on either a final salary, career average salary or a cash balance basis. New entrants participate in a cash balance arrangement, which has the characteristics of a defined contribution arrangement, with a lump sum paid at retirement and a capital guarantee on members' balances, which mirrors the capital guarantee given in a conventional life insurance arrangement in Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the UK, where price inflation is required for projecting benefits in those calculations, this is done using the full breakeven price inflation curve. The figures for discount rates and for UK price inflation in table 20.4 are singleequivalent rates for the defined benefit obligations (i.e., the single assumption that would produce the same defined benefit obligation as using the full curve); single-equivalent rates for other elements of the accounting results will differ slightly from the figures set out below.\n\n## Table 20.4\n\nTable 20.5a\n\n| as of December 31                   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021       | 2022 2021      | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021       | 2022 2021      | 2022 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|\n|                                     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     |\n| Discount rate                       | 2.2%        | 4.8%            | 5.4%           | 3.7%        | 0.2%        | 1.8%            | 2.8%           | 1.1%        |\n| Inflation rate (CPI)  1             | 1.2%        | 2.6%            | 2.5%           | 2.6%        | 1.0%        | 2.2%            | 2.7%           | 2.2%        |\n| Salary increase rate                | 1.2%        | 2.8%            | 5.0%           | 3.9%        | 1.0%        | 2.8%            | 5.2%           | 3.5%        |\n| Expected future   pension increases | 0.1%        | 3.4%            | n / a          | 2.6%        | 0.1%        | 3.5%            | n / a          | 2.2%        |\n| Interest crediting rate  2          | 2.2%        | n / a           | 5.4%           | n / a       | 1.0%        | n / a           | 5.0%           | n / a       |\n\n- 1 In the UK, part of the liability is linked to the inflation measure of the Retail Price Index (RPI), which is assumed to be 1.0 percent higher than the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. As RPI is expected to converge with CPI no earlier than in 2030, the RPI assumption for the UK was assumed to be 1.0 percent higher than CPI for durations up to and including 2029 and the same as CPI for 2030 onwards.\n- 2   As of December 31, 2022, the disclosed assumption for the U.S. is calculated as a weighted average of ZNA pension plans and the FGI pension plans.\n\nTables 20.5a and 20.5b set out the life expectancies used in the valuation of the Group's major plans. The mortality assumptions in each country have been based on mortality tables in accordance with typical practice in that country.\n\n| in years, as of December 31, 2022   |                                                                                                                            | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a female currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a female currently   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                     |                                                                                                                            | aged 65                                          | aged 45                                          | aged 65                                            | aged 45                                            |\n| Country                             | Mortality table for major plans BVG 2020 with generational  projections according to CMI  model adapted to Swiss mortality | 21.84                                            | 23.50                                            | 23.59                                              | 25.18                                              |\n| Switzerland United Kingdom          | with a long-term trend rate of 1.25% SAPS Series 3 with CMI\\_2021  projection with plan specific  adjustments               | 22.06                                            | 23.30                                            | 24.11                                              | 25.58                                              |\n|                                     | Pri-2012 with MP-2020  Generational projection and   white collar adjustment                                               | 21.84                                            | 23.22                                            | 23.24                                              | 24.60                                              |\n| United States                       | Pri-2012 with MP-2021  Generational projection and   white collar adjustment                                               | 21.97                                            | 23.35                                            | 23.39                                              | 24.75                                              |\n| Germany                             | Heubeck 2018G                                                                                                              | 20.62                                            | 23.36                                            | 24.04                                              | 26.26                                              |\n\n## Key financial assumptions used for major plans\n\n## Mortality tables and life expectancies for major plans current period",

The effect on the defined benefit obligation shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the overall defined benefit obligation. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for different plans. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the evaluation of the defined benefit obligation under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall defined benefit obligation. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent the Group's view of expected future changes in the defined benefit obligation. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis.\n\nTable 20.7\n\n|                                           | Defined benefit obligation  1   | Defined benefit obligation  1   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| in USD millions, as of December 31        | 2022                            | 2021                            |\n| Discount rate +50 bps                     | 978                             | 1,851                           |\n| Discount rate -50 bps                     | (1,096)                         | (2,112)                         |\n| Salary increase rate +50 bps              | (38)                            | (78)                            |\n| Salary decrease rate -50 bps              | 37                              | 75                              |\n| Price inflation increase rate +50 bps     | (651)                           | (1,245)                         |\n| Price inflation decrease rate -50 bps     | 594                             | 1,122                           |\n| Cash balance interest credit rate +50 bps | (62)                            | (80)                            |\n| Cash balance interest credit rate -50 bps | 59                              | 54                              |\n| Mortality 10% increase in life expectancy | (1,109)                         | (2,294)                         |\n| Mortality 10% decrease in life expectancy | 1,140                           | 2,239                           |\n\n- 1 A negative number indicates an increase and a positive number indicates a decrease in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions",

Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group has adopted various share-based compensation and cash incentive plans to attract, retain and motivate employees. The plans are designed to reward employees for their contribution to the performance of the Group and to encourage employee share ownership. Share-based compensation plans include performance-based share plans and employee share purchase plans. Share-based compensation plans are based on the provision of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares.\n\n## a) Cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) is utilized across the Group and, in many countries covers all employees in that country who are selected to participate in a short-term incentive plan. In addition, there may be other local short-term incentive plans in place. Awards are made in cash, based on the accomplishment of both organizational and individual performance objectives. The expense recognized for these cash incentive plans amounted to USD 607 million and USD 597 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## b) Share-based compensation plans for employees\n\nThe Group encourages employees to own shares in Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and has set up a framework based on the implementation of performance share programs. Actual plans are tailored to meet local market requirements.\n\nThe cost of share-based payments depends on various factors, including achievement of targets, and are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and the Board. Costs may therefore vary significantly from year to year. The net amounts of USD 246 million and USD 279 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, reflect all aspects of share-based compensation, including adjustments made during the year.\n\nThe explanations below provide a more detailed overview of the main plans of the Group.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\n## Share incentive plans for employees in the UK\n\nThe Group established an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan and launched the Partnership Shares element of this plan in 2003, which enabled participating employees to make monthly purchases of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares at the prevailing market price from their gross earnings. This plan was terminated in 2007. There were 9 and 16 participants in the plan as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nA revised Partnership Share Scheme was launched in March 2013. Participants benefit from purchasing shares by making deductions from gross salary up to a maximum of GBP 1,800 or 10 percent of their year-to-date earnings. There were 744 and 694 active participants in the plan as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Group also operates a profit-sharing element of the Share Incentive Plan (Reward Shares) which was launched in 2004 with annual share allocations being made in May each year subject to business performance. The awards are based on business operating profit (BOP) after tax for the year achieved by the business unit of each participating employee. Individual awards are subject to a maximum of 5 percent of a participant's base salary (before any flexible benefit adjustments) with an overall maximum of GBP 3,600. The total number of participating employees in Reward Shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 4,319 and 3,997, respectively.\n\nA Dividend Shares scheme was launched in 2014 which allows employees to reinvest their dividends from Partnership Shares and Reward Shares. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 569 and 564 participants in the scheme, respectively.\n\n## Share incentive plan for employees in Switzerland\n\nUnder the Employee Share Plan, eligible employees are allowed to acquire sales-restricted shares at a 30 percent discount to the market value. The maximum permitted investment at the preferential price in shares is equivalent to CHF 3,500 per employee per annum. During 2022, 4,515 employees were eligible to participate in the plan, compared with 4,383 in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 2,331 and 2,240 employees, respectively, purchased shares under the 2022 and 2021 share plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The number of PSUs is calculated as a percentage of the annual base salary of each participant. To further align participants with the interests of shareholders, PSUs are credited with dividend equivalent units (DEUs) during the vesting period to compensate participants in LTIP for dividends paid to shareholders.\n\nPSUs allocated in 2022 will vest after a period of three years following the year of allocation (three-year cliff vesting), with the actual level of vesting between 0 percent and 200 percent of the overall target shares (PSUs allocated and DEUs that accrued during the vesting period), depending on the achievement of pre-defined performance criteria. The performance criteria used to determine the level of vesting are the Group's net income attributable to shareholders' return on common shareholders' equity (NIAS ROE), the position of its relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured against an international peer group of insurance companies, and the achievement of cash remittance targets. The three pre-defined performance criteria are each assessed over a period of three consecutive financial years starting in the year of allocation and have an equal weighting. One half of the shares that vest are sales-restricted for a further three years for members of the Executive Committee. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 there were 1,305 and 1,228 participants in this plan, respectively.\n\nTable 21\n\n| for the years ended December 31    | Number   | Number   |   Fair value at the   allocation date (in CHF)  1 |   Fair value at the   allocation date (in CHF)  1 |\n|------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                    | 2022     | 2021     |                                              2022 |                                              2021 |\n| Shares allocated during the period | 408,015  | 422,606  |                                               451 |                                               406 |\n\n- 1 Fair value measured using the market price of the shares at the allocation date and volatility indicators.\n\nThe shares allocated each year are based on parameters under the Group's LTIP.

Commitments and contingencies, legal proceedings and regulatory investigations\n\nThe Group has provided contractual commitments and financial guarantees to external parties, associates and joint ventures as well as partnerships. These arrangements include commitments under certain conditions to make liquidity advances to cover default principal and interest payments, make capital contributions or provide equity financing.\n\nTable 22\n\n| in USD millions                                      | 12/31/2022   | 12/31/2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Remaining commitments under investment agreements  1 | 1,045        | 1,065        |\n| Guarantees and letters of credit  2                  | 838          | 978          |\n| Undrawn loan commitments                             | -            | 1            |\n| Other commitments and contingent liabilities  3      | 427          | 717          |\n\n- 1 Amount in 2021 restated as private debt investments are not required to be reported as commitments (soft commitments).\n- 2   Guarantee features embedded in life insurance products are not included.\n- 3   Includes USD 11 million future cash outflows in 2022 and USD 79 million future cash outflows in 2021 that the Group as lessee is potentially exposed to which are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\n## Commitments under investment agreements\n\nThe Group has committed to contribute capital to third parties that engage in making investments in direct private equity, private equity funds, private debt and real estate. Commitments may be called by the counterparty over the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis.\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, USD 572 million and USD 643 million, respectively, related to guarantees in the aggregate amount of GBP 475 million which were provided to the directors of a wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the repatriation of capital. These guarantees have no expiry date.\n\nThe Group knows of no event of default that would require it to satisfy financial guarantees. Irrevocable letters of credit have been issued to secure certain reinsurance contracts.\n\nThe Group is active in numerous countries where insurance guarantee funds exist. The design of such funds varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some, funding is based on premiums written; in others, the Group may be called upon to contribute to such funds in case of a failure of another market participant. In addition, in some jurisdictions the amount of contribution may be limited, for example, to a percentage of the net underwriting reserve net of payments already made.\n\nThe Group carries certain contingencies in the ordinary course of business in connection with the sale of its companies\n\nand businesses. These are primarily in the form of indemnification obligations provided to the acquirer in a transaction\n\nin which a Group company is the seller. They vary in scope and duration by counterparty and generally are intended to\n\nshift the potential risk of certain unquantifiable and unknown loss contingencies from the acquirer to the seller.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd has provided unlimited guarantees in support of entities belonging to the Zurich Capital Markets group of companies.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has received notices from various tax authorities asserting deficiencies in taxes for various years. The Group is of the view that the ultimate outcome of these reviews will not materially affect the Group's consolidated financial position.\n\nThe Group has commitments to provide collateral on certain contracts in the event of a financial strength downgrading for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd from the current AA by Standard & Poor's. Should the rating by Standard & Poor's fall to A+, then the additional collateral based on information available amounts to nil as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nIn common with other insurance companies, the Group is mindful of the trend toward enhanced consumer protection. There is significant uncertainty about the ultimate cost this trend might have on our business. The main areas of uncertainty concern court decisions as well as the volume of potential customer complaints related to sales activities and withdrawal rights, and their respective individual assessments.\n\n## Quantifiable commitments and contingencies",

The total amount of pledged financial assets including the securities under short-term sale and repurchase agreements amounted to USD 2.2 billion and USD 2.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nTerms and conditions associated with the financial assets pledged to secure the Group's liabilities are usual and standard in the markets in which the underlying agreements were executed.\n\n## Legal, compliance and regulatory developments\n\nThe Group's business is subject to extensive supervision, and the Group is in regular contact with various regulatory authorities. The Group is also involved in legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of its business operations in various jurisdictions where it operates. In addition, the Group and/or its subsidiaries are involved in legal matters arising out of transactions involving the transfer of portfolios or businesses. These legal matters can include claims brought by purchasers or other parties asserting claims for damages on various theories, including failure to disclose material information, failure to perform contractual duties or otherwise seeking to impose liability on the Group and/or its subsidiaries. With respect to significant legal or regulatory matters, the Group considers the likelihood of a negative outcome, and when the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated, a reserve or provision is established to record the estimated loss for the expected outcome. While the Group believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its subsidiaries the subject of, any unresolved current legal proceedings, claims, litigation and investigations that will have a material adverse effect on the Group's consolidated financial condition, proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the outcome of any proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in the particular reporting period in which it is resolved.\n\n- - Specifically, COVID-19-related coverage litigation: Several of the Group's subsidiaries as well as other insurance companies are involved in litigation relating to the extent to which COVID-19 was intended to be covered under Property Damage Business Interruption policies. A limited number of class actions have also been initiated. Most of the litigation has been filed in United States courts in addition to test cases filed in Australia and some in the UK, which have predominantly found in favor of insurers. The final determination of outcomes may take many years as appeals are pursued by the plaintiffs and insurers, including the Group or its subsidiaries.\n- - In 2016, the Group, on its own initiative, undertook an internal review of the life insurance, savings and pension business sold by its non-U.S. operating companies with relevant cross-border business to customers with a nexus to the U.S. The review confirmed that the Group's cross-border business with U.S. persons was very limited and of a legacy nature, with the large majority of sales having occurred more than a decade ago. The review also confirmed that the Group's U.S. operating companies were not involved in or connected to those activities. The Group voluntarily disclosed the results of the review and the regulatory issues presented by sales to U.S. residents to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other authorities. The Group continues to cooperate with these authorities.\n\nIn April 2019, the DOJ announced that Zurich Life Insurance Company Ltd (ZLIC) and Zurich International Life Limited (ZILL) entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the DOJ, which memorializes the DOJ's decision not to prosecute these entities for any U.S. tax-related offenses in connection with legacy cross-border sales to U.S. persons. Under the terms of the NPA, ZLIC and ZILL have agreed to comply with certain specified conditions during the four-year term of the NPA.\n\nThis resolution has not had, and will not have, an adverse effect on the Group's business or consolidated financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fair value measurement\n\nTo measure fair value, the Group gives the highest priority to quoted and unadjusted prices in active markets. In the absence of quoted prices, fair values are calculated through valuation techniques, making the maximum use of relevant observable market data inputs. Whenever observable parameters are not available, the inputs used to derive the fair value are based on common market assumptions that market participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities. Depending on the observability of prices and inputs to valuation techniques, the Group classifies instruments measured at fair value within the following three levels (the fair value hierarchy):\n\nLevel 1 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined directly from unadjusted current quoted prices resulting from orderly transactions in active markets for identical assets/liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using significant inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable market inputs.\n\nLevel 3 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using valuation techniques with at least one significant input not being based on observable market data. This approach is used only in circumstances when there is little, if any, market activity for a certain instrument, and the Group is required to rely on third-party providers or develop internal valuation inputs based on the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe governance framework and oversight of the Group's standards and procedures regarding the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value lies within the responsibility of Group Risk Management, Group Investment Management, Treasury Capital Management and Group Finance. Specialists from these departments ensure the adequacy of valuation models, approve methodologies and sources to derive model input parameters, provide oversight over the selection of third-party pricing providers, and on a semi-annual basis review the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the financial instruments in scope.\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of third-party pricing providers to determine the fair values of its available-for-sale and fair value through profit or loss financial instruments, and only in rare cases places reliance on prices that are derived from internal models. Investment accounting, operations and process functions are independent from those responsible for buying and selling the assets, and are responsible for receiving, challenging and verifying values provided by third-party pricing providers to ensure that fair values are reliable, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable accounting and valuation policies. There are quality control procedures used depend on the nature and complexity of the invested assets. They include variance and stale price analysis, and comparisons with fair values of similar instruments and with alternative values obtained from asset managers and brokers. Model review activities are also conducted for evaluated prices supplied by third parties to verify that their valuation processes, methodologies, models, and governance and control framework comply with applicable internal guidance, and that the allocation of those instruments within the fair value hierarchy is adequate. They include the compilation and review of relevant documentation as well meetings with third-party representatives to supplement the analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsequently, available-forsale financial assets, fair value through profit or loss financial assets, and derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date. All other financial instruments are carried at amortized cost. The valuation techniques used to determine fair value measurement are described below.\n\nFair values of held-to-maturity debt securities and senior and subordinated debt are obtained from third-party pricing providers. The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in an active market for identical assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 2.\n\nDiscounted cash flow models are used for mortgage loans and other loans (except for loans classified as private debt). The discount yields in these models use interest rates that reflect the return a market participant would expect to receive on instruments with similar remaining maturities, cash flow patterns, currencies, credit risk and collateral. Such instruments are categorized within level 3.\n\nDifferent valuation techniques are used to value private debt instruments, including the income approach (such as discounted cash flow models) or the market approach (such as relative value models). Where prices are obtained from an evaluated pricing service from a data vendor in which price transparency data indicates no use of significant unobservable inputs, they are categorized within Level 2. All other prices are classified to Level 3 unless factual evidence indicates that unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to investment contracts and investment contracts with DPF are determined using discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 3 due to the unobservability of certain inputs used in the valuation.\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities",

The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in an active market for similar assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated on the basis of information from external pricing providers or internal pricing models (for example, discounted cash flow models or other recognized valuation techniques).\n\nWhere there are active and transparent real estate markets and no significant adjustments to the observable data are required, the investment property held by the Group is classified within level 2.\n\nOver-the-counter derivative financial instruments are valued using internal models and third-party valuation services. The fair values are determined using dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, which use various inputs including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, time to expiry, yield curves and volatility of underlying instruments. Such instruments are classified within level 2 as the inputs used in pricing models are generally market observable or derived from market observable data.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts are usually determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying assets backing these liabilities. Such instruments are classified within level 2.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked current period\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked prior period\n\n<!-- image -->",

The valuations of such instruments are obtained from quarterly net asset value information from the fund manager and annual audited financial statements provided by the issuing company. The prices are generally derived for each underlying company in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines, using discounted cash flows (income approach) or multiple methods (market approach). The Group has only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers; hence, a narrative sensitivity analysis is not applicable.\n- - Non-agency MBS, ABS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO) rated below 'AAA' and private debt holdings including certain private placements that are valued by independent pricing providers or external asset managers using primarily the discounted cash flow method with significant unobservable input parameters such as asset prepayment rate, default rates and credit spreads. A significant market yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a decreased fair value, while a significant market yield decrease could result in an increased fair value. However, a reasonable variation in the option-adjusted spread taken from a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics has only immaterial impact on fair value.\n- - All investment properties for which there are no active and transparent real estate markets or observable data available. The valuation for majority of these investment properties - other than certain investment properties located in Switzerland - are typically performed annually by independent qualified appraisers. The parameters used for the valuations are specific to each country or region and vary significantly across different markets. External appraisals are reviewed by internal real estate valuation specialists; however, since the unobservable inputs were not developed by the Group they are not readily available. In some cases, where external valuations are obtained at least every three years, interim valuations by internal valuation specialists are performed. During 2022, Zurich refined its valuation model for investment properties located in Switzerland to align more closely to the market practice. The refined valuation model is based on a discounted cash flow method and is applied to each individual property based on its expected cash flows. The unobservable input parameters include the future transition cost for carbon emission and capital expenditures to achieve the desired environmental footprint depending on the current condition of each individual property. These input parameters are combined into a synthetic spread applied to the otherwise observable discount rate. The refined methodology (including market movements from the previous valuation date) resulted in an increase in fair value of the investment property by USD 550 million.\n- - Overall, as of December 31, 2022, around 30 percent of level 3 investment properties were covered by internal valuations. Significant increases/(decreases) in synthetic spread, in isolation, would result in a lower/(higher) fair value measurement. For example, an increase in spread of 10bps, considered in isolation, would result in a decrease in fair value of 3% or approximately USD 180 million as of December 31, 2022.\n- - Options and long-dated derivative financial instruments with fair values determined using counterparty valuations or calculated using significant unobservable inputs such as historical volatilities, historical correlation, implied volatilities from the counterparty or derived using extrapolation techniques. Quantitative information on unobservable inputs is not available when counterparty pricing was used. For internally calculated fair values, significant increases/(decreases) in volatilities or correlation would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement; however, the overall effect on the Group's financial statements would not be material.\n- - Reinsurers' share of liabilities and liabilities for insurance contracts fair value option. The fair values are determined using discounted cash flow models. The discount factors used are based on derived rates for LIBOR swap forwards, spreads to U.S. Treasuries and spreads to U.S. corporate A or higher rated bond segments for financials, industrials and utilities. The liability-projected cash flows use contractual information for premiums, benefits and agent commissions, administrative expenses under third-party administrative service agreements and best estimate parameters for policy decrements. The primary unobservable inputs are the policy decrement assumptions used in projecting cash flows. These include disability claim parameters for incidence and termination (whether for recovery or death) and lapse rates. Significant increases/(decreases) in claim incidence rates and significant decreases/(increases) in claim termination rates would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement.\n\nFor details on Group investments sensitivities, refer to section analysis by risk type in the risk review.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy is reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether significant transfers between levels have occurred. Transfers between levels mainly arise as a result of changes in market activity and observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of certain instruments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group recorded a transfer of USD 430 million of unit-linked fair value through profit or loss equity securities out of level 2 into level 1 for mutual funds with daily published prices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For further information on the Group's eligibility to the temporary exemption from IFRS 9, please refer to note 2.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the classification and measurement of all debt instruments will be driven by the business model in which these assets are held and by their contractual terms. The combined effect of the application of the business model and contractual cash flows characteristics determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value with changes recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss. The business model will be assessed at the date of the initial application of IFRS 9.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding will be measured at either amortized cost or at fair value with changes recognized in OCI, unless they are managed on a fair value basis. The assessment of the features of the contractual terms is referred to as the SPPI test. Debt instruments that do not pass the SPPI test will always be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments including fund investments will be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The Group does not intend to make use of the election to present changes in fair value of certain equity instruments that are not held for trading in OCI with no subsequent reclassification of realized gains or losses to the income statement.\n\n- - Financial assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are SPPI;\n- - Other financial assets not passing the SPPI test, as well as financial assets managed on a fair value basis for which no SPPI assessment has been performed. Financial assets that have not passed the SPPI test include equities, callable bonds with significant prepayment features, hybrid bonds with certain cash flows at the discretion of the issuer and some ABS/MBS that do not fulfill the SPPI criteria for contractually linked instruments.\n\nNet unrealized gains/(losses) on debt securities available for sale that are not SPPI amounted to USD (686) million and USD 212 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The carrying value on held-to-maturity debt securities, mortgage loans, other loans, and receivables include impairment allowances of USD 329 million and USD 320 million of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Development of allowance for impairments current period\n\n## Development of allowance for impairments prior period",

Thus, the same ECL requirements will apply to all financial assets measured at amortized cost and those measured at fair value with changes recognized in OCI.\n\nAt initial recognition of a debt instrument, a loss allowance is recognized for expected credit losses resulting from default events within the next 12 months after the reporting date (12-month ECL). Such instruments are classified as Stage 1. The Group does not originate or acquire financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition.\n\nIn the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, IFRS 9 requires the ECL allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL). Such instruments are referred to as Stage 2.\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets split by SPPI and other financial assets current period\n\nFair value and carrying value of financial assets split by SPPI and other financial assets prior period\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the remaining financial assets, the Group considers all relevant reasonable supporting information that is available without undue cost or effort when determining whether a SICR has occurred since initial recognition. An increase in credit risk is assessed using a transition matrix approach that determines SICR thresholds depending on the credit rating at initial recognition and residual time to maturity of the instrument. Where necessary, the quantitative assessment is supplemented by a qualitative assessment of the issuer's credit quality. For certain less material portfolios, including residential mortgage loans, the '30 days past due' criterion is used as a primary indicator of a SICR. Where a SICR is no longer observed, the instrument transitions back to stage 1.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified approach for receivables from policyholders and other receivables that are allocated to 'Stage 2' unless individually impaired. Financial assets that have become credit-impaired are allocated to stage 3 based on similar principles as are applied under IAS 39 to determine whether credit loss has been incurred.\n\nThe tables 24.4a and 24.4b show the fair value and the carrying amount (before adjusting for any impairment in case of financial assets measured at amortized cost) of financial assets whose contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are SPPI, by impairment stages:\n\n## Table 24.4a\n\nTable 24.4b\n\n| in USD millions,   as of December 31, 2022   | Stage 1    | Stage 1         | Stage 2    | Stage 2         | Stage 3    | Stage 3         | Total      | Total           |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|\n|                                              | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value |\n| Available-for-sale                           |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |\n| debt securities                              | 88,825     | 88,825          | 383        | 383             | 28         | 28              | 89,236     | 89,236          |\n| Held-to-maturity                             |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |\n| debt securities                              | 2,911      | 2,825           | -          | -               | -          | -               | 2,911      | 2,825           |\n| Mortgage loans                               | 5,071      | 5,469           | 23         | 23              | 9          | 14              | 5,103      | 5,507           |\n| Other loans  1                               | 2,700      | 2,715           | 32         | 32              | -          | -               | 2,732      | 2,747           |\n| Receivables                                  | 4,271      | 3,916           | 11,043     | 11,604          | 26         | 135             | 15,341     | 15,655          |\n| Total financial assets                       | 103,778    | 103,751         | 11,481     | 12,042          | 63         | 177             | 115,323    | 115,970         |\n\n- 1 Do not include policyholder loans, which will come under IFRS 17 and are therefore not applicable for IFRS 9, of USD 700 million and USD 635 million for fair value and carrying value, respectively.\n\n| in USD millions,  as of December 31, 2021   | Stage 1    | Stage 1         | Stage 2    | Stage 2          | Stage 3    | Stage 3         | Total      | Total            |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|\n|                                             | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying   value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying   value |\n| Available-for-sale                          |            |                 |            |                  |            |                 |            |                  |\n| debt securities                             | 127,179    | 127,179         | 418        | 418              | 26         | 26              | 127,622    | 127,622          |\n| Held-to-maturity                            |            |                 |            |                  |            |                 |            |                  |\n| debt securities                             | 2,358      | 1,897           | -          | -                | -          | -               | 2,358      | 1,897            |\n| Mortgage loans                              | 6,338      | 6,079           | 19         | 17               | 15         | 18              | 6,371      | 6,114            |\n| Other loans  1                              | 7,389      | 6,282           | 67         | 66               | -          | -               | 7,456      | 6,348            |\n| Receivables                                 | 3,195      | 3,255           | 10,150     | 10,283           | 17         | 124             | 13,362     | 13,662           |\n| Total financial assets                      | 146,458    | 144,692         | 10,654     | 10,784           | 58         | 168             | 157,170    | 155,643          |\n\n- 1 Do not include policyholder loans, which will come under IFRS 17 and are therefore not applicable for IFRS 9, of USD 794 million and USD 654 million for fair value and carrying value, respectively.\n\n## Financial assets (SPPI) by stages current period\n\n## Financial assets (SPPI) by stages prior period",

Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions, or one other party controls both. Related parties of the Group include, among others, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, key management personnel, and the post-employment benefit plans (see note 20). Transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation, and they are not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

Relationship with the Farmers Exchanges\n\nFarmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI) provide certain non-claims services to the Farmers Exchanges as their attorneys-in-fact, and also provide certain ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges. Farmers Group Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Attorney-in-fact services primarily include risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative and managerial functions. Fees for these services are primarily determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. Ancillary services primarily include information technology, brand advertising and certain distribution related services that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts for which FGI acts as a principal in arranging for those services to the Exchanges.

Another 29.25 percent was assumed by other third parties. Effective December 31, 2022, Farmers Re Co assumed an 8.50 percent quota share of which 6.75 percent was retroceded to Zurich Global, Ltd. Another 22.50 percent was assumed by other third parties.\n- 2   From January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021, Farmers Re Co assumed a 0.25 percent quota share. Another 25.75 percent was assumed by other third parties. Effective April 1, 2021, Farmers Re Co assumed a 1.0 percent quota share. Another 32.00 percent was assumed by other third parties. Effective December 31, 2021, Farmers Re Co assumed a 1.75 percent quota share. Another 29.25 percent was assumed by other third parties.\n- 3   Under the All Lines agreement, Farmers Re Co catastrophe losses are subject to a maximum percentage of net earned premiums for each year. At December 31, 2022, catastrophe losses were limited to 7.88 percent of net earned premiums, or USD 34 million. At December 31, 2021, catastrophe losses were limited to 6.75 percent of net earned premiums, or USD 13 million.\n- 4   From 2012 to 2018, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC) participated in the All Lines agreement. The insurance losses include prior-year loss development assumed by ZIC of a favorable USD 9 million and an unfavorable USD 9 million, for the years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n- 5   During 2022, Farmers Re Co incurred 26.7 percent of premiums for ceding commissions, 6.24 percent of premiums for unallocated loss adjustment expenses and 4.2 percent of premiums for other expenses. During 2021, ceding commissions were 26.7 percent of premiums, the unallocated loss adjustment expenses were 8.1 percent of premiums, and the other expenses were 5.3 percent of premiums.\n\n## c) Farmers management fees and other related revenues\n\nFarmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group, are the appointed attorneys-infact of the Farmers Exchanges, which are not owned by FGI. As the attorney-in-fact, FGI is permitted by policyholders of the Farmers Exchanges to receive a management fee of up to 20 percent (up to 25 percent in the case of the Fire Insurance Exchange) of the gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. This management fee, the primary source of revenue for FGI, has an agreed upon margin cap of 7 percent which is derived from FGI gross management result divided by the gross premium earned by the Farmers Exchanges. The expected revenues and expenses are assessed monthly to determine if expected revenues will be in excess of the cap, in which case the revenue is reduced on a pro-rata basis to ensure that no revenue is recognized for the amounts exceeding the cap. For 2021 only, FGI and the Farmers Exchanges agreed to calculate the margin cap based on results excluding Farmers Workplace Solutions (FWS). In addition, FGI revenue includes reimbursement of certain ancillary service costs incurred by FGI on behalf of primarily the Farmers Exchanges that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts. The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to FGI at cost in accordance with allocations that are subject to approval by the Farmers Exchanges Boards of Governors.\n\nFGI has historically charged a lower management fee than the amount allowed by policyholders. The range of fees has varied by line of business over time and from year to year. The gross earned premiums of the Farmers Exchanges were USD 25.8 billion and USD 23.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n| in USD millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Management fees and other related revenues         | 4,490  | 4,265  | 5%       |\n| Management fees  1                                 | 3,425  | 3,141  |          |\n| Revenues for ancillary services  2                 | 968    | 1,019  |          |\n| Membership fees                                    | 55     | 59     |          |\n| Other revenues                                     | 42     | 46     |          |\n| Management and other related expenses              | 2,777  | 2,697  | 3%       |\n| Expenses for ancillary services  2                 | 968    | 1,019  |          |\n| Management and other expenses  3                   | 1,809  | 1,678  |          |\n| Gross management result                            | 1,713  | 1,568  | 9%       |\n| Managed gross earned premium margin                | 6.6%   | 6.6%   | 0.0 pts  |\n\n- 1 Increase in 2022 fees due to FWS acquisition in April 2021 and favorable net year over year margin cap adjustment.\n- 2   Decrease in revenues and expenses for ancillary services primarily due to lower advertising and distribution related services.\n- 3   Increase in operating expenses largely due to FWS acquisition in April 2021.\n\n## Quota share reinsurance treaty\n\n## Farmers Management Services\n\n<!-- image -->",

Segment information\n\nThe Group pursues a customer-centric strategy, where the Property & Casualty (P&C) and Life businesses are managed on a regional basis. The Group's reportable segments have been identified on the basis of the businesses operated by the Group and how these are strategically managed to offer different products and services to specific customer groups. The Group has identified 13 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and segment information is presented accordingly as follows:\n\n- - Property & Casualty regions\n- - Life regions\n- - Farmers\n- - Group Functions and Operations\n- - Non-Core Businesses\n\nThe Group's reportable segments comprise the following:\n\n## Property & Casualty and Life regions\n\n- - Europe, Middle East & Africa\n- - North America\n- - Asia Pacific\n- - Latin America\n- - Group Reinsurance\n\nProperty & Casualty regions provide a variety of motor, home and commercial products and services for individuals as well as small and large businesses on both a local and global basis. Products are sold through multiple distribution channels including agents, brokers and bank distribution.\n\nLife regions provide a comprehensive range of life and health insurance products on both an individual and a group basis, including annuities, endowment and term insurance, unit-linked and investment-oriented products, as well as full private health, supplemental health and long-term care insurance. In addition to the agent distribution channel, certain of these products are offered via bank distribution channels.\n\nFarmers, through Farmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI), provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders. This segment also includes all reinsurance assumed from the Farmers Exchanges by the Group. Farmers Exchanges are prominent writers of personal and small commercial lines of business in the U.S. In addition, this segment includes the activities of Farmers Life, a writer of individual life insurance business in the U.S.\n\nGroup Functions and Operations comprise the Group's Holding and Financing, Headquarters and the new digital ventures of Zurich Global Ventures. Certain alternative investment positions not allocated to business operating segments are included within Holding and Financing. In addition, this segment includes operational technical governance activities relating to technology, underwriting, claims, actuarial and pricing.\n\nNon-Core Businesses include insurance and reinsurance businesses that the Group does not consider core to its operations and that are therefore mostly managed to achieve a beneficial run-off. Non-Core Businesses are mainly situated in the U.S., Bermuda, and in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/(losses) and impairments on investments (except for certain non-insurance operations included in Non-Core Businesses, investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss, certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes and policyholders' share of investment results for the life businesses) and non-operational foreign exchange movements. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters or large one-off regulatory projects outside the ordinary course of business, gains and losses on divestment of businesses, certain business combination integration costs and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are considered industry norms, generally applicable to insurers who operate in the same markets.\n\nFor Zurich Santander Insurance America, S.L. and its subsidiaries, and the Bansabadell insurance entities, certain protective rights exist, which, among others, include liquidation, material sale of assets, transactions affecting the legal ownership structure, dividend distribution and capital increase, distribution channel partnerships and governance, which are not quantifiable.\n\nFor details on the Group's capital restrictions, see the capital management section in the risk review, which forms an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTable 28.2 shows the summarized financial information for each subsidiary that has non-controlling interests that are material to the Group.\n\nTable 28.2\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31                      | Zurich Santander Insurance  America, S.L.  and its subsidiaries   | Zurich Santander Insurance  America, S.L.  and its subsidiaries   |       |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n|                                                         | 2022                                                              | 2021                                                              | 2022  | 2021   |\n| Non-controlling interests percentage                    | 49%                                                               | 49%                                                               | 50%   | 50%    |\n| Total Investments                                       | 16,105                                                            | 13,215                                                            | 8,508 | 10,979 |\n| Other assets                                            | 3,079                                                             | 2,858                                                             | 1,553 | 1,595  |\n| Insurance and investment contract liabilities  1        | 17,194                                                            | 14,331                                                            | 8,373 | 10,747 |\n| Other liabilities                                       | 936                                                               | 803                                                               | 388   | 426    |\n| Net assets                                              | 1,054                                                             | 940                                                               | 1,300 | 1,401  |\n| Non-controlling interests in net assets                 | 516                                                               | 461                                                               | 650   | 700    |\n| Total revenues                                          | 3,737                                                             | 2,372                                                             | 1,451 | 1,836  |\n| Net income after taxes                                  | 423                                                               | 270                                                               | 215   | 183    |\n| Other comprehensive income                              | 26                                                                | (211)                                                             | (173) | (123)  |\n| Total comprehensive income                              | 449                                                               | 59                                                                | 43    | 60     |\n| Non-controlling interests in total comprehensive income | 220                                                               | 29                                                                | 21    | 30     |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling interests             | 171                                                               | 263                                                               | 73    | 68     |\n\n- 1 Includes reserves for premium refunds, liabilities for investment contracts, deposits received under ceded reinsurance contracts, deferred front-end fees and liabilities for insurance contracts.\n\n## Non-controlling interests",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as those of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n362",

It requires the use of complex formulas and computational tools that may be incorrectly configured, and for which inaccurate or incomplete input data may be used.\n\nThis is specifically the case for Property & Casualty lines of business that are considered longer-tail such as worker's compensation, general and professional liability, and other specialty lines where certain longer-term assumptions are required as part of the projection techniques. These projection techniques also consider exposures to the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic including uncertainty around claims litigation, timeliness of claims reporting and resultant impact of challenges with supply chains and inflation.\n\nAdditionally, reserves for catastrophes events which are usually of less frequency but higher severity, are more difficult to estimate and include expert judgments, specifically for events taking place close to period end.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified this as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates of the Group about the valuation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are described in Notes 3 and 4 respectively and additional information regarding these reserves is presented in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, uncertainty triggered by the second order effects of the COVID-19 pandemic requires additional analysis and judgment.\n\nMoreover, because of the long duration of many life insurance products, relatively small changes in key assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuation of the actuarially determined life insurance assets and liabilities. Specifically, the significant increase in interest rates around the globe, and the related impact to policyholder behavior, creates specific risks for insurers to consider.\n\nThe valuation of these assets and liabilities requires the use of complex formulas and the construction of models and other computational tools that may be incorrectly designed or configured, and for which inadequate assumptions and/or incomplete or inaccurate input data may be used.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified this as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates of the Group about the valuation of the actuarially determined life insurance assets and liabilities are described in Notes 3 and 4 respectively and additional information regarding these assets and liabilities is presented respectively in Notes 11 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we have performed, among others, the following substantive audit procedures using the work of our actuarial specialists:\n\n- -We analyzed the Group's accounting policies and actuarial methodology to evaluate its compliance with IFRS 17.\n- -We assessed the analyses of contracts prepared by the Group for the purpose of the classification according to the different measurement models (either the building block approach (BBA), variable fee approach (VFA) or premium allocation approach (PAA)) and tested such analyses to the underlying contracts on a sample basis.\n- -In respect of the transition approaches (Fully retrospective, Modified retrospective or Fair Value approach) applied in the calculation of the CSM, we evaluated the Group's assessment on the availability of reasonable and supportable historic information required by the full retrospective approach and the appropriateness of simplifications, under the modified retrospective approach, or fair value approach applied.\n- -We tested input data and key parameters used in the calculation of the transition balances measured under the BBA and VFA to underlying source systems on a sample basis.\n- -We assessed the appropriateness and consistency of key assumptions used in the calculation of the transition balances measured under the BBA and VFA with those used in IFRS 4, publicly available market data, our knowledge of the products and the requirements of IFRS 17 as well as IAS 8.\n- -We tested the calculations of the IFRS 17 transition balances measured under the BBA and VFA either through review of the calculation logic within the newly implemented models, or through independent recalculations on a sample basis.\n\nBased on audit procedures performed, we did not identify any material exceptions related to the valuation of the transition balances measured under the building block and variable fee approaches of IFRS 17.

Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are identified at the segment level.\n\nManagement performs impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life (i.e., the AIF intangible) at least once annually to ensure that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount per CGU and there is no impairment in the relevant CGU.\n\nEstimation of the recoverable amount requires management to use complex models, expert judgment and is based on several complex and subjective assumptions, particularly in respect of projections of future income based on prospective business plans, perpetual growth rates, and discount rates.\n\nAccordingly, we deem the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill and attorney-in-fact contract to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates related to goodwill and attorney-in-fact contract are disclosed in Notes 3 and 4 respectively and additional information on goodwill and attorney-in-fact contract is presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe assessed and tested the design effectiveness of selected key controls within the Group's goodwill impairment testing process. These included controls over model used and centrally provided key assumptions.\n\nWe executed our procedures using the work of valuation specialists.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- -Performance of risk assessment by CGU based on multiple criteria including materiality, headroom, complexity and other risk considerations.\n- -Evaluating whether the goodwill and AIF intangible allocation to CGUs as identified by management is supportable.\n- -Assessment of the valuation methodology and models used by management to determine the goodwill and AIF recoverable amount.\n- -Assessment of key assumptions provided at the Group level, i.e. discount rates, perpetual growth rates, including consistency of key assumptions with market and industry specific reference values, and tax rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/auditreport.

        "page_content": "## Holding company (continued)\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 1. General information\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd (the Company) is a corporation domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland, and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. It was incorporated on April 26, 2000, and is the holding company of the Zurich Insurance Group (Group) with the principal activity of holding subsidiary companies. The Company does not employ staff, as employees work in a joint capacity for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC).\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation\n\nThe Company presents its financial statements in accordance with Swiss law.\n\nAll amounts in these financial statements, including the notes, are shown in Swiss franc thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified. All variances are calculated using the actual figures rather than the rounded amounts.\n\n## 3. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## a) Exchange rates\n\nUnless otherwise stated, assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than Swiss francs are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Net unrealized exchange losses are recorded in the income statements and net unrealized exchange gains are deferred until realized.\n\n## b) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are equity interests, held on a long-term basis for the purpose of the Company's business activities. Each investment in subsidiaries is valued individually and carried at its cost less adjustments for impairments.\n\n## c) Accrued income\n\nIncome is accrued for interest which is earned but not yet due for payment at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## d) Reserves for treasury shares (indirectly held via subsidiaries)\n\nReserves for treasury shares are accounted for at the acquisition costs of these shares held by the respective subsidiary.\n\n## e) Treasury shares (directly held by the Company)\n\nTreasury shares are carried at acquisition cost and presented as a deduction in the shareholders' equity.\n\n## 4. Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses for the year were CHF 17.0 million compared with CHF 32.1 million in 2021. The decrease of CHF 15.1 million is mainly driven by the fact that the Company didn't contribute in 2022 to the Z Zurich Foundation, whereas the contribution paid in 2021 was CHF 17.0 million. In addition, directors' fees of CHF 5.6 million and CHF 5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, are included in this line item. Overhead expenses increased by CHF 2.0 million to CHF 7.5 million in 2022. Furthermore, fees paid to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority of CHF 2.9 million and CHF 3.1 million are included for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n\n## 5. Financial income\n\nFinancial income for the year 2022 mainly consists of dividend income of CHF 3,206 million primarily received from the Company's subsidiary ZIC and interest income of CHF 134.3 million on the subordinated loan with ZIC. This interest income is recognized when ZIC declares its intention to pay a dividend to the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Receivables from subsidiaries\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries include intragroup balances related to the Group's internal cash pooling facility in the amount of CHF 1,652 million as of December 31, 2022. In 2021, these assets in the amount of CHF 52 million have been disclosed within Cash and cash equivalents. The increase in 2022 is mainly driven by the financing of the public share buyback program via a senior debt of CHF 1,800 million issued by ZIC (see also note 11). Further, the receipt of the dividend and interest income of CHF 3,341 million contributed to the increase, partially offset by the dividend paid out of available earnings and capital contribution reserve totaling to CHF 3,277 million as well as by the cash payment for the public share buyback program in 2022 of CHF 221 million.\n\n## 8.

Information regarding indirectly owned subsidiaries is included on pages 357 to 358 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 10. Other liabilities to third parties\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Other liabilities to third parties mainly consist of a withholding tax payable of CHF 128 million and a payable due to a bank of CHF 24 million both in connection with the public share buyback program.\n\n## 11. Interest-bearing loans from subsidiaries\n\nZIC granted a senior loan of CHF 1,800 million to the Company to fund the public share buyback program which has been launched in November 2022.\n\n## 12. Commitments and contingencies\n\nThe Company has provided unlimited guarantees in support of entities belonging to the Zurich Capital Markets group of companies. The Company has also entered into support agreements and guarantees for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries. They amounted to CHF 794 million as of December 31, 2022, and CHF 942 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease is due to a reduction of a funding agreement in the amount of GBP 50 million (CHF 56 million) with a Group company and a negative foreign exchange effect. Furthermore, the Company has issued an unlimited guarantee in favor of the Institute of London Underwriters in relation to business transferred to Zurich Insurance plc from a Group company which no longer has insurance licenses.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any event of default that would require it to satisfy any of these guarantees or to take action under a support agreement.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Share capital\n\n## a) Changes to the share capital\n\nOn April 6, 2022, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company approved an extension of the authorized share capital for another two years (from April 2022 to April 6, 2024). The extension of the authorized share capital required the corresponding extension of the validity of the combined dilution limitations for the authorized and contingent share capital (Art. 5 bis 5 and 5 ter 1d of the Articles of Association). Since April 2020, the authorized share capital (Art. 5 bis 1 of the Articles of Association) is comprised of 44,882,400 shares and the contingent share capital for Financial Instruments (Art. 5 ter 1a of the Articles of Association; term as defined in section b) below) is comprised of 29,921,600 shares. As of December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2021, the contingent share capital for Group employees (Art. 5 ter 2a of the Articles of Association) was comprised of 4,095,092 shares. During the years 2022 and 2021, no shares were issued to Group employees out of the contingent share capital.\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the Company launched a public share buyback program of up to CHF 1,800 million for cancellation purposes. The program lasts until December 29, 2023, at the latest. For further information, see the audited consolidated financial statements, note 19 on pages 312 to 314 of this Annual Report.\n\n## b) Authorized share capital (as specified in Article 5 bis of the Articles of Association)\n\nOn April 6, 2022, the AGM approved a renewal of the authorized share capital for another two years (from April 2022 to April 6, 2024). The Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to increase the share capital of the Company by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each until April 6, 2024. An increase in partial amounts is permitted. The Board of Directors would determine the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of payment, conditions for exercising subscription rights, and the commencement of entitlement to dividends.\n\nThe Board of Directors may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a banking institution or syndicate with a subsequent offer of those shares to current shareholders. The Board of Directors may allow the expiry of subscription rights which have not been exercised, or it may place these rights as well as shares, the subscription rights of which have not been exercised, at market conditions.\n\nThe Board of Directors is further authorized to restrict or exclude the subscription rights of shareholders and to allocate them to third parties, the Company or one of its Group companies, up to a maximum of 14,960,800 shares, if the shares are to be used:\n\n- - for the take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise or of participations or for investments by the Company or one of its Group companies, or the financing including re-financing of such transactions; or\n- - for the purpose of expanding the scope of shareholders in connection with the quotation of shares on foreign stock exchanges or issuance of shares on the national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the conversion of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'Financial Instruments') issued by the Company or one of its Group companies; or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of the Company or one of its Group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nUp to April 6, 2024, the total of new shares issued from (i) authorized share capital where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,960,800 new shares.\n\n## c) Contingent share capital (as specified in Article 5 ter of the Articles of Association) Financial Instruments\n\nThe share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing of up to 29,921,600 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights which are granted in connection with the issuance of Financial Instruments by the Company or one of its Group companies or by mandatory conversion of Financial Instruments issued by the Company or one of its Group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of the Company, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders. The subscription rights are excluded. The then-current owners of the Financial Instruments shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares. The conversion and/or option conditions are to be determined by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements, the remuneration report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of association, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report.

It indicates the underlying performance, after non-controlling interests, by eliminating the impact of financial market volatility and other non-operational variables. BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/(losses) and impairments on investments (except for certain noninsurance operations included in Non-Core Businesses, investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss, certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes and policyholders' share of investment results for the life businesses) and non-operational foreign exchange movements. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters or large one-off regulatory projects outside the ordinary course of business, gains and losses on divestment of businesses, certain business combination integration costs and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP. Business operating profit before interest, depreciation and amortization (BOPBIDA) excludes interest expense on debt, depreciation and impairments of property and equipment and amortization and impairments of intangible assets. BOPBIDA includes amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred origination costs and distribution agreements. Please refer to the 'consolidated financial statements, Note 27. Segment information, Table 27.4' for further information.\n\n## Business operating profit (after-tax) return on shareholders' equity (BOPAT ROE)\n\nindicates the level of BOP relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as BOP, annualized on a linear basis and adjusted for taxes, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period. The average shareholders' equity for each quarter is then added together and divided by the number of quarters. If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting within the first ten working days in April, then the dividend is deducted from the second quarter opening shareholders' equity. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/ROE, EPS and BVPS' for further information.\n\n## Cash remittances\n\nis the net extraction of capital from each of the business units (P&C, Life, Farmers and Non-Core Business) to Group Functions & Operations (GF&O) and after all central costs in GF&O. Cash remittances are typically extracted from subsidiaries by way of dividends, capital reductions, repayment of intragroup debt and reinsurance profits.\n\nR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments\n\nTotal investments in the consolidated balance sheets include Group investments and investments for unit-linked contracts. Group investments are those for which the Group bears part or all of the investment risk. They also include investments related to investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Average invested assets include investment cash, but exclude cash collateral received for securities lending. The Group manages its diversified investment portfolio to optimize benefits for both shareholders and policyholders while ensuring compliance with local regulatory and business requirements under the guidance of the Group's Asset/Liability Management and Investment Committee. Investments for unit-linked contracts include investments where the policyholder bears the investment risk, and are held for liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts and reserves for unit-linked contracts. They are managed in accordance with the investment objectives of each unit-linked fund. The investment result for unit-linked products is passed to policyholders through a charge to policyholder dividends and participation in profits.\n\n## Like-for-like\n\nis the change in the underlying metric over a period of time and after removing the impact of foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Return on shareholders' equity (ROE)\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of profit or loss relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as net income after taxes attributable to shareholders, annualized on a linear basis, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period. The average shareholders' equity for each quarter is then added together and divided by the number of quarters. If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting within the first ten working days in April, then the dividend is deducted from the second quarter opening shareholders' equity. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/ROE, EPS and BVPS' for further information.\n\n## Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM)\n\nis an internal economic capital model which defines the Z-ECM capital required to protect the Group's policyholders in order to meet all of their claims with a confidence level of 99.95 percent over a one-year time horizon. The Z-ECM ratio is defined as the ratio of the Group's available financial resources defined under the Z-ECM to the required capital under the Z-ECM model.

In particular, asset and liability cash flows are valued using risk discount rates consistent with those applied to similar cash flows in the capital markets. Options and guarantees are valued using market consistent models calibrated to observable market prices.\n\n## Insurance deposits\n\nare deposits, similar to customer account balances, not recorded as revenues. However, the fees charged on insurance deposits are recorded as revenue within gross written premiums and policy fees. These deposits arise from investment contracts and insurance contracts that are accounted for under deposit accounting. They represent the pure savings part, which is invested.\n\n## New business annual premium equivalent (APE)\n\nis a sales index that reflects the volume of life new business sales during the period. APE is calculated as the value of new annual premiums plus 10 percent of new single premiums sold in the period and is stated before the effect of non-controlling interests. Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) is calculated as the present value of new business premiums discounted at the risk-free rate, before the effect of non-controlling interests.\n\n## New business margin (NBM)\n\nis a measure that reflects the profitability of new business and is calculated as the new business value divided by APE after the effect of non-controlling interests.\n\n## New business value (NBV), after tax\n\nis a measure that reflects the value added by new business written during the period, including allowances for frictional costs, time value of options and guarantees, and the cost of non-market risk, and is valued at the point of sale. It is calculated as the present value of the projected after-tax profit from life insurance contracts sold during the period using a valuation methodology consistent with the EV principles, after the effect of non-controlling interests.",
