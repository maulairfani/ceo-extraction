        "page_content": "## READY FOR SIGNIFICANT GROWTH\n\nUPM had a record year in 2022. We had success across all our businesses, despite the extraordinary events happening in the world around us.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine permanently changed the geopolitical landscape and led to major sanctions. In the wake of the energy crisis, European countries focused on reducing their dependence on Russia. It was also a year that was marked by high inflation. This, combined with rapidly rising interest rates and continued COVID restrictions across China, had a huge impact on the global economy.\n\nAll in all, the year proved that even in very exceptional circumstances, we are able to perform excellently. I am therefore very proud of the company and of all UPMers.\n\nFor UPM, 2022 was a pivotal year. Our annual sales and earnings were at an all-time high. Our sales increased by 19%, while comparable EBIT increased 42% year on year. Our transformative growth projects also progressed as planned towards the finish line. We responded to the challenges in the operating environment with commercial and operational agility. UPM's successes in 2022 also included the historic business-specific collective labour agreements, which will increase flexibility and create new opportunities for seven businesses across Finland.\n\n## Major investments in the home stretch\n\nOur strategy is firmly up to date with current events. Global megatrends are underpinning demand for many of our products, and both our customers and consumers want to make sustainable choices. Our purpose is to create a future beyond fossils. We o/ffer renewable and recyclable materials, and low-emission energy. We also innovate and actively invest in sustainable growth.\n\nIn Uruguay, we are nearing the end of a major investment project. The Montevideo pulp terminal was inaugurated in October 2022, while construction of the Paso de los Toros pulp mill has been completed and production will start soon. The mill's cash cost level per tonne of pulp delivered will be around USD 280, making it one of the most competitive pulp mills in the world. This investment will increase our pulp production capacity by more than 50% to around 5.8 million tonnes per year.\n\nUPM Biorefining's biochemical refinery project in Leuna, Germany, is progressing well. Interest in the new biorefinery's products has been very high, as it is the world's first wood-based biochemicals plant. Detailed commercial and basic engineering studies of the potential biofuels refinery in Rotterdam continues in an intensive mode.\n\nThe Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit was in its testing phase in 2022 and is now about to enter commercial production, increasing UPM Energy's carbon-free power generation by almost 50%. This will also improve Finland's energy self-su/fficiency and provide emission-free energy for the society.\n\nSustainability will remain at the heart of our Biofore strategy. We have ambitious, science-based targets and a solid track record of concrete action to both mitigate climate change and safeguard biodiversity. We source our raw materials from sustainably managed forests and process them into climate-positive products that help our customers achieve their sustainability goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong financial position\n\nIncreasing shareholder value has been a long-standing goal of ours and we have worked systematically for years to achieve this. This work has produced results that benefit all our stakeholders and the wider society. UPM's Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 1.50 (1.30) per share for 2022, reflecting UPM's strong financial position and the Board's confidence in the company's future success. The Board has also decided on a new earnings-based dividend policy in line with our transformative growth strategy.\n\n## The foundation of our busin/e\\_s.ligas is solid and we expect a /s\\_t.ligarong p/e\\_r.ligaformance in 2023.\n\nAlthough the operating environment remains uncertain, UPM's performance in 2023 is expected to be strong. In recent years, we have demonstrated our ability to operate and deliver results in a volatile environment. The foundation of our business is solid and we are completing major investment projects that will bring us significant growth.\n\nI warmly thank all of UPM's employees, stakeholders and shareholders. Together, we made 2022 the best year ever for the company! I am proud of our recent achievements and I look to the long-term future with confidence. The world needs responsible solutions and our growth strategy meets this challenge. We are determined to continue creating a future beyond fossils!\n\n<!-- image -->",

We make good use of commercial strategies, tight cost control, materials and energy efficiency, effective capital allocation and efficient use of assets. We capture opportunities provided by our agile operating model, while capitalising on corporate synergies.\n\n## Value-enhancing growth\n\nConsumer megatrends drive the demand growth for most of our products. This is further supported by the rapidly increasing need for sustainable alternatives to fossil-based materials and energy. We grow businesses with strong long-term demand fundamentals, where we have a clear competitive advantage. This underpins attractive returns on invested capital.\n\nWe are in an intensive growth phase. Over the coming 12 months, the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill will grow UPM's pulp business by more than 50% at low costs; the OL3 nuclear power plant unit will increase UPM Energy's carbon-free electricity generation by nearly 50% at an opportune time, and the Leuna biorefinery will open a completely new growth business in biochemicals.\n\n## Responsibility is good business\n\nFor us, sustainability is an important driver for growth and competitiveness. We capture the opportunities presented by increasingly responsible consumer choices and tightening regulations for mitigating climate change and answering the plastics challenge, for example. Responsible operations and value chains help to mitigate risks.\n\n## Innovating for a future beyond fossils\n\nWe innovate new growth businesses with a unique competitive position in biochemicals, biofuels, biomedicals and speciality packaging materials, for example. The successful commercialisation and scale-up of the businesses to a significant size are important. We protect our intellectual property.\n\n## An improving business portfolio drives profitability and valuation\n\nIncreasing our share of sustainability-driven higher-margin growth businesses improves our long-term profitability and boosts the value of our shares. On average, UPM's growth businesses have more than three times higher EBIT margins than the mature graphic paper business.\n\n## Strong balance sheet\n\nOur strong balance sheet mitigates risks and enables us to implement our growth projects even during uncertain times, such as during the pandemic or the energy crisis in Europe.\n\n## Attractive dividends\n\nWe aim to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time.\n\n## 5/uniF6BAYEAR SHARE PERFORMANCE AND VALUATION MULTIPLES\n\n|                                    | 2022     | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018    |\n|------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Share price at 31 Dec, EUR         | 34.93    | 33.46  | 30.47  | 30.91  | 22.15   |\n| Comparable EPS, EUR                | 3.09     | 2.22   | 1.37   | 2.07   | 2.24    |\n| Dividend per share, EUR            | 1.50 * ) | 1.30   | 1.30   | 1.30   | 1.30    |\n| Dividend to comparable EPS, %      | 49       | 59     | 95     | 63     | 58      |\n| Effective dividend yield, %        | 4.3      | 3.9    | 4.3    | 4.2    | 5.9     |\n| P/E ratio                          | 12.2     | 13.9   | 29.0   | 15.5   | 7.9     |\n| P/BV ratio  1)                     | 1.49     | 1.65   | 1. 74  | 1.64   | 1. 21   |\n| EV/EBITDA ratio  2)                | 8.3      | 10.2   | 11 . 3 | 8.7    | 6.3     |\n| Market capitalisation, EUR million | 18,629   | 17,845 | 16,250 | 16,485 | 11, 813 |\n\n- *) 2022: Board's proposal\n- 1) P/BV ratio = Share price at 31 Dec./Equity per share\n- 2) EV/EBITDA ratio = (Market capitalisation + Net debt)/EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We want our products to create value for our stakeholders during the whole product lifecycle.\n\nWe started to implement the sustainable product design concept and worked on cases for new product development to form solid sustainability value propositions. At UPM Specialty Papers, the concept was successfully used from development to the new packaging paper launch. The new\n\nOur biochemicals refinery under construction in Leuna, Germany, will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma. We introduced UPM BioPura\u2122, renewable monoethylene glycols (bMEG) produced from carbon-neutral feedstocks.\n\nWe are in the basic engineering phase of a next-generation biofuels biorefinery. This biorefinery would produce high-quality renewable fuels,\n\nUPM's four Biofore Base research centres accelerate the development of bio-based products. The new Leuna Biofore Base in Germany works in connection with the upcoming biochemicals refinery and specialises in developing new molecular bioproducts. The centres focus on research, piloting and analytics enabling seamless collaboration with customers, value chain partners and research organisations such as universities. They work closely with UPM's mills, businesses and business-specific research centres in various countries.\n\nUPM's first forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations began operations in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay (page 41). The centre's research work is mainly focused on developing genetic materials with high productivity, optimal wood quality and tolerance to the pests and diseases that can affect plantations. The new centre contains state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment, as well as specific greenhouses and nurseries for various research and development purposes.\n\nR&D supports our growth and responsibility targets globally and enhances technology-triggered business opportunities and protects performance in existing businesses. The strong focus is on the growth businesses and close collaboration with customers and production.\n\nWe continuously develop our competences for the future needs of our businesses. Competence development is essential for the entire organisation, including both technical capabilities and ways of\n\nworking. We focused especially on our digi and data and chemistry capabilities. We also started an apprenticeship training to educate new laboratory technicians and piloting plant operators for our growing needs in these areas. In addition to internal competence development, we collaborate with universities and vocational schools to enhance mutual learning, for example through the Aalto International Talent mentoring programme.",

We are continuing our co-operation with the UN Global Compact (UNGC). In 2022, we joined the UNGC's Living Wage Think Lab. A living wage is an essential component of decent work, contributing directly to several SDG's.\n\nSince January 2022, responsibility-related measures have been included in UPM's management remuneration. The distinct responsibility measures comprise the reduction of fossil CO 2 emissions from UPM's on-site combustion and purchased energy, the achievement of a net positive impact on biodiversity in the UPM's own forests in Finland and the achievement of gender pay equity globally. These measures account for 20% of all performance measures.\n\nWe have also connected our sustainability performance to our financing. Our revolving credit facility is linked to our long-term biodiversity and climate targets, and we have issued three green bonds since 2020.\n\n## Maximising the positive impact of our forestry operations\n\nIn March 2022, we launched the UPM Forest Action programme, which will run until 2030. The global programme steers our wood sourcing operations and covers our own forests in Finland and the USA, as well as our plantations in Uruguay.\n\nThe programme goes beyond current standard requirements and takes a holistic view of the impact of forestry, combining measures that cover five key areas: climate, biodiversity, soil, water and societal contribution.\n\n## Biodiversity as a new focus area\n\nAccording to the UN, biodiversity is de-\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable raw materials and recyclable products advance the transformation to a circular bioeconomy\n- \u00b7 Our solutions respond to global challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Create value for our stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Wide set of 2030 responsibility targets\n\nteriorating worldwide, and this decline is projected to worsen unless extensive action is taken. Our operations are widely linked with biodiversity. Our forestry operations, hydropower plants and production can have negative impacts on biodiversity, which is why our approach covers a wide range of actions to mitigate possible negative impacts.\n\nWe also joined the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Program to participate in the development and testing of tools, methodology and guidance for setting science-based targets for the preservation of nature.\n\nIn 2022, we made biodiversity into a separate focus area under our 2030 responsibility targets. The new focus area will cover current and new targets and actions on enhancing biodiversity in forests, plantations, stream waters and other operating environments.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We respect international agreements, such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n- \u00b7 Our purpose, values, UPM Code of Conduct, and UPM Supplier and ThirdParty Code provide a solid foundation for decision-making, management and operations\n- \u00b7 Responsibility is managed by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team, as well as by businesses and functions\n- \u00b7 Responsible business conduct in all our operations\n\n## Implementing renewed social responsibility targets\n\nAll our activities on social responsibility are founded on the principle of respect for human rights. In 2021, we strengthened our social responsibility targets and the work to promote those continued in 2022. We carried out two company-wide reviews on our fair rewarding practices including gender pay equity and living wages and implemented pay adjustments to close identified pay gaps.\n\nBoth reviews were verified by a third party. We were also listed in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality index for 2023 for the 5th time in a row. Our community engagement focused on local activities and dialogue in Uruguay and providing aid to Ukraine under the Biofore Share and Care programme.\n\n## TOWARDS NET/uniF6BAZERO EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C in a promise to pursue science-based measures to limit global temperature rise. As a signatory of The Climate Pledge, we are also committed to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040. We act through climate-positive forestry, reducing emissions and innovating products.\n\nIn 2022, we created a global, internal guideline to manage climate claims at UPM. The guideline is complemented by practical instructions and case examples on how to address climate related issues in communications and marketing in a credible manner.

Based on the study we calculated our overall product-related impacts, including temporary carbon storage and substitution effects. The illustration above describes the situation in 2022.\n\nIn autumn 2022, we joined the pilot by the GHG Protocol to test and give feedback to the Land Sector and Removals Guidance before its finalisation. As an outcome, we already discovered valuable insights about the challenging role of biogenic carbon removals and emissions in the carbon accounting.\n\nAll these activities will contribute to our work towards UPM's net-zero emission approach.\n\nEmbedding human rights in everything we do on page 72 Examples of responsibility in different sections of the report Our Green Bond Report is available at www.upm.com/investors/ upm-as-an-investment/debt\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility",

Many of them arise from general political and economic activity and global megatrends.\n\n- Risks in the report of Board of Directors on page 132\n- Sensitivity to carbon pricing is presented on page 140\n- Main earnings sensitivities are presented on page 173\n\n## CYCLICAL AND COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM's current product offering competes in markets where there are competing alternatives for customers and where the shifts in supply and demand continuously influence prices. Changes in production capacity, supply chain shifts, new product or raw material development, and competitor and consumer behaviour may impact the price levels for our products and cause demand fluctuations. Rapid acceleration in digitalisation and e-commerce may expedite the decline in demand for graphic papers and simultaneously increase demand for sustainable packaging products.\n\nManagement: Industry-leading balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness, resource efficiency and customer offering. Responsible operations. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Growing need and consumer preference for renewable and recyclable solutions create business opportunities and drive demand growth.\n\nGEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions, soaring inflation and interest rates, energy crisis in Europe, geoeconomic rivalry between the US and China, as well as political uncertainties in several countries continue to cause uncertainty in trade policies, economic growth, rule of law and challenge competitiveness and predictability for companies with international value chains and operations in several countries. The testing relationships between businesses, governments and society, and the rapid COVID policy change in China may stress the economic and political environment and cause local challenges to our operations or influence demand or input costs for our products.\n\nManagement: Monitoring through international trade associations. Compliance. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio, geographical presence and responsible business practices may present opportunities for supply chain optimisation or strategic opportunities (incl. M&A) in an economic downturn.\n\n- UPM's cost structure is presented on page 174\n\nMain currency exposures are presented on page 205\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy can cause policy changes and shifts in market preferences, standards, and technologies, which in turn may result in changes to cost structures or the commercial opportunities of biomass and change the competitiveness of products, raw materials, industries, and countries. The physical impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions, which can increase droughts, floods and forest fires and cause uncertainties in business operations. Damage caused by insects and tree diseases can become increasingly common.\n\nManagement: Long-term targets and science-based measures to mitigate global warming through sustainable forestry, emissions reductions and innovating novel products. Enhancing biodiversity.\n\nOpportunity: Transition opportunities include those driven by resource efficiency and the development of new technologies, emission-free electricity, products and services that could bring new markets, customers, sources of funding and competitive advantage for us. Longer forest growing season in northern hemisphere.\n\n## CHANGES IN POLICIES, LEGISLATION AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe rising concern of the cost of living crisis and the strain on natural ecosystems have intensified expectations for companies to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits and complement the actions of governments. Changes in regulation, taxation or subsidies could have an effect on our performance, competitiveness and the costs and availability of raw materials. Unpredictable and rapid changes in EU policies or local legislation may occur as a response to the war in Ukraine. Environmental regulations may continue to become more stringent. As policies, legislation or stakeholder expectations, or the application of them, change, additional costs in complying with more stringent requirements may be imposed on us.\n\nManagement: Responsible operations in the value chain enhance the ability to operate and influence long-term business success, including environmental management systems, sustainable forestry and compliance.\n\nOpportunity: Creating value for society, as a company and through our renewable and responsible solutions, is an integral part of our strategy. The bioeconomy offers new opportunities for value creation and business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROJECTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invest in selective strategic projects to enable profitable growth. Investment projects are often large and may take several years to complete. They may also involve strategic, technical and operational risks. Our large pulp mill project in Uruguay consists of several subprojects. The biochemical refinery project in Germany involves new technology and opens new markets for us. The OL3 power plant project may impact energy costs or the fair value of our energy shareholdings. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures, Russia's war in Ukraine as well as bottlenecks in the global logistics and supply chains have added new challenges to large investment projects.\n\nManagement: Stringent and continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Environmental, health, safety and social impact assessments and protocols. Stakeholder engagement.\n\nOpportunity: Carefully selected and implemented growth projects improve our earnings and returns and change the positioning of the company.\n\n## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND INCREASING CYBERCRIME ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in critical information system services can cause disruptions to the continuity of operations. The information systems may be exposed to a cyber-intrusion that could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages or damage to reputation.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our measures for cybersecurity protection.\n\nOpportunity: Sophisticated IT systems enable efficient operations and optimised performance, as well as new customer services and data security.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INPUT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE MAIN RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES\n\nThe main production inputs required in the manufacturing of our products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these inputs have been volatile in recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Russia's war in Ukraine, governmental protection, geoeconomic rivalry, climate change, environmental policies and COVID-19 related governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to cause further uncertainty around the prices and availability of these inputs as well as logistics services.\n\nManagement: Continuously improving resource efficiency and supply chain optimisation and diversification. New technologies. Long-term supply contracts and relying on alternative suppliers. Selected ownership of forest land and long-term forest management contracts.\n\nOpportunity: Circular economy, continuous improvement in resource efficiency and supply resilience to withstand price fluctuations offer competitive advantage.\n\n## OPERATIONAL HAZARDS, HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur operations are exposed to risks arising from the environment, fires, natural events, machinery breakdowns, site security and occupational health and safety. A major incident at a UPM site or at a critical part of the supply chain could cause a shutdown or curtail production. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness or liability to employees, contractors or third parties.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our management, safety, security and loss prevention programmes as well as insurance protection and business continuity. Development of process safety.\n\nOpportunity: Industry-leading environmental performance provides competitive advantage. Health and safety performance strengthens engagement, efficiency and productivity.\n\nFinancial risks include foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, challenges in refinancing, counterparty or credit risks or changes in taxes. Changes to the monetary policies of major central banks may significantly impact interest rates and consequently various currencies that directly or indirectly affect UPM.

In China, pulp demand growth was solid as the COVID-19 lockdowns and containment measures continued to impact consumer spending.  In Europe, the markets remained good. However, market demand started to slow down towards the end of the year and overseas competition returned after a two-year absence.\n\nMore key figures on page 128\n\nPulp sales prices increased to record levels and peaked in the third quarter in both main markets. In the fourth quarter, pulp sales prices decreased.\n\nIn Finland, pulp operations were a/ffected by a strike between January and April and by the scheduled maintenance shutdowns at UPM Kaukas and UPM Pietarsaari in the second quarter.

In the second half of the year, the business was a/ffected by a visible slowdown in the construction industry. Demand-supply balance weakened and market prices decreased from the peak level.\n\n## Meeting future demand\n\nLong-term demand for pulp remains strong, driven by global megatrends. Global demand for pulp is expected to rise from 78 million tonnes to 108 million tonnes by 2035. Demand growth is strongest in China and the rest of Asia. The demand for pulp is being pushed up by the growing Asian middle class, increasing disposable incomes and a rise in the use of tissue and hygiene papers, paper packaging materials and specialty papers.\n\nIn the sawn timber business, the demand for sustainable and climate-smart solutions for the construction and furniture industries is driving future growth. In 2022, we launched our new customer promise 'Setting the Standard'. It reflects our aim to become the benchmark in the industry by constantly developing our practices for sustainability, product quality and customer service (right).\n\nIn 2022, construction of our new Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay progressed well in all main areas (page 40). Once fully commissioned, the new mill will put us among the world's leading eucalyptus pulp producers, serving global pulp markets with nearly 6 million tonnes of pulp.\n\nThe growth and competitiveness of our business is enabled by our strong position and sustainability across the forestry value chain in Finland and Uruguay (page 82). After the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, we suspended wood sourcing from Russia (page 83). We plan to achieve a new balance around the Baltic rim by increasing domestic sourcing and other imports while growing the share of softwood pulp in the production mix of our Finnish mills.\n\n## Making an impact\n\nAs a sustainable, renewable, recyclable and biodegradable raw material, pulp is at the core of the bioeconomy. We are actively\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCASE\n\nseeking new solutions for pulp-based packaging materials to replace plastic and to develop new uses for pulp by-products.\n\nThe global construction industry is estimated to account for nearly 40% of energy-related CO 2 emissions. Replacing non-renewable raw materials in construction with responsibly produced timber is an effective solution for emissions reduction.\n\nwww.upmpulp.com\n\n- www.upmtimber.com\n\n## UPM TIMBER'S NEW CUSTOMER PROMISE BENEFITS THE WHOLE VALUE CHAIN\n\nAs part of UPM Timber's new 'Setting the Standard' customer promise, sustainable carbon-binding raw material is turned into high-quality timber products with the lowest carbon emissions in the industry. Key elements of the promise also include long-term partner-\n\nships with customers and reliability.\n\nOur sawmills have operated using fossil-free electricity and heat since 2020. Now, we are aiming to decarbonise our internal logistics by 2025 with electrification and renewable fuels. An extensive energy efficiency programme has been implemented throughout our mills. In 2022, we also switched to recyclable packaging materials for our timber wrapping and set the goal of replacing all plastics used in packaging by 2030.\n\nOur efforts to reduce emissions also benefit our customers. The more we reduce our emissions, the smaller the customer's product carbon footprint is. We are also looking for opportunities to jointly optimise our value chain to reduce emissions - by reviewing our logistics chain, for example.\n\nwww.upmtimber.com\n\nPulp in Finland is produced in energy-efficient mills, which play an important role in the highly volatile energy markets. The steady flow of renewable electricity from the Finnish pulp mills helps to maintain the Finnish electrical system and ease energy shortages in the midst of the ongoing energy crisis (page 86).",

The new mill will grow the UPM Pulp capacity by more than 50%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROJECT IN SHORT\n\n- \u00b7 Annual production capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of eucalyptus pulp\n- \u00b7 Total investment estimate of USD 3.47 billion\n- \u00b7 Investments in pulp terminal in the port of Montevideo and local facilities in Paso de los Toros\n- \u00b7 Expected cash cost level of USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp\n- \u00b7 Competitive wood supply, best available techniques and efficient logistics\n- \u00b7 Highest safety and sustainability standards\n- \u00b7 Scheduled start-up by the end of Q1 2023\n\nOur new pulp mill will be a significant step for UPM's future earnings and shareholder value. When operational, the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill, together with forestry, wood and pulp logistics and other related activities, will create around 10,000 new permanent jobs, of which 4,000 will be directly employed by UPM and its subcontractors. The mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's gross national product by about 2%.\n\n## Sustainable plantation management\n\nOur eucalyptus plantations in Uruguay have established a new renewable raw material base for growing global fibre needs. Euca-\n\nlyptus availability for the mill is secured through plantations owned or leased by UPM, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. Our plantation areas in Uruguay cover 504,773 hectares of land owned,  leased or managed by UPM. All UPM's plantations are certified under the FSC\u2122 and PEFC certification schemes or in the process of being certified, if the site is new.\n\nyears with no effect on food production or natural forests. Our biodiversity programme has been implemented at plantations since the early 1990s, and since 2020, we have used three key indicators to measure our impact on biodiversity:\n\n- 1.  Developing the nature conservation area network\n- 3. Controlling and decreasing the invasion of exotic woody species populations in conservation areas\n- 2. Maintaining and enhancing endemic and threatened species populations in conservation areas\n\nSustainably managed plantations are highly productive, acting as a carbon sink while taking care of biodiversity. We have created permanent carbon storage for 55 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent in 30\n\n## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS IN 2022\n\n- \u00b7 The construction works at the mill site were completed in December and the project entered the final phase, focusing on the finalisation of the electrical, instrumental and automation works and commissioning\n- \u00b7 The commissioning phase will run until the start-up of the mill in Q1 2023\n- \u00b7 The pulp terminal in the port of Montevideo was completed and inaugurated, with port operations commencing in Q4 2022\n- \u00b7 At its most intensive phase, more than 7,000 people worked at the various construction sites at the same time\n- \u00b7 Work related to road infrastructure improvement in central and western Uruguay continued\n- \u00b7 Work on the Central Railway by the Uruguayan government continued; the overall rail project is expected to be finalised in Q2 2023\n- \u00b7 The state-of-the-art eucalyptus tree nursery in Sarand\u00ed del Y\u00ed began operations in Q1 2022\n- \u00b7 The first forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations in Uruguay was inaugurated in Q2 2022 (right)\n- \u00b7 Preparing commercial readiness continued in all main markets\n\nUruguay's native forests are all protected. The country is located within a temperate climate zone so there are no rain forests. The Forestry Act sets strict rules for plantation design and structure. This includes location, tree types and identifying suitable forestry soils for plantation development, as well as safe zones around roads, native forests and waterways.\n\nForestry has created important employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in rural areas. External contractors are responsible for all planting and logistics operations. UPM's forestry value chain employs some 7,000 people directly. Forestry involves a higher proportion of female workers than traditional agricultural activities - in the tree nurseries, around 50% of the workers are women. UPM has three nurseries to provide over 40 million eucalyptus seedlings for plantations per year.\n\nwww.upmpasodelostoros.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NEW FORESTRY RESEARCH CENTRE IN URUGUAY\n\nThe time-consuming work needed to breed the best seedlings to create the highest-quality trees requires considerable research and development expertise. UPM's first forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations began operations in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay in 2022. At the centre, we can enhance the applied research that we have been conducting in Uruguay for over 30 years.\n\nThe centre's research work is mainly focused on developing genetic materials with high productivity, optimal wood quality and tolerance to the pests and diseases that can affect plantations. The new centre contains state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment, as well as specific greenhouses and nurseries for various research and development purposes.\n\nAround 60 employees, including agronomists and experts in genetic improvement, health, forestry research and wood quality, work at the research centre. We have been promoting the research projects of post-graduate students in Uruguay for a number of years. With this centre, we can offer better facilities and opportunities to students and professors to develop their projects.",

Russia has tightened its grip on the natural gas pipelines, and Central Europe is considering how to replace natural gas as an energy source. The importing of Russian electricity to Finland ceased during the year. As a consequence of decreased Russian energy supply to Europe, electricity prices shot up in Europe.\n\nUPM Energy benefitted significantly from higher electricity prices and succeeded in optimising production and creating value in a volatile market.

The phased project will be fully completed during the first quarter of 2023. The plant's average annual energy production is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh.\n\n## Nuclear energy plays a key role in enabling a fossil-free society\n\nWe are responding to the growing need for carbon-dioxide free electricity as society electrifies and moves away from fossil fuels. The largest ongoing investment project is the finalisation and ramp-up of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant unit 3 by Teollisuuden Voima (TVO). The Olkiluoto 3 project was scheduled to start regular electricity\n\nproduction in 2022 but due to issues that were detected during the testing phase, regular electricity production will start in April 2023.\n\nUPM's share of the new unit's production will be approximately 500 MW generated through Pohjolan Voima's ownership. The Olkiluoto 3 will significantly increase the supply of CO 2 -free electricity in Finland.\n\n## Restoration of two rapids re-opened routes for migratory fish\n\nThere are many unnecessary migratory barriers such as defunct dams in Finland, and by removing them, biodiversity can be enhanced.\n\nIn 2022, we completed two restoration projects, Sapsokoski and Arvajankoski rapids, as part of our stream water programme. In total, the restoration of these rapids freed up over 150 kilometres of routes for migratory fish. Restoration was carried out in co-operation with stakeholders and Arvajankoski also received funding from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Nousu programme.\n\nwww.upmenergy.com\n\nCASE\n\n## OFFERING FLEXIBILITY IN TIMES OF CRISIS\n\nElectricity is a commodity that is difficult to store. Renewable wind power is only available when it is windy and solar power when it is sunny. But supply and demand of electricity need to be in balance at all times.\n\nUPM Energy is the second largest electricity producer in Finland and UPM's mills also offer flexibility in electricity consumption. We contribute to the maintenance of the electricity system. We help when there is a risk of peaking prices or even shortages: either by reducing consumption or by increasing production through hydropower plants. Nuclear energy offers the base load for a stable electricity system when wind or solar power is not available.\n\nFunctioning electricity markets are dependent on the actions of market participants. Variation in prices is the incentive for market participants to balance supply and demand in all situations. Stable markets and regulation lay the ground for future investments in electricity supply. In times of crises, the impacts of any political market interventions should be thoroughly assessed to avoid an imbalance of electricity supply and demand.",

Russia's war in Ukraine and our decision to suspend deliveries to Russia reduced our overall customer base.\n\nTowards the end of 2022 the labelling value chain experienced significant destocking especially in Europe, which decreased deliveries and impacted our result in Q4 2022. However, the demand for UPM Raflatac's end-use portfolio is relatively resilient and the long-term outlook for self-adhesive label materials remains positive.\n\nIn addition, variable cost inflation continued throughout the year and variable costs rose to historically high levels. We protected our profitability by taking firm actions to mitigate these cost increases and supply tightness.\n\n## The first label materials company beyond fossils\n\nWe continued our e/fforts to be the world's first label materials company beyond fossils. In practice, this means increasing the use of certified fibres and traceability of biobased materials, fostering reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and developing innovative products and services that help brand owners to take a positive climate action. Our ambition is to design better solutions for the packaging industry through the smart use of materials and enhanced recyclability and reuse. The recognitions received during 2022 proved that we are moving forward to reach this target.\n\nThe regulatory landscape around packaging and packaging waste continues to develop globally and will impact future product and service design and the demand for sustainable label solutions. In addition to developing our product portfolio, we continue to develop our service o/ffering like RafCycle\u2122 recycling service and Label Life lifecycle assessment. RafCycle now has over 400 partners globally.\n\nwww.upmraflatac.com\n\nUPM Raflatac is the first label manufacturer to adopt ocean bound plastics as raw materials for labels. The new Ocean Action label material is made from chemically recycled ocean bound plastic waste on a mass balance basis. This waste has been mainly collected from the coastal regions of South-East Asia.\n\nToday, only about 10% of plastic waste is recycled, and it is estimated that 80% of plastic marine litter comes from ocean bound plastic waste from areas up to 50 km inland from shores and at risk of ending up in the ocean.\n\nThrough its development work, UPM has collaborated with multiple partners in the product's value chain. Ocean Bound Plastic and ISCC PLUS certifications have been used to ensure credibility.\n\nThe label material is intended for cosmetics, home and personal care, beverages and food packaging. It has proved very interesting to brand owners who are committed to using recycled materials in their packaging. For example, the houseware producer Orthex has started using this label material in their product line, which makes use of old fishing nets and ropes.",

Market demand became softer towards the end of the year. For fine paper, demand was impacted by the COVID-19 lockdowns and containment measures in China. Fine paper sales prices increased compared to the previous year.\n\nOur global mill network and good preparation allowed us to maintain some deliveries despite the strike in Finland between\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Continue commercialisation of new barrier papers\n- \u00b7 Scaling up co-creation projects\n- \u00b7 Preparation for future growth\n\n## PERSONNEL\n\non 31 Dec.\n\n1,959\n\nMore key figures on page 129\n\nJanuary and April. In China, we managed the COVID-19 situation very well with special arrangements and were able to run our operations with minimal interruption.\n\n## New business and co-creation\n\nMegatrends support our business and healthy market demand is expected to continue.\n\nWe actively assess alternatives for future growth in specialty grades. Our recent investment in UPM Nordland Papier in Germany has already advanced our growth strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We bring new, su/s\\_t.ligaainable fibre-based packaging solutions to the market.\n\nIn addition, regulatory developments, particularly in Europe, and consumer demand are increasingly pushing for sustainable and easy-to-recycle packaging. In response to this, brand owners and the packaging value chain have set ambitious targets for recyclable packaging made of renewable materials, for which fibre-based packaging is an excellent choice.\n\nIn line with our strategy, we have been working to commercialise and co-create packaging papers that help brand owners achieve these targets. We have launched new products such as a new high-barrier packaging solution for food products with a long shelf-life (right) and heat-sealable barrier papers (page 96).\n\n## Continuous improvement in sustainability\n\nWe have been working intensively and innovatively to improve our energy e/fficiency globally and to reduce our emissions. A new combined heat and power (CHP) plant at UPM Nordland Papier in Germany and investments in electrical boilers at UPM Tervasaari and UPM J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski in Finland are good examples of how we have improved e/fficiency, whilst also securing energy availability. (page 87)\n\nIn China, our consistent track record for being a leader in sustainability was further strengthened. We were recognised as a 2022 Green Development Leading Company in Jiangsu Province for being a leader in producer responsibility and preventing pollution. The UPM Changshu mill was awarded the 2022 Suzhou Quality Award for its excellent quality management model and high-quality product performance management.\n\nwww.upmspecialtypapers.com\n\nUPM Specialty Papers, BOBST, a Swiss leader in packaging and label machinery, and Michelman, a high-barrier coatings manufacturer, have collaboratively developed a ground-breaking packaging solution for foods with a long shelf life. The longer the shelf life, the higher the demands on the packaging to protect the food from moisture and oxygen.\n\nThe end result of a BOBST-led project was a new high-barrier packaging innovation that can be recycled in established fibre recycling streams. The new solution provides an alternative to the multi-layered plastic food packaging that is difficult to recycle.\n\nUPM's paper provided a strong foundation for the development work. The paper is suitable for further processing as it is very smooth, dense and strong, while its structure enabled a lightweight and uniform coating.\n\nThe collaboration is a great example of the kind of packaging innovation the world needs right now. This new innovation enables brand owners to reduce the amount of fossil-based or non-recyclable materials and increase the use of renewable materials in their packaging.",

Still, the demand and supply balance in Europe remained tight and we were able to strengthen our position with strategic customers.\n\nWe also adopted a more agile operating model and were active in energy optimisation and consumption. We focused on adjusting supply and demand to achieve a balance that benefited paper production and UPM's climate commitment (page 86).\n\nWe continued to focus on efficiency and cost competitiveness. Between January and April, our operations were affected by the negotiations on collective labour agreements and the related strike in Finland. The first-ever business-specific collective labour agreement with the Paperworkers' Union was signed in April, enabling improvements both in productivity and competitiveness.\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Capture growth opportunities and develop product portfolio and service offering\n- \u00b7 Continue developing new concepts in sustainability and the circular bioeconomy\n- \u00b7 Continue to improve productivity\n\n## PERSONNEL\n\non 31 Dec.\n\n6,289\n\nMore key figures on page 130\n\n## Competitiveness and collaboration\n\nOur strategic focus is on safeguarding longterm competitiveness and good cash flow. In Q2, we signed an agreement to sell the UPM Steyrerm\u00fchl site to the HEINZEL GROUP. The mill has approximately 400 employees, an annual newsprint capacity of 320,000 tonnes and an annual timber capacity of 370,000 cubic metres. Newsprint production at the mill will stop at the end of 2023.\n\nTo further improve our competitiveness, we plan to optimise resource e/fficiency and reduce waste even more by making the best possible use of materials during production and after use. For example, residues from the papermaking process will be used for energy generation in our mills. In 2023, we will continue developing new concepts to increase energy flexibility and the use of byproducts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NEW PAPER GRADES FOR DIGITAL PRINTING\n\nWe are collaborating with printing machine\n\nmanufacturer Hewlett Packard to pilot a new generation of digital printing papers. The new coated paper grades are well suited for books, catalogues, direct marketing and magazines.\n\nThe digital printing market is growing rapidly, although its share of the global graphic paper market is still only 4%. The strengths of digital printing methods are cost-effective print runs at lower volumes, on-demand printing and the potential for personalised content.\n\nThe new papers benefit customers through increased production efficiency, outstanding print quality, time and cost savings, and ease of use. Lower ink consumption and waste reduction also support our customers' sustainability goals.\n\nUPM and HP formed a partnership in 2019 to bring these products to market. After intense R&D work and test runs, production has now started at the UPM Kaukas paper mill in Finland.\n\nwww.hp.com\n\n## We are a long-t/e\\_r.ligam commi/t\\_t.ligaed pap/e\\_r.liga partn/e\\_r.liga reliable and su/s\\_t.ligaainable.\n\nCollaboration with our customers on sustainability remained high on our agenda as print publications are at the core of the circular economy and fit well into customers' strategy. We also continued to strengthen our customer focus by monitoring how printing methods are evolving. In 2022, we piloted a new generation of digital printing papers as digital printing technologies are increasingly being adopted in conventional printing (on the right).\n\n## Commitment across the value chain\n\nWe contribute significantly to UPM's longterm targets to mitigate climate change\n\nand our focus is on reducing our emissions across the entire value chain. Our defined three focus areas for the climate change mitigation are: climate-positive forestry, green energy production and supporting energy transition systems.\n\nOur significant investments in a combined heat and power plant and a biomass-fired boiler at two of our German mill sites are significant steps to reduce UPM's CO 2 emissions (page 87). Our longterm wind power purchase agreement will also lead to further reduction from 2023 onwards. By tapping into a wide range of energy sources, we're helping society to move towards an energy system that reduces carbon emissions, while increasing grid stability and our business viability.\n\nWe support sustainable forestry practices through forest certification, biodiversity programmes and control over the supply chain.

Many markets, especially in the Nordic countries, are already keen to make the most of all that structural construction plywood can o/ffer.\n\n## Built on our customer promise\n\nResponsibility is an underlying part of our products and operations and is guided daily by our 'Responsibility Made Easy' customer promise. Our low carbon footprint aligns with our continuous e/fforts to o/ffer our customers clear sustainability benefits, which help them to meet their own sustainability targets.\n\nWe are constantly improving efficiency and reducing emissions from our mills and the supply chain. Our goal is to reduce emission by more than 65% by 2030 including 1% annual energy efficiency improvement of our production. The heat required in the production process is almost exclusively produced by bioenergy. The by-products of the process, such as bark and fuel chips, are used as biofuel at the mills' bio-boiler plants that generate heat the mills require.\n\nTo further improve the carbon footprint for the product range, we started to use the lignin-based WISA\u00ae BioBond bonding technology in all our WISA spruce plywood products in 2022. The technology has already been used in UPM's birch plywood since 2017.  WISA BioBond is UPM Plywood's proprietary bonding technology in which at least 50% of fossil-based phenol in the glue is replaced with lignin, wood's own natural bonding agent.\n\nwww.wisaplywood.com\n\nUPM Plywood's outstanding success in the plywood market relies on uncompromisingly meeting customer promises. Russia's war in Ukraine led to the suspension of operations at the UPM Chudovo plywood mill.\n\nThe economic sanctions imposed on Russia have closed off the European market to Russian plywood manufacturers. This has led to an unprecedented supply-demand imbalance in the birch plywood market and made meeting customer needs a challenge.\n\nWe have mitigated for the loss of production at Chudovo by increasing operation rates at our Finnish mills. This has been possible thanks to a new collective labour agreement that came in to force at the beginning of the year. We have also actively collaborated with customers to find industrial applications where spruce plywood could replace birch plywood.\n\nComprehensive and flexible customer management, and production reorganisation, have been keys to our success. We are able to deliver on both commercial and sustainability-related customer promises, even in exceptional market conditions, which is reflected in high customer loyalty and satisfaction.",

Advanced biofuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels. We also o/ffer wood-based naphtha that can be used as a low-emission biocomponent for gasoline or for replacing fossil-based raw materials in the petrochemical industry to produce multiple types of plastic. Our strategy based on proprietary technology and UPM's integrated feedstocks, supplying highly sustainable renewable fuels, is truly delivering results.\n\nUPM's operations are based on a circular bioeconomy and the raw material, crude tall oil (CTO), is a residue from pulp production. Our biofuels production does not compete with the production of food in land-use or raw materials. Our products o/ffer customers ways to replace fossil raw materials and reduce their carbon footprint. They meet the most comprehensive sustainability criteria and are awarded certifications including the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certification and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) sustainability standards. Our main markets are in Northern and Central Europe.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Established producer of renewable diesel and naphtha\n- \u00b7 Sustainable bio-based alternative to fossil feedstock in the petrochemical industry\n- \u00b7 Advanced biofuels belong to the highest sustainability class of biofuels\n\n## Market dynamics reshaped\n\nThe biofuels market remained strong in 2022, with increased tightness in Europe. Markets were supported by the supply chain impacts of Russia's war in Ukraine as well as continuous demand growth for biofuels driven by climate targets. The year was marked by a dedicated and compulsory mandate for advanced biofuels based on EU-wide rules, which became a reality and was transposed into national legislation. Market prices were at record high level.\n\nInput costs increased during 2022, as market volatility and uncertainty impacted natural gas and electricity prices. In addition, crude tall oil (CTO) markets became tighter due to increased replacement of fossil fuels, harder competition and loss of Russian volumes.\n\nIn the normal operating months, we achieved record production and profitability in the strong markets for renewable fuels. In January-May, biofuels operations were a/ffected by the negotiations on collective labour agreements and the related strike in Finland. In the second half of the year, production rates of the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery stood at very high levels.\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Continue the basic engineering of a nextgeneration biorefinery in Rotterdam\n- \u00b7 Assess the growth opportunities and new sustainable feedstocks\n\n## Focus on growth\n\nGlobal demand for biofuels is expected to grow substantially by 2030 driven by blending mandates. UPM aims to become a major European player in the production of advanced biofuels, which play an important role in UPM's Biofore strategy (page 20).\n\nThe planned biorefinery would improve the long-term competitiveness and sustainability performance of UPM Biofuels. We are studying several residue-based feedstocks and technologies for the most valuable end-uses in the transport and petrochemical sectors. The use of green hydrogen is also being studied as part of the technology concept. The planned biorefinery would enhance material e/fficiency with solutions based on the use of waste and residues without compromising global food production or biodiversity.\n\nWe are currently investigating growth opportunities in biofuels and biochemical feedstock. In January 2021, we began conducting the commercial and basic engineering study for a next generation biorefinery in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe fight climate change with advanced biofuels and bio-based raw mat/e\\_r.ligaials.\n\n## Towards climate neutrality\n\nFossil substitution plays a key role in enabling the EU's green growth and climate neutrality by 2050. UPM's biofuels facilitate the EU's targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and our biofuels belong to the most demanding sustainability category of the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII). Products eligible for this category are of premium quality and\n\ncan be classified as advanced biofuels. Our UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery, with the annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes, is the largest advanced biofuels-only biorefinery in the EU.\n\nPredictable regulation is one of the key elements that enables green growth investments. We support increased emission reduction targets in transport and the increased mandate for advanced biofuels. The EU's target to speed up the deployment of other low-emission alternative energies for transport, such as electricity, hydrogen and renewable synthetic fuels, opens interesting growth opportunities for UPM with well-fitting know-how and assets.\n\nwww.upmbiofuels.com\n\nA recent report has revealed that around 30% of fossil-derived fuels used for transportation in the EU could be replaced with advanced biofuels by 2050.\n\nGlobally, transport accounts for about a quarter of CO 2 emissions. Heavy-duty transport, shipping and aviation will soon require new solutions and will need to act rapidly. While electrification progresses, the legacy fleet of internal combustion engines will outnumber the electric fleet for a long time to come.\n\nIn terms of meeting the 55% emission reduction target of the EU climate plan, advanced biofuels offer a fast-track solution to significantly reduce emissions. UPM's planned biorefinery would help Europe meet this target and reduce dependence on non-EU energy sources.\n\nThe total annual use of biofuels in Europe is currently between 17 and 20 million tonnes. All sustainable solutions must be used to increase Europe's energy security and reduce the use fossil fuels. Geopolitical challenges make this more important than ever.",

UPM's new generation of biochemicals made from hardwood, which is sourced from sustainably managed forests, will enable brands to redefine their emission reduction, significantly reduce their Scope 3 emissions and switch out of fossil-based chemical feedstocks for good. Our innovative biochemicals will show the way for the transition of the chemicals industry towards a circular bioeconomy.\n\nThe biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and renewable functional fillers. In addition, the biorefinery will produce bio-monopropylene glycols (BioMPG) and industrial sugars.\n\nThe EUR 750 million investment at Leuna is rapidly taking shape, in anticipation for start-up by the end of 2023. The biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built, requiring precision in every detail of planning and construction.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Unique and innovative technology concept\n- \u00b7 Sustainable, certified feedstock\n- \u00b7 High quality products for plastics, textile and rubber applications, as well as industrial liquids, with a sustainability that sets us apart\n- \u00b7 Very positive brand image for many consumer products in packaging, automotive, textiles and other industrial segments\n- \u00b7 A robust, scalable business platform\n\nAfter confirming in January 2022 that the completion of the biorefinery would be delayed, we successfully navigated the challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruptions.\n\nAlong with building the facility, we are preparing the business to become fully operational. We have hired and started training the operations personnel and established reliable supply chains.\n\nConstruction at the biorefinery-site in Leuna continues with visible progress. Major overground structures have been emerging. The erection of pipe racks, casings, tanks and the substation buildings is progressing with good speed. Also, large parts of the reactors, furnaces and columns have been delivered and are stored on site.\n\nWe have also extended our feedstock sourcing network, resulting in the first deliveries of wood on site in November. This has enabled us to begin testing our wood handling and processing operations. The networks we have built with partners in the forest value chain have helped us to address the benefits of wood use in wider policy discussions.\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Site completion and gradual start-up of the biorefinery\n- \u00b7 Accelerate commercial partnerships in readiness for production\n- \u00b7 Continue to optimise the performance of the product portfolio, further reducing its carbon footprint as we strive for carbon negative\n- \u00b7 Strengthen the sourcing network for our sustainably sourced feedstock\n\n## Commercialisation on the way\n\nWe took important steps to bring our products to global markets. We presented our lignin-based Renewable Functional Filler (RFF) solutions, UPM Biomotion\u2122, at the world's biggest rubber industry trade fair (DKT IRC) in Nuremberg and further strengthened our distributor network.\n\nWe also announced commercial partnerships for UPM BioPura that will transform the carbon footprint of value chains in different industries.

We have brought together a team of experts to assess and study future ap-\n\nplications for biochemicals. We are exploring opportunities to address needs in additional chemical value chains, utilising side-stream products or based on the technological platform we are now completing.\n\nThe sustainable sourcing of biomass is a vital factor for us and our commercial partners.  The wood used to produce UPM's renewable biochemicals is 100% certified and sourced from regional beechwood forests around Leuna, conserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems. All the wood used is fully traceable and supported by a verified third-party chain of custody.\n\nA heightened focus on reduced carbon emissions means the demand for renewable materials will continue to increase. We are actively working to optimise processes and material streams to further reduce emissions, seeking carbon neutrality - or even carbon negativity - of the products produced in our biorefinery.\n\nwww.upmbiochemicals.com\n\nA world beyond fossils took a significant step forward in 2022, as we entered into commercial partnership with the South Korean company Dongsung Chemicals. Together, we are aiming to bring sustainable biochemicals to global markets.\n\nThe initial focus for Dongsung is to replace fossil-based mono-ethylene glycols, used to make shoe soles for global sports brands, with UPM BioPura TM . For manufacturers like Dongsung, a leading Asian provider of polymers for the shoe industry, UPM's woodbased biochemicals present an opportunity to advance their net zero commitments and to achieve a competitive advantage.\n\nRenewable materials in footwear are already being commercialised and demand will continue to increase further in the fashion and shoe industry. Whilst sports shoes are the first objective, UPM and Dongsung intend to extend their collaboration into other sectors, including automotive interior materials and adhesives. The rising demand of electric vehicles is driving a consumer expectation that, not only should it deliver zero emissions, but the whole vehicle should be made from environmentally sound materials.\n\nwww.idongsung.com",

In 2022, we launched a new clinical investigation for superficial dermal burns led by experienced plastic surgeons in the university hospitals of Uppsala and Link\u00f6ping in Sweden.\n\nwww.upmbiomedicals.com\n\nUPM BIOREFINING /uniF6BA UPM BIOCOMPOSITES\n\n## THE BEST IN CLASS\n\nUPM Biocomposites is creating circular economy solutions through the manufacture of innovative composite materials and decking products. The materials are based on our own R&D.\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Raise awareness of the unique UPM ProFi recycling and UPM Formi fossil substituting cases\n- \u00b7 Continue to focus on effectiveness\n- \u00b7 Grow with UPM Formi in chosen end-use areas\n- \u00b7 Gain market share with UPM ProFi best-inclass decking solutions\n- \u00b7 Continue actions to reduce our carbon footprint in business-related value chains\n\nposite decking is manufactured. The UPM ProFi Piazza product range is made with up to 75% recycled materials and o/ffers best-in-class performance. We are a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to increase the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, enabling a reduction in the carbon footprint of the end product by up to 80% when compared to\n\nsimilar products made from fossil-based materials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. Products comply with food safety standards and other similar quality requirements.\n\nBusiness growth continued in 2022 with our customers launching new products on the market, from storage boxes to design objects. Together with new and existing customers, we developed and piloted new end-use areas for the material. Commercial interest was reflected in the strong demand for almost 100% biobased UPM Formi EcoAce.\n\nwww.upmprofi.com www.upmformi.com\n\nIn life sciences , our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release living cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells.\n\nIn 2022, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the uncertainty surrounding construction, as well as continued consumer uncertainty, were reflected in UPM ProFi's sales. However, we managed to increase market shares in Central Europe, where we stand out thanks to the responsibility and recyclability of our locally produced products. The UPM ProFi Piazza product range was expanded.",

Numerous discussions were focused on forests and the current energy crisis in Europe.\n\nnew, we organised background briefings for several stakeholder groups, explaining UPM's thinking on the new way of negotiations. Representatives for the media, political parties, labour market organisations, think tanks and different corporations attended the briefings.\n\nUPM Plywood and UPM Timber signed business-specific collective labour agreements with the Industrial Union in December 2021. UPM Communication Papers, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Raflatac, UPM Pulp and UPM Biofuels reached\n\nagreements with the Paperworkers' Union on 22 April 2022, after an almost four-month strike.

We want to contribute to the discussions and offer solutions as a response to young people's growing concerns about climate change and sustainable development.\n\nThe Er\u00e4tauko dialogues provided a space for constructive dialogue on sustainable forests where young people's voices could be heard. At the Johtajatulet Leadership Seminar, Scouts engaged in a dialogue with Finland's leading decision-makers.\n\nIn the Climate Backpack project, social media influencers gathered young people's ideas on how everyone can contribute to a more sustainable future. The messages gathered during the project, including from websites and social media, were packed in a backpack which was handed over to Finland's Prime Minister in February.\n\nThe co-operation culminated in the Finnjamboree Kajo camp that took place in July in southern Finland, which attracted more than 120,000 visitors. Campers and visitors were able to learn about UPM's activities at the partner village and in recreational orienteering activities. UPM donated all the timber used in the camp.\n\n## www.scouts.fi\n\n## OUR MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOur Biofore strategy forms the foundation of our/uni00A0stakeholder dialogue. The key focus areas and/uni00A0activities vary locally and according to stake holder needs. Key stakeholders are defined on the basis of materiality: either UPM's operations have a significant impact on stakeholders or vice versa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholder mapping, active dialogue and the systematic gathering of feedback play an essential role in our stakeholder relations' work. We analyse the feedback carefully to understand the expectations of our stakeholders. Then, we take these expectations into consideration during our development work and decision-making. We received approximately 300 (400) enquiries or concerns from the general public in 2022.\n\nEvery year, we conduct a materiality analysis (page 62) that highlights the topics UPM has a significant impact on or which have a significant impact on the company. The analysis is based on internal assessments as well as interests and concerns of stakeholders.\n\n## Green recovery high on the policy agenda\n\nThrough public a/ffairs work, we aim to foster the necessary prerequisites for our op-\n\nerations, particularly in Finland, Uruguay, Germany and China. Active influencing at the EU level is also important.\n\nFor decision-makers and politicians, 2022 was challenging because of the Russia's war in Ukraine. The war has impacted especially on the supply and price of energy in Europe. Many political decisions have been taken under the context of REPowerEU and several temporary market measures have been considered. As UPM is an active energy market participant, both\n\nWe co-operate with a number of trade associations, the most important being the Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) and the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI).

For example, we collaborated closely with the Guides and Scouts of Finland (page 61). UPM does not financially support political parties or individual candidates.\n\nIn 2022, we provided aid to Ukraine through various organisations and arranged a global fundraising campaign for our employees together with the Red Cross (below).\n\nThe local sponsorships and other contributions amounted to approximately EUR 0.9 million (EUR 0.8 million) within the Biofore Share and Care programme. The figure includes support for the Uruguayan UPM Foundation, which continued with a contribution of USD 400,000 (USD 400,000). The foundation supports and encourages training, entrepreneurship, employment, healthy living and entertainment in local communities in the Uruguayan countryside.\n\nAll in all, EUR 499,800 (EUR 498,700) was donated to charities or other non-profit causes such as the Red Cross, Unicef, Ukraine Foundation, Save the Children Finland, The Children and Youth Foundation as well as the Baltic Sea Action Group.\n\ned their Ukrainian colleagues in many everyday tasks.

Globally, we continued active co-operation with local permit authorities.\n\nWe were an active international stakeholder member of the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, PEFC/02-44-41) and participated in the development of the PEFC forest certification system, reflecting our aim to promote sustainable forest management globally. In Finland, we participated in updating the forest management standards in both the FSC\u2122 (Forest Stewardship Council\u2122, FSC N003385) and the PEFC schemes.\n\n## Emphasis on local communities and impacts\n\nOur mills in Europe, China and Uruguay have the potential to be some of the biggest employers and taxpayers in the locations where they operate.

In the spring, we decided to allocate most of the annual donation funds to support Ukraine and therefore several donations were made to various charitable causes. In addition, UPM Plywood and UPM Timber delivered truckloads\n\nmill visits, and our Kymi, Kaukas and Steyrerm\u00fchl mills have their own forums for local dialogue. We also co-operate with local schools and education networks, organising events and excursions, for example. In addition, it is crucial for us to engage in active dialogue with local forest owners, neighbours of harvesting sites and other individuals involved in forest management.\n\nThe year 2022 marked the 150th anniversary of the beginning of UPM on the riverbanks in Kuusankoski, Valkeakoski, Pori and Verla in Finland. The anniversary celebrations for employees and stakeholders included visits to museum exhibitions, cultural events, seminars and publishing history books of the mills.\n\nOur EMAS (EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) statements cover societal impacts in addition to environmental performance, providing more detailed information on the local impacts of our pulp and paper mills. The EMAS statements also include information on co-operation with local stakeholders, such as sponsorship of local organisations or co-operation with educational institutions. These mill-specific statements complement UPM's corporate EMAS reporting.

The annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES) has invited all employees to evaluate different aspects of their work every year since 2007. The high participation rate of 79% (83%) indicates that UPMers are keen to improve their workplace. The average engagement score is 70 (+2). According to the EES results, one of our strengths is that our employees are able\n\nto successfully balance their work and private life.\n\nOur values lay the foundation of who we are. Building a culture of Aiming Higher is essential to our success in today's rapidly changing world. We are accountable, performance-driven, human centric and eager to learn and grow. Our aim is to increase employee motivation further.\n\n## Encouraging learning\n\nIn a changing and increasingly complex business environment, enhancing employees' capabilities and wellbeing is important for both business success and sustained employability.

In the EES, the result on the question about good opportunities to learn and grow at UPM was 64 (+2).\n\nExpert communities have an important role in sharing and learning across the company. In 2022, we ran a project to support setting up new expert communities and boost the existing ones around various topics such as market intelligence and sustainability.\n\nWe apply the 70-20-10 learning and development framework: 70% of the learning takes place on the job; 20% comes from sharing with and learning from colleagues; and 10% comes from training.\n\nWe have continuously introduced new digital learning content and online programmes. They encourage individuals to strengthen their self-leadership and resilience and support leaders in enabling their teams to perform and grow. Employees can share digital learning content flexibly on our\n\nlearning platform. We o/ffer e-learning content to develop skills in areas in commerce, finance, compliance, safety and leadership, for example.\n\n## Developing employee experience and enabling renewal\n\nDeveloping employee experience is a key aspect in developing UPM as a workplace. To strengthen our work community, we started a dialogue on our purpose and values in 2021, which we continued in 2022. All UPMers are given a chance to create a personal and team-based connection to our purpose, values and Aiming Higher mindset. Managers have been provided with support to facilitate discussions in their teams. The EES results show that our employees' excitement about UPM's future and their sense of belonging have increased.\n\nDigital work is an important part of the experience.  Over 450 UPMers participated in creating our new intranet, Gri/ffin Forum. It connects and engages employees globally. Human centricity and design thinking guided us in planning and content creation.\n\nWe have launched projects to develop future ways of working and digital capabilities, and to create global health and wellbeing concepts as part of our UPM Experience programme (right). We are committed to caring for our employees to feel physically energetic, mentally balanced, included and proud to work at UPM.\n\nWe have also continued to develop our employees' career experience. We use a design-thinking approach and enable employees to contribute to projects. Based on the targets for career experience, set in 2020, we redefined our development planning process and tools in 2022. The new practise enables employees to create their own development plans as needed, but at least once a year. Managers ensure that the plans are relevant. The aim is to support employees to keep their passion and expertise fresh for current and future jobs through continuous development.\n\nWe have organised several successful graduate programmes in recent years.

Our approach to rewarding and recognising employees consists of both tangible and intangible components. Tangible remuneration and recognition consists of base salary, benefits and incentives, which are determined by UPM's global rules, local legislation, general agreements, local market practices, the level of the position and individual performance. Gender, age, ethnic origin and nationality play no role in determining salaries and wages.\n\nEach employee belongs to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. The scheme covers group- and business-level targets, personal and team performance targets, and individual performance evaluation to di/fferentiate and reward high performance.\n\nIntangible remuneration and recognition consists of, for instance, a safe and healthy working environment, interesting and meaningful work, and good leadership and career opportunities. We have designed our reward policy to increase employee commitment to, and motivation for, high performance.\n\n## UPM's personnel by business area 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull time 97% Permanent 89%\n\nPart time\n\n## 3% Fixed term 11 %\n\nThe annual incentives paid in 2022 for the 2021 STI plan amounted to EUR 63 million, and the estimated amount of annual incentives for the 2022 plan is EUR 53 million. We recognise significant individual or team success with a separate Achievement Award system. It is designed to support UPM's high-performance culture and recognise individuals and teams for outstanding contribution, significant achievements and exceptional performance.\n\nIn addition to the Short-Term Incentive scheme, we provide two long-term incentive plans: Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees. Launched annually, the plans cover in total 477 participants.\n\n## Promoting co-operation\n\nWe are committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations.

The annual review enables the monitoring of possible gender pay gaps and to make pay adjustments respectively. In 2022, we conducted the company-wide\n\nreview and implemented the pay adjustments for unexplained gaps.\n\nThis commitment to fair rewarding is exceptional and shows our strong dedication to fair treatment of all employees on both a national and global scale.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\ntatives from business units in Europe. Our other co-operative bodies in Finland and Germany aim to promote employee participation and dialogue, both between the business areas and country-level management and between employee representatives and employees on a national level.\n\nUPM now has business-specific agreements for all its businesses in Finland. The new agreements enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the businesses and units. They also add flexibility to shift arrangements and the use of working hours. Replacing periodical pay with hourly pay and providing clearer criteria for pay will strengthen the prerequisites for success. The agreements also provide better opportunities to reward good performance with personal bonuses. The units have launched forums for developing business-specific collective labour agreements and the work will continue in 2023.\n\nAfter the Finnish Forest Industries Federation resigned from collective bargaining in 2020, the collective labour agreements have been negotiated between forest industry companies and the unions. In April 2022, UPM signed five business-specific collective labour agreements with the Paperworkers' Union after a strike that a/ffected pulp, paper, label and biofuels businesses in Finland. UPM Plywood and UPM Timber reached business-specific agreements in December 2021.\n\n## A diverse and inclusive working culture on page 68\n\n- Embedding human rights in everything we do on page 72\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WE ARE COMMITTED TO FAIR REWARDING\n\nWe want to ensure fair, equitable and competitive rewarding for all employees globally.

We respect the privacy of our employees and promote equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development.\n\nAll UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin or nationality, and we welcome the talent of people with diverse skills and backgrounds to our global team. Promoting\n\ndiversity and inclusion in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, but also a prerequisite for our business success.

We develop our ways of working to be modern and inclusive.\n\n## Three action areas\n\nOur Diversity & Inclusion initiative consists of three action areas: commitment to diversity and inclusion, creating and leading inclusive culture, and regular reviews of our data and processes.\n\nIn 2016, we signed an EU Diversity charter. Our D&I-related social responsibility targets, renewed in 2021, focus on sense of belonging and female representation in\n\nprofessional and managerial roles. We have set an ambitious target of 40% of female representation by 2030. We aim to develop our leadership capabilities with this increased diversity. Our situation varies by organisation. Therefore, each business requires its own targets and plans to increase female representation. According to our analysis, men and women have equal opportunities to progress at UPM.\n\nTo further develop inclusive leadership and culture, we started a dialogue with management teams in 2019 and continued this work across the company in 2022. Over 1,800 people participated in the dialogue. We broadened the understanding on leading diverse teams and created awareness of LGBTIQ+ diversity and inclusion in the workplace among our top leaders in 2022. We launched e-learning training on the topic for all UPMers and will set up an Employee Resource Group on LGBTIQ+ in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, we also carried out a gender pay equity review, closing the gender pay gap that cannot be explained by the factors that typically determine a person's salary and its development. We continue to monitor this development annually and make corrections if needed (page 67).\n\nInclusive behaviours are integrated into our leadership development programmes and in the UPM Code of Conduct training. In 2022, we started to measure inclusive leadership, i.e., how leaders at UPM value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RENEWED BENEFITS FOR FAMILY LEAVE IN FINLAND\n\nAt UPM, parents and legal guardians of any gender and in diverse families have an equal right to paid parental leave. UPM pays 32 days of parental leave to all employees entitled to paid parental leave under new family leave legislation. The new law does not require this, but we want to offer this benefit to our employees.\n\nA more even distribution of family leave has a positive impact on, for example, women's salaries and career development and eventually\n\ndi/fferent perspectives. This will be one development area for us.\n\nWe have a target for the sense of belonging where we compare ourselves to the top 10% of benchmark companies. Our Employee Engagement Survey (EES) also measures authenticity, i.e., feeling comfortable being oneself, and fair treatment which are important strengths for us. We continuously follow up on them.\n\n## Regular monitoring\n\nWe regularly review our diversity status and data. Our management teams conduct self-assessments that touch on diversity and inclusion. Managers and HR have dashboards with diversity data. Processes such as rewarding and recruitment are followed up on regularly.\n\nWe also regularly report progress to several external indices. We were included in the Bloomberg GEI (Gender-Equality Index) for a fifth consecutive year. The index awards the publicly traded companies that are most committed to disclosing their e/fforts to support gender equality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM is among top 10% companies on employees' sense of belonging\n\n68\n\naverage score on EES question, 12 points below benchmark of top 10% companies\n\nthe amount of pension people receive. 79% of UPM's personnel in Finland are men, and we hope that parental leave will act as a real incentive for fathers.\n\nThe new legislation aims to increase equality and flexibility in working and family life and provide fairer recognition to diverse families. Before the reform, mothers used approximately 90% of all family allowance days in Finland. In this new practise, parental leave and allowance days have been divided in half. As of now, parents' spouses or other legal guardians can also have paid parental leave.",

We also share safety observations and best practices in our business units to improve safety.\n\nWe aim to have zero accidents. Despite our continuous efforts to prevent all accidents, in 2022, we unfortunately had three fatal accidents concerning our contractors in the Paso de los Toros project in Uruguay and five serious accidents, one in Finland and in Uruguay and three in Germany. The fatal accidents were related to internal traffic at the construction site, cable pulling activity and working at heights.

The earlier it is incorporated in the process design, the lower the risk of a negative event impacting operations.\n\nOur aim is to integrate process safety in safety management across all sites and businesses as part of our 2030 sustainability targets. The new process safety standard defines the procedures and sets minimum requirements. It is about new ways of working, best practices in technical solutions and applying a systematic approach in everything we do.\n\nTraining will start in 2023 and we will also provide advanced training for those working on process safety, such as operators, maintenance people and technical inspectors.\n\nThe company's expanding biofuel and biochemicals businesses throughout these chemical industries require significantly stricter risk management. Our pulp and paper businesses will also be included in the first wave of the implementation.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\ncontractors. The corrective and preventive actions were initiated and the key learning points were shared across all businesses to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.\n\nWe recognise exemplary safety performance with company-wide awards. Forestal Oriental, the company responsible for forest operations in Uruguay, received the UPM Safety Award 2022. Forestal Oriental demonstrated a comprehensive and consistent safety performance in line with the company strategy.\n\n## Strong focus on process safety\n\nWe continued our systematic work to develop process safety. We developed a UPM-wide standard for process safety and a training concept for UPMers. Process safety risk assessments were incorporated into the investment process, and the key elements of process safety were also  integrated into loss prevention surveys that are conducted in our mills by an external partner.\n\nIn 2022, we were once again able to conduct safety audits face-to-face on sites. Annual safety audits are an integral part of our OHS management system. Cross-functional auditing provides valuable feedback about selected OHS processes and daily activities.\n\nWe held training sessions on Behavioural Science for Leadership in Safety for UPMers in various businesses. With this training, we aim to support our managers to lead safety so that it is a natural part of daily management and way of working.\n\n## Vision for health and wellbeing\n\nWe formulated a vision for UPM Health and Wellbeing in 2022. This takes a holistic perspective that is divided into four themes: body, mind, heart and soul.\n\nThe health and wellbeing pulse survey, conducted in May, showed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the past few years have been stressful for many employees, and that we should pay more attention to each other's wellbeing. To improve in these areas, we organised a Safety and Wellbeing week across UPM in 2022 with di/fferent local initiatives. During the week, we launched a wellbeing app, introduced various health and wellbeing challenges,\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTRIF below 2 for UPM workforce and including contractors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.9\n\nachieved for total injuries per one million hours worked\n\nAbsenteeism rate below 2 for UPM employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.5\n\nabsence rate achieved as % of theoretical working hours\n\nand held online events that focused on the body, mind, heart and soul.\n\nOur actions to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 are based on long-term continuous risk assessments. We addressed both local and global coordination and preventing the spread of COVID-19 remained our focus in 2022. We supported our employees' wellbeing with a variety of health and safety measures globally, including support and tools for remote working, such as an info hub on the intranet and an application for taking breaks and boosting wellbeing at work. We also o/ffer online training to build up resilience.\n\nUPM Plywood received ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety certification in 2022.

Long-term community development is supported by projects addressing the needs of local communities and funded by the UPM Foundation.\n\nIn 2022, our strong focus of community activities were in Paso de los Toros, where our new pulp mill is being built. Aspects identified as potential risks during the construction phase, such as road safety and increased social unrest due to a large number of construction workers staying in the nearby villages, were successfully managed and monitored throughout the construction phase. Our local office in the city centre has been dealing with queries and concerns from local communities and job seekers.\n\nTowards the end of the year, we placed increased focus on managing the social impacts of transitioning from the largescale construction phase to the commissioning phase, resulting in changes in the local dynamics on employment and small businesses.\n\nwww.upmpasodelostoros.com\n\nIn an era of major geopolitical instability, respect for human rights is crucial. Social inequality and working poverty are increasing globally as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic underline these societal shifts. We must not only strive to understand the impacts on people and changes in our business environment, but also use our leverage to respond to these shifts.\n\nDemonstrating progress transparently and building internal capabilities are vital in our work preventing and addressing human rights-related risks. In 2022, we renewed our Code of Conduct with a stronger emphasis on people. Our Code re-enforces our commitment to respecting\n\nhuman rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles. The mandatory Code training includes several concrete cases on how to act in various di/fficult situations.\n\nWe participate actively as a member in several collaborative forums such as the Human Rights Business Learning Programme by Shift, Together for Sustainability (TfS) and UN Global Compact. In 2022, we became a member of the UN Global Compact Think Lab on living wages and contributed to a TfS academy course on human rights.\n\nWe recognise the critical role of living wages and decent work in promoting respect for human rights and tackling inequality. As an example, our social responsibility targets, renewed in 2021, are set to ensure that living wages and gender pay equity underline our commitment to foster fair and equitable rewarding for our people (page 67).  We encourage our suppliers and business partners to uphold similar standards.\n\n## Living wag/e\\_s.liga and decent work promote r/e\\_s.ligapect for human rights.\n\n## Focus on salient issues\n\nIn collaboration with an external expert, we have identified our salient human rights at corporate level, i.e., rights that stand out as being most at risk. In 2022, our work focused on salient issues such as occupational health and safety (OHS), decent work and working conditions as well as modern slavery risks.\n\nIn 2022, we initiated a review process for our salient issues to catch up with the developments in our business landscape and operational environments and to identify any gaps in our mitigation activities. We expect to complete our work in 2023.\n\n## Identifying actual and potential impacts\n\nHuman rights due diligence is a necessity for businesses to identify and manage potential and actual impacts. Our business areas regularly identify these risks and impacts and prioritise focus areas accordingly. This\n\npractise is integrated into their unit-specific management systems to ensure continuity.\n\nWe monitor and work to remediate adverse impacts on human rights that we become aware of and that our activities have contributed to or caused. Remediation is specified case-by-case based on verified impacts.\n\nWith this practice we aim to ensure that we identify topics that are specific to one country or unit only and identify changes in our operating environment that may impact people, particularly those in most vulnerable positions. Migrant workers, women, young workers as well as temporary and contractor workers have been identified as groups with a higher risk of potentially experiencing adverse impacts across our value chain. As a result of our 2022 assessments, we selected contractor management as one of our focus areas going forward covering all our business areas.\n\n## Promoting decent work for contractors\n\nEvery person who works in our supply chain should be treated fairly. In 2022, our work in our supply chain focused on identifying high risk suppliers, highlighting topics such as fair terms and conditions of work, forced labour and modern slavery, environmental impacts and land use.\n\nIn 2022, we initiated a project to strengthen our approach to human rights due diligence and social and environmental impacts assessments required for investment and business development projects. The aim is to ensure that these impacts are comprehensively assessed for all relevant projects. In 2023, we will focus on developing our approach to contractor management. We will increase our internal capabilities to identify and mitigate any human rights-related risks in identified high-risk areas. Developing our responsibility reporting on contractors and contractor employees is an integral part of our development work.\n\nOverall, contractors perform a significant proportion of our activities, for example in maintenance at our production units and in construction work and forestry operations. Promoting decent work and preventing any form of labour exploitation involving our contractors is particularly relevant in our strategic investment projects.\n\n- 2030 responsibility targets on page 30\n\nCommitted to compliance on page 74 Ensuring responsible supply chain on page 78",

The compliance system is embedded in our governance model and is designed to bolster company performance and a culture of integrity at all levels. We follow how this culture is developing with the help of our annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES). In the EES, the average score about how ethically people at UPM behave was 74 (74), when the external benchmark was 78 (78).\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nWith the support of our compliance team, each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying and managing compliance risks related to its own operations.

Our monitoring activities are based on a group company risk matrix that considers the country risk and complexity and the extent of our operations in each country.\n\nThe reviews to be performed each year are agreed with the businesses during the annual risk assessment process and coordinated with the Internal Audit. The most important compliance review findings and recommendations are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses. These recommendations are then carried out in collaboration with said businesses.\n\nOur compliance team has a three-year monitoring plan for its unit-specific compliance reviews that are based on this matrix. On top of these general reviews covering all business integrity topics, we conduct riskbased reviews around specific topics such as competition law or anti-corruption.\n\nIn 2022, the compliance team conducted compliance reviews in 16 local units or operations in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic some reviews were still conducted remotely. Another example of our compliance team's monitoring activity is the counterparty screening procedures shown in the illustration on the right.\n\n- The reports related to concerns both at UPM and suppliers.

We do not tolerate retaliation against any person who, in good faith, reports suspected misconduct or participates in an investigation to resolve suspected misconduct.\n\nIn 2022, we published our second internal Integrity Report, the purpose of which\n\n## ALLEGED MISCONDUCT CASES\n\n| UPM Code of Conduct section                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Our commitment on integrity                                | 5      | 1      |\n| Our people and operations                                  |        |        |\n| Respect people and human rights                            | 25     | 19     |\n| Taking care of the environmental impact and product safety | 4      | 2      |\n| Business integrity                                         |        |        |\n| Zero-tolerance for corruption and bribery                  | 2      | 0      |\n| Avoid conflicts of interest                                | 4      | 8      |\n| Compliance with competition laws                           | 0      | 5      |\n| Protect assets and information                             | 8      | 23     |\n| Our stakeholders                                           |        |        |\n| Know with whom you trade                                   | 6      | 8      |\n| Total                                                      | 54     | 66     |\n\nis to communicate to our employees examples of cases of misconduct and how they have been handled within the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCASE\n\n## GROW YOUR OWN TREE\n\nWe update our Code of Conduct every three years to keep it aligned with the fast-changing world. When the Code is renewed, we also provide new mandatory training. The 2022 edition of the e-learning module focused on how we can apply the Code in our everyday work and how our choices impact others, in addition to the main principles of the Code. As with the Code of Conduct document update, one of the key themes in the training was promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe e-learning training was launched in September with two versions, both in 18 languages, to better target and reflect real life scenarios, one for salaried employees and another for shop floor employees. The idea behind the e-learning training was for participants to grow their own tree with their choices.\n\nFor the second time, we also launched special training materials aimed at UPM managers. Supervisors received information on what is expected of them as well as support in embedding the culture of integrity in their teams. The manager e-learning, available in six languages, has been completed by 88% of all UPM managers so far. It has been welcomed very positively, as 95% of the respondents feel that the training strengthens their engagement to our culture of integrity.\n\nwww.upm.com/compliance\n\nThe table below summarises the number of cases recorded in our misconduct case management system in 2022 and provides examples of cases handled.  Eight cases led to disciplinary action, including warnings and terminations of employment.

We buy products, materials and services from about 20,000 B2B suppliers globally. Our sourcing network includes suppliers from start-up companies to international corporations. We also buy wood from some 16,000 private forest owners.\n\nSuppliers also play a significant role in UPM's transformation and business-specific growth projects. Supplier management, together with the required competencies and digitalisation, boost product development and the commercialisation of new products in the long term.\n\nThe main sourcing categories are fibre, chemicals, other raw materials, indirect purchases, logistics and energy. When selecting suppliers, our most important criteria include reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, suppliers' financial stability, social and environmental responsibility, product safety and the product's carbon footprint.\n\n## Circumstances remain exceptional\n\nIn 2022, our focus was on securing the availability of services and products in the highly uncertain and volatile business environment, impacted by high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates.\n\nThe global economy faced restrictions due to the availability of raw materials and cost increases in many supply chains that have been under increasing pressure since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we were able to successfully protect our business continuity despite the tight global logistics and supply chains.\n\n## Reducing CO 2 emissions in the value chain\n\nA significant part of UPM's carbon footprint is created in the value chain, where our most significant emissions sources are purchased goods and services and logistics. We focus on reducing emissions from selected raw materials such as chemical pulp, pigments, chemicals and paper as well as from logistics. In the future, climate impacts will become an important factor when selecting suppliers.\n\nOur goal is to reduce the CO 2 emissions in the value chain by 30% from 2018 levels by 2030. We started a group-wide -30 by 30 programme to manage supply chain emissions in 2022 (page 89). We aim to reach this goal in close co-operation with our partners and suppliers.\n\n## What we expect from our suppliers\n\nWe are committed to responsible sourcing practices, as per our Code of Conduct. The minimum requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code. We expect suppliers to promote the same requirements in their own supply chains. In 2022, 88% (86%) of our total spend was with suppliers who are committed to the Code.\n\nIn addition to the UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code, we apply various additional requirements to wood, chemicals, pulp, packaging materials and logistics. The requirements refer to environmental performance, social responsibility and reporting. Contractors working at our production sites must comply with UPM's safety requirements.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Providing more sustainable choices to customers and consumers\n- \u00b7 Securing the resiliency of our supply chain\n- \u00b7 Enhancing positive brand perception for both UPM and our customers\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We are a trustworthy and future-oriented partner\n- \u00b7 We ensure the efficiency, compliance and responsibility of the supply chain\n- \u00b7 We create long-term business opportunities in the value chain in collaboration with our partners\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Focus on long-term, co-operative supplier relationships and promoting responsible practices\n- \u00b7 Clear requirements and expectations for our suppliers\n- \u00b7 Continuous monitoring and development of our suppliers' performance\n- \u00b7 Process development with key suppliers\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\n## UPM'S FIVE LARGEST SUPPLIERS 2022\n\n- 1.

As a member, we have access to a wider pool of EcoVadis assessments and TfS audit reports. In 2022, we conducted around 520 (340) environmental and social risk assessments with EcoVadis.\n\n## Safety first on page 70\n\n- Embedding human rights in everything we do on page 72\n- Committed to compliance on page 74\n- Climate-positive forestry on page 82\n- Taking climate action with energy on page 86\n- Advancing a circular bioeconomy on page 92\n- Sustainable product lifecycle on page 96\n- www.upm.com/about-us/for-suppliers\n\n## Spend covered by UPM Supplier Code %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n80% of total supplier spend covered by UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code (continuous)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n88%\n\nachieved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM's external purchasing spend 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strict requirements for wood-based materials\n\nAll the wood we use is legally logged and comes from sustainably managed forests. We don't use wood harvested from tropical rainforests or accept wood from plantations that have been established by converting natural forests. We don't accept wood from regions that do not respect the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nOur wood, pulp and recovered paper suppliers are continuously evaluated in regard to environmental issues, social responsibility and their involvement in the local community. These raw materials are either FSC\u2122 (N003385) and PEFC (PEFC/02-44-41) certified or comply with the FSC Controlled Wood standard or Due Diligence requirements for PEFC.\n\nIn addition to third-party certification, we also verify that the wood supplied to our mills is compliant with the EU Timber Regulation, the US Lacey Act and other regional requirements.\n\nWe source all wood assortments to ensure optimal utilisation of this valuable raw material. In 2022, we purchased 19.8 (26.0) million cubic metres of wood worldwide. After the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, we suspended the purchasing of wood in Russia (page 83).\n\nWe are also one of the world's leading users of recovered paper for the production of graphic paper. In 2022, we used approximately 1.4 (1.7) million tonnes of recovered paper. Recycled fibre accounted for 24% (22%) of all fibre raw materials used in our paper production. We buy approximately 1.7 million tonnes of pulp from external suppliers annually.\n\n## Identification and evaluation of supplier risks\n\nWe identify our supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. Collecting and analysing data on the environmental and social responsibility of our key suppliers is an integral part of our supplier risk and performance evaluation. We create development plans together with our suppliers based on these analyses. We also monitor the performance of our other raw material suppliers through various surveys.\n\nWith the counterparty risk management tool, we can evaluate counterparty-related\n\nrisks through automated screening and support businesses in ethical and prudent decision-making. E/ffective third-party management plays an essential role in securing business continuity and compliance.\n\nIf any non-conformities are identified, the supplier is required to take corrective measures. We monitor the implementation of these measures and provide support for improving the suppliers' operations if needed. However, some contracts may have to be discontinued due to insu/fficient measures or the seriousness of UPM's findings.\n\nWith regard to responsibility risks, we have implemented a new high sustainability risk supplier model in 2022. The evaluation is based on the country of origin, sourced material or service and the UPM supply chain ESG risk register. The register is updated annually and holds UPM's view on company and business area relevant risks on people and environment. We apply the model to our suppliers regardless of the business unit, country of operation or supplier spend. We also use EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans to carry out more detailed evaluations of suppliers' activities.\n\nIn 2022, we started to renew our Responsible Sourcing Framework with the aim of improving supply chain resilience and risk management. The corresponding trainings will begin in 2023.\n\n## Extensive supplier audits\n\nSupplier audits are one of the most comprehensive tools to evaluate a supplier's performance, manage supplier risk and guarantee responsible operations in our supply chain.\n\nWe identified approximately 300 responsibility-related findings in our audits in 2022. None of the findings were critical. The findings are followed-up with corrective action plans and further audits in close collaboration with our suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, our own trained auditors and external auditors carried out 121 (124) audits in Europe, Asia and the Americas, based on identified risks that covered human rights, social and environmental matters. We also carried out 360 (300) contractor reviews with a focus on working conditions. In 2022, we updated our supplier assessment criteria and the supplier audit questionnaire.\n\nWe continue to collaborate with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry",

        "page_content": "## CREATING VALUE FOR PEOPLE AND SOCIETY\n\n## CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY THROUGH TAXES\n\nThe winds of change are blowing through the global principles of taxation.\n\nThroughout 2022, the OECD, the G20 forum and the European Union (EU) continued to introduce and develop solutions to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation and globalisation of economies. These solutions are aiming for a minimum level of taxation of companies in the countries where they operate (the OECD's Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution), as well as standardised public tax reporting by companies (the EU's public country-by-country reporting).\n\nWe have implemented our transparent and responsible Tax Strategy for several years. Therefore, we welcome any initiatives for more standardised global tax reporting by corporations, as well as those for fair and responsible tax payments in the countries where corporations operate. We continue to monitor these developments in the global principles of taxation and to assess the impact to UPM. We will modify our tax reporting accordingly as soon as the final definitions are available.\n\n## Corporate income taxes vary by country\n\nDespite the turbulent year, we improved our financial performance in 2022, which is also reflected in the tax revenues generated in various countries. In 2022, UPM's effective tax rate was 19.9% (15.5%) and its cash tax rate was 16.2% (17.8%). The corporate income tax reported in 2022 was EUR 388 million (EUR 240 million) and the corporate income tax paid in 2022 was EUR 315 million (EUR 276 million). In addition to taxes on income, our various production inputs and outputs are also subject to taxation, which is either paid by us (e.g. energy tax or property tax such as taxes on real estate) or collected by us (e.g.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Taxes contribute to society on a local, regional and national level\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We are strongly committed to continuously improving our economic and social performance\n- \u00b7 Our good financial performance generates higher tax revenues\n- \u00b7 Our businesses also play a leading role in contributing to societal development in the surrounding communities through the tax revenue we generate\n\nVAT, payroll tax and social security contributions). We paid real estate and similar taxes in various countries to the sum of EUR 35 million (EUR 30 million).\n\nIn Finland, we have significant production operations across our six business areas, as well as research and development operations. As a result, UPM is one of the major taxpayers in Finland. UPM's corporate income tax in Finland in 2022 is estimated to be EUR 247 million (EUR 234 million), with subsidiaries reporting and paying approximately EUR 175 million (EUR 121 million). The remaining figure\n\nThe table on the right displays the corporate income tax and property tax paid in our main countries of operation. Based on our corporate and operational structure, UPM mainly reports and pays its corporate income tax in countries where production and innovating activity takes place.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Based on the standards of the UPM Code of Conduct, the UPM Tax Strategy describes the main principles and guidelines for our taxation\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid in accordance with local tax laws and regulations that apply to the country in question\n- \u00b7 We pay corporate income taxes in the countries where added value is created and profit is generated\n\nof approximately EUR 71 million (EUR 113 million) will be reported and paid by the UPM-Kymmene Corporation.\n\nIn China, as a fine paper producer, UPM qualifies as a high-tech enterprise with a reduced corporate income tax rate of 15%. UPM also pays withholding tax on dividends in China.\n\nIn Uruguay, the government has granted several free-trade zone permits for domestic and foreign investments. The Uruguay government has granted our pulp mill a permit to operate in a free-trade zone and therefore taxes in Uruguay mainly consist of property tax and annual tax-like charges paid to the Uruguay government for the development of the zone. The new pulp mill in Uruguay will also be located in a similar free-trade zone.\n\nIn countries where our companies are using tax losses from previous years to o/ffset the tax liability of the year in question,\n\ncountries in which we have production facilities, such as Finland and Germany, o/ffer such tax relief because the level of energy taxation has increased significantly in recent years.\n\n## Our tax governance and tax compliance\n\nThe Board of Directors' Audit Committee is responsible for the supervision of tax risk management as part of our risk management processes. UPM's internal control and risk management operations review tax risks regularly and update the control framework together with the tax function. A more thorough review of the tax practices of customers and suppliers is part of our counterparty risk management processes.\n\nWe aim to co-operate transparently and proactively with tax authorities. We also value dialogue with other important stakeholders concerning taxation. In Finland, UPM co-operates with the Finnish Tax Administration.\n\nThe UPM Tax Strategy is supported by internal instructions, internal controls and the benchmark analyses of best practice. Tax matters are managed by our tax function, which is complemented by third-party tax services to comply with local tax reporting and filing, as well as other requirements.\n\n## CORPORATE INCOME TAXES PAID AND PROPERTY TAXES BY COUNTRY\n\n| EURm           |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Finland        |    289 |    225 |\n| Germany        |    -10 |     20 |\n| Uruguay        |     18 |     15 |\n| China          |     11 |     24 |\n| United States  |     27 |      8 |\n| United Kingdom |      4 |      3 |\n| Austria        |      1 |      0 |\n| Russia         |      1 |      4 |\n| Poland         |      2 |      2 |\n| Estonia        |      1 |      1 |\n| France         |      2 |      2 |\n| Other          |      3 |      2 |\n| Group total    |    349 |    306 |\n\nsuch as Germany, limited corporate income tax is paid.\n\nFurthermore, our sites contribute to local employment, income tax and purchasing power, as well as engaging in projects with communities. Information can be found in the pulp and paper mills' third-party verified EMAS reports on environmental and societal responsibility.\n\nIn accordance with UPM's Tax Strategy, the locations of our companies are driven by commercial rationale and business reasoning. We do not transfer any value created or have any investments in production or service operations in jurisdictions defined by the Council of the European Union as non-co-operative jurisdictions for tax purposes, or in any similar secrecy jurisdictions. A list of UPM subsidiaries and joint operations, as well as their country of incorporation, can be found on page 214.\n\n## Energy taxation at various levels of the value chain\n\nIn addition to future changes to global income taxation as described above, the European Commission also aims to reform the current taxation of energy products and electricity as part of the European Green Deal development programme and its Fit for 55 climate package. The energy sector has also been impacted by the temporary\n\nmeasures introduced in the EU in response to the developments in the energy market over the year.\n\nElectricity produced by us is subject to electricity taxation, regardless of which sources are used. The majority of our electricity production is CO 2 free hydropower and nuclear power.\n\nEnergy taxation is relevant to us not only as a significant electricity producer but also in our manufacturing processes and the taxation of end products, as well as taxation at various levels of the supply chain.\n\nAlso, our renewable products (UPM BioVerno diesel and naphtha produced from a residue of pulp production) are subject to the energy taxation charged by fuel distributors to their customers. However, the energy tax rates for transport fuels from renewable and sustainable sources, like UPM BioVerno, are lower than those from fossil fuels.\n\nWithin the EU, energy taxation laws allow member states to compensate for the taxes paid on, or apply lower tax rates to, industrial production. Many of the main\n\nMost of the energy used in our production processes is subject to energy tax, although there are various tax rates and exemptions depending on the type of use. We also pay a significant amount of energy tax on fuels for logistics costs, especially for road transportation.\n\n## DIRECT ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED BY UPM IN 2022 (EUR MILLION)\n\n| Direct economic value created     |            | Economic value distributed                       |         |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                   |            | Operating costs                                  | -8,289  |\n| Sales                             | 11 , 7 2 0 | Employee wages and benefits                      | -1,181  |\n| Income from sale of assets        | 76         | Payments to providers of loans                   | -95     |\n| Income from financial investments | 11         | Dividend distribution                            | -693    |\n| Other income                      | 194        | Corporate income taxes paid   and property taxes | -349    |\n| Total                             | 12,001     |                                                  | -10,607 |\n\nEconomic value retained 1,394\n\nUPM's economic impact is significant in the surrounding communities.

In Uruguay, we have about 305,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and conservation areas, and in the USA 76,000 hectares of forest. We also lease about 167,000 hectares in Uruguay and manage about 1.4 million hectares of private forests in Finland and 33,000 hectares in Uruguay. We apply the same strict sustainability standards everywhere we operate.\n\nOf our four modern nurseries, three are in Uruguay and one in Finland. In 2022, our newest nursery in central Uruguay began operating to ensure su/fficient wood supply for the new Paso de los Toros pulp mill.\n\nAbout 165,000 hectares (18%) of the land we own globally is protected. Protected areas include valuable habitats, natural forests, and other areas of high value.\n\nHigh-quality seedlings will ensure good growing conditions for the forests and are important not only for wood raw material production but also for carbon sequestration, restoration of biodiversity and increasing resilience to climate change.\n\nFor example, in Finland, nurseries are producing hardwood seedlings, which enable the restoration of vibrant mixed forests, in turn helping to support enhanced biodiversity and climate adaptation. In Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay, we opened our first Forestry Research Centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations (page 41).\n\n## Forest Action: the global forest responsibility programme\n\nIn 2022, we launched our new global forest responsibility programme. The Forest\n\nAction programme encompasses responsibility actions under five primary pillars: climate, biodiversity, water, soil, and social contribution.\n\nIn Uruguay, an institutional network has studied and monitored water usage of eucalyptus plantations for decades. Planted eucalyptus species are very e/fficient in terms of biomass production per water unit usage. Tree plantations reduce rapid run-o/ff through the soil surface thus minimising soil erosion.\n\nAs an example, we use many solutions for managing the impact of forestry on water resources. Our main harvesting approach is to leave untouched bu/ffer zones along water courses and aquatic habitats. Healthy forests are an essential asset to clean water throughout a country. Our forest inventory system is updated annually on the location of important habitats and waterbodies in relation to timber harvesting activities.\n\nIn Finland, we are one of the funding partners in a national two-year restoration project related to small inland waters including springs, ponds or streams in 2022-2023. In the USA, the forest lands are considered a crucial conservation tool in protecting the iconic Mississippi River which serves as an essential water supply to millions of people in Minnesota where our forests are located.\n\n## Forests and climate\n\nWe are committed to climate-positive forestry and improving biodiversity. Forests and forest diversity are critical for mitigating the e/ffects of climate change. We ensure that our forests continue to act as carbon sinks, remain resilient and diverse in changing climate conditions, and grow well for future generations.\n\nmental stakeholder forums. In Finland, we took part in biodiversity roundtables coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. We also continued our active co-operation with the international FSC and PEFC to promote sustainable forest management globally.\n\n- Enhancing biodiversity on page 84\n- Ensuring a responsible supply chain on page 78\n- Sustainable product lifecycle on page 96\n- Forest Action report on www.upm.com/ responsibility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INCREASED WOOD PROCUREMENT IN THE BALTIC RIM\n\nAfter the start of the Russian war in Ukraine, we suspended the purchasing of wood from Russia. The major forest certification bodies FSC\u2122 and PEFC have also excluded wood originating from Russia and Belarus from their certification systems.\n\nApproximately 10% of the wood used by UPM in Finland came from Russia, and birch was the most important imported species of wood. Wood imports from Russia have now been replaced with increased wood procurement in Finland and increasing imports from the Baltic rim and Sweden.\n\nFinland is UPM's main market for wood procurement. Thanks to sustainable forest management, Finland's forests grow significantly more than they are used. Although logging levels are increasing, they remain below the annual forest growth levels. We have also increased the share of softwood pulp in the production mix. For example, the UPM Kaukas pulp mill has switched to softwood pulp production only.\n\nDespite changes to wood procurement areas, we know the origin of the wood, and certification and actions that improve biodiversity play a key role in that. We have also increased the number of purchasing personnel and opened new forest service offices as well as increased resources in logging and logistics. In addition to onboarding new personnel, we have trained entrepreneurs in quality management and the ways of working at UPM.\n\nFor our forests to remain carbon sinks, the growth needs to exceed harvests. The annual carbon sink from owned forests in Finland and in the US and owned and leased plantations in Uruguay has averaged 2.3 (3.8) million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent over the past five years. The main reason for the decrease was the development of calculation methodologies both in Finland for soil and Uruguay for trees. Our aim is to constantly improve our understanding of carbon. In 2022 we initiated a project with the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) to improve soil carbon models for Uruguay with actual measurements on the ground. The project's goal is to gather detailed information on the local conditions and enhance the science-based approach of soil carbon modelling. We expect to have an improved model in use for our 2023 carbon calculations.\n\n## Third-party-verified supply chain\n\nWe always know the origin of our wood. We do not use wood from illegal sources or from areas where high conservation value forests could be under threat. Our wood procurement does not cause land-use change or deforestation as is evidenced by the fact that forest cover is stable or increasing in all wood sourcing areas. We do\n\n## Certified fibre share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100% certified fibre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n86%\n\nachieved\n\nnot use genetically modified trees. Compliance with these requirements is verified by an independent third party.\n\nCDP has recognised UPM as a Forest A List company for its significant actions to mitigate climate change and prevent deforestation every year since 2016.\n\nAll UPM-owned forests are certified or in the process of being certified if the site is new. We also promote forest certification for private forest owners and other customers. We have established FSC group certification schemes in Finland and in Uruguay, which support small forest owners' access to certification. In 2022, the forest area covered by UPM's FSC group covered approximately 540,000 hectares in Finland and over 13,000 hectares in Uruguay.\n\n## Co-operation with stakeholders\n\nWe have a long history of working with researchers, academic institutions, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to develop sustainable forest management.\n\nIn the USA, we initiated stakeholder co-operation with local indigenous peoples' communities to learn more about their approach to forest management and aim to increase this type of work in the future. In Uruguay, we collaborated with stakeholders and NGOs such as Vida Silvestre Uruguay to professionally manage conservation areas. We participated in forest and environ-\n\nIn 2022, we continued our long-term co-operation with the Osprey Foundation in Finland by launching a bird protection project for 8,000 hectares on UPM land. As part of this project, active measures were put in place to encourage three endangered predatory species to nest in commercial forests using species inventories and artificial nests will also be built.\n\n## UPM FORESTS AND PLANTATIONS\n\n|                                                                  | 2008   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Forest and plantation land,  own and leased (1,000 ha)           | 1, 012 | 1, 070 |\n| Forest growth (million m 3 )                                     | 4.3    | 6.7    |\n| Wood harvested from UPM  forests and plantations  (million m 3 ) | 2.2    | 4.5    |\n| Value of forests and planta- tions, including land (EURm)        | 1,270  | 3,421  |",

According to the UN, and despite ongoing e/fforts, biodiversity is deteriorating worldwide. This decline is projected to worsen if no action is taken. Mitigating climate change is the single most important action to improve biodiversity.\n\nRivers have been dammed, which has a/ffected the flows and changed the living conditions of migrating fish and other river-dwelling fauna.

Biodiversity is instrumental in maintaining healthy forest growth and ensuring that forests adapt to the changing climate. Biodiversity also plays an important role in ensuring the sustainability of our energy business and in particular of our hydropower plants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MORE SPAWNING AREAS AND WATERWAYS FOR MIGRATORY FISH\n\nThere are many unnecessary migratory barriers such as defunct dams in Finland, and by removing them, biodiversity can be restored. In 2022, we restored the Sapsokoski and Arvajankoski rapids as part of our stream water programme.\n\nThe restoration of the Sapsokoski rapids in north-eastern Finland provided a better spawning habitat for trout. We returned the stones we had removed from the dam back into the watercourse and built some 30 gravel beds at various locations along the rapids.\n\ntive impact on biodiversity. For example, the potential depletion of oxygen caused by wastewater load impacts the living conditions at receiving water courses.\n\nWe want to increase the role of biodiversity in our business to respond to the current and future ecological challenges. In 2020, we linked the margin of a EUR 750 million revolving credit facility to the biodiversity enhancement in our forests in Finland. In 2022, we further strengthened this link by including biodiversity as a measure in UPM's management remuneration. We have also joined the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Program to develop and test tools, methodology and guidance for setting science-based targets for the preservation of nature.\n\n## Forestry and biodiversity\n\nWe safeguard biodiversity in our own forests and continue to implement our\n\nIn Central Finland, we dismantled the Arvajankoski dam, replaced the old fishway with a natural fishway and built new spawning sites. The 19-kilometre rapids route is an important spawning river for the endangered P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne trout. In total, the restoration of the rapids freed up a habit of more than 55 kilometres for migratory fish.\n\nOur aim is to revive stream species in locations offering the best conditions for their natural success. The measures must be designed to best suit each body of water. Our work to protect species will continue in the coming years.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Healthy forests ensuring the vitality of our business\n- \u00b7 Resilient forests adapting to changing climate\n- \u00b7 Increased variety of species and thriving ecosystems\n\n## TARGET\n\n- \u00b7 Enhancing biodiversity\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Global forest biodiversity programme since 1998\n- \u00b7 Global Forest Action programme since 2022\n- \u00b7 Stream water programme since 2016\n- \u00b7 Best Available Techniques used at production sites\n- \u00b7 Indicator and follow-up development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCASE\n\n## DEADWOOD AS A MEASURE OF BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn 2018, we set the target of positive impact on biodiversity in our forests in Finland while efficiently producing high-quality wood raw material. In 2022, we set a new target to double the amount of deadwood in our commercial forests from the current level of about 5 cubic metres to 10 cubic metres per hectare.\n\nIn UPM's protected areas and commercial forests where a specific nature management target has been set, the deadwood target is 20 cubic metres per hectare. The new targets are part of our forest responsibility programme, UPM Forest Action.\n\nThe indicators used to measure biodiversity are based on comparing natural forests with commercial forests. Studies have shown that one clear difference between these two types of forests is the amount of deadwood. More than a fifth of Finland's forest species-fungi and insects in particulardepend on deadwood at some point in their lives. Buffer zones for bodies of water also increase the amount of deadwood.\n\nThe amount of deadwood in UPM's forests is based on data from the National Forest Inventory (VMI) of the Natural Resources Institute of Finland (Luke). We will also study the accumulation of deadwood and its impact on biodiversity in co-operation with Luke.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility/forests\n\nbiodiversity activities as part of the new global Forest Action programme, launched in 2022. The programme considers the various regional regulation, requirements and guidelines regarding forest management in Finland, Uruguay and the US.  In 2018, we set a new target of net positive impact on biodiversity in our forests in Finland with dedicated key performance indicators to measure the progress.\n\nIn Uruguay, plantations grow on grasslands formerly used for cattle grazing. The biodiversity values of the area are assessed before the plantation is established, and all valuable biodiversity hotspots and native forests are protected. Our work focuses on invasive species control and the active management of protected habitats. The majority of species indicators from the last five years show a positive trend of occurrence compared to the last 15 years.\n\nIn Finland, we have nine indicators: share of broadleaved trees, amount of deadwood, forest age, forest structure, protected areas, valuable habitats, habitat restoration, species and habitat projects and indicator development. In 2022, all quantitative indicators showed a positive trend. The share of broadleaved trees increased and the protected area continued to grow.\n\nIn our forestry operations in the US, we consider and restore the forest's natural diversity by aligning management actions with the forest's natural ecology. All harvest sites are managed so that deadwood is retained at sustainable levels. In 2022, 368 hectares were restored with natural species mixtures.\n\nForest certification plays a crucial role in managing biodiversity in wood sourcing. Since 2022, biodiversity-related activities in all regions are incorporated in our Forest Action programme.\n\n## Water and biodiversity\n\nIn Finland, our hydropower plants impact the environment by altering river flow rates and their ecosystems. We have taken voluntary measures to restore migratory fish stocks, in addition to statutory levies on fisheries, to mitigate the production impacts.\n\nUPM's stream water programme strives to remove obstacles to fish migration and restore fish stocks all around Finland. Sev-\n\neral projects have already been completed and new potential projects are actively being sought and identified.\n\nTo steer our activities and to measure our impact on biodiversity, we have launched a new indicator with a target of 500 km of obstacle-free streams by 2030. By 2022, we reached 174 km in total. Our largest project was the restoration of two rapids that reopened over 150 km of routes for migratory fish (left).\n\n## Mills and biodiversity\n\nIndustrial emissions to water and air also have an impact on biodiversity. Emissions change the ecological living environment of different species. In the past, acidifying flue gases worsened air quality, for example. Today, thanks to modern technology, harmful emissions can be neutralised, allowing sensitive species such as lichen to return. Water quality has also improved as a result of advanced best available techniques.\n\nFor example, at the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay, we monitor e/ffluent discharge to the river as well as water quality and biology in the river itself, together with emissions to the air, air quality and soil quality. Studies show that, since the start-up in 2007, mill operations have had no measurable negative impact on biodiversity. In addition to the actions taken in line with the global forest biodiversity programme, many mill sites have actively been promoting biodiversity at a local scale. UPM Schongau in Germany and UPM J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski in Finland have created dozens of bird nests and left part of their mill area in its natural state, for example.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPositive impact on forest biodiversity\n\nOverall positive development measured in Finland and in Uruguay\n\n- Value from responsibility on page 28\n- Our 2030 responsibility targets on page 30\n- Climate-positive forestry on page 82\n- River Kymi's condition improved on page 91",

Our energy portfolio consists mostly of energy sources that do not cause fossil CO 2 emissions.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Minimising the use of fossil fuels is the most important way to mitigate climate change\n- \u00b7 Supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy\n- \u00b7 Decarbonising traffic\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Significantly cut fossil CO 2 emissions across the whole supply chain and increase energy efficiency\n- \u00b7 Minimise other air emissions in production and transportation\n\nThe global energy sector accounts for over 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions. To cut the emissions from fossil fuels, more renewable and low-emission energy is needed. Wind and solar power are growing exponentially, but they are dependent on weather conditions. This increases volatility in both electricity supply and prices. Therefore, the transforming energy markets need nuclear energy for stability, hydropower and natural gas for balancing, and innovations for electricity storage capability. Managing electricity markets has become a balancing act.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine pushed the energy markets into crisis as several former supply channels were no longer available. Fossil-based emissions need to be cut and therefore the electrification of society with low-emission sources is accelerating. At the same time, the security of the electricity\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Committed to the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C and The Climate Pledge\n- \u00b7 Committed to continuous improvements in energy efficiency and to an increased share of renewable and low-emission energy\n- \u00b7 Optimising our energy use and offer flexibility\n- \u00b7 Science-based targets of our CO 2 emissions reduction\n- \u00b7 Use of Best Available Techniques (BAT)\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\nsupply has become more important. All this drives demand for low-emission electricity.\n\n## A unique dual role\n\nUPM is the second largest electricity producer in Finland but also the largest consumer of electricity. We contribute to maintaining the balance of the electricity system by helping when there is a risk of electricity shortages, either by reducing consumption at our paper mills or by increasing production at our hydropower plants.\n\nWe are consistently developing our energy portfolio, growing our CO 2 -free electricity generation in UPM Energy and switching our energy-consuming businesses to lower-emission energy sources. We are contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity system by growing the supply of reliable, emission-free electricity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n65% reduction of UPM's total CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from 2015 level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n34%\n\nreduction achieved\n\n20% reduction of acidifying flue gases from 2015 level\n\n28%\n\nachieved for the UPM average product\n\nWe generate significantly more electricity than we consume, and this net selling position will increase to over 7 TWh when the OL3 nuclear power plant unit in Finland and the new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay are fully operational.\n\n## Flexibility in the electricity market\n\nEnergy is no longer just a raw material. Managing the whole electricity system is now essential. That requires more flexibility from households and industries, and a well-functioning, open market that ensures supply and demand stay in balance.\n\nElectrification of the whole economy is,\n\nThis is also good business for us, as we time electricity generation to the high-consumption hours and electricity consumption to the low-consumption hours.\n\nhowever, not possible. We also need other solutions to mitigate climate change. UPM Biofuels is supplying renewable fuels for decarbonising tra/ffic. We are also studying business cases for utilising green hydrogen and biogenic CO 2 to possibly produce synthetic fuels and chemicals in the future.\n\nThe energy crisis has caused energy prices to rise in Europe. It has also increased the risks related to political interventions and changes in energy market regulation and taxation. It is crucial that such measures do not reduce the incentives for energy investments that drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. Regulatory measures should not interfere with the market price signal, which is needed to balance the electricity markets in all circumstances.\n\n## Several ongoing projects\n\nWe favour the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. UPM Energy is a major energy provider in Finland with assets in Finnish hydropower and nuclear power, as well as thermal power to a lesser extent. Hydropower is the most e/ffective and sustainable method of producing balancing power for the volatile electricity grid. Nuclear power provides a reliable baseload generation of electricity; it relies on Finland's unique and safe solution for the final disposal of spent fuel. 95% of UPM Energy's electricity is emission-free. The start of OL3 in April 2023 will increase UPM Energy's CO 2 -free electricity generation by nearly 50%.\n\nUPM Energy also completed the extensive modernisation project of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in early 2023. Ultracapacitors have been installed at two\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WE PARTICIPATE IN ENERGY ACTIONS\n\nWe invest in sustainable energy supply, which supports the transformation of energy systems in Germany and Finland. UPM Nordland Papier's new combined heat and power plant enables us to reduce dependency on the energy grid and actively participate in the German electricity market.\n\n## Electricity generation and consumption by country\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhydropower plants to provide energy storage for rapid reaction to demand changes.\n\nThe majority of our energy consumption is due to the production processes at the paper and pulp mills, where electricity and heat are needed for mechanical pulping, pumping and drying. We generate steam and electricity through combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Biomass-based fuels account for 65% (70%) of our fuel usage at production sites.  The temporary decrease is due to the strike at the Finnish mills at the beginning of the year. At some mills, all or part of the required energy is produced\n\nAlso, four new dual-fueled LNG vessels have been taken in use in European sea routes during 2022, and three of them will be in service by end of the first quarter in 2023.\n\nUPM H\u00fcrth's biomass boiler, installed by E.ON, will supply carbon-neutral heat and electricity to the mill and the public power grid from 2023 onwards. The use of biomass, i.e., residual wood from the region, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and slows down global warming.\n\nAt UPM Tervasaari, we are now using an electric boiler alongside the gas boiler to produce the steam required for the mill's production\n\nby external or co-owned power plants or provided by UPM Energy.\n\n## Continuous improvement in energy efficiency\n\nWe are looking for ways to improve our energy e/fficiency across our operations with audits, innovations and investments. Improvements usually lead to a reduction in CO 2 and other air emissions as well.\n\nWe took a number of measures at many paper mills in 2022. In Germany, we implemented evaporative cooling of the intake air on the gas turbine at UPM Plattling, an advanced process control for process optimisation at UPM Augsburg's deinking plant and a new heat exchanger for one paper machine at UPM Schongau. At UPM Caledonian in\n\nprocesses. The new boiler will improve steam production efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions. Heat recovery will also be improved.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, a new Finnish wind farm will begin supplying renewable energy to UPM's paper mills.\n\nThese investments are expected to lead to a reduction of, at minimum, 300,000 t of fossil CO 2 emissions.",

        "page_content": "the UK, we will invest in vacuum blowers in 2023 to replace pump systems, which will significantly reduce the site's electricity use.\n\nUPM Plywood has started projects to reduce steam consumption and air emissions by preheating and improved heat recovery at the UPM Pellos plywood mill.\n\nUPM Timber will implement a new heat pump system at the UPM Korkeakoski sawmill in 2023. This will decrease SO 2 and NOx emissions as well as energy use. Sawn timber kilning is typically handled with heat generated from the wood bark, and the plant uses the waste heat generated during drying.\n\nAs a result of our energy-saving investments and actions taken in 2022, we reduced our energy costs by EUR 8.5 million (1.7 million), avoided emitting 34,900 (5,400) tonnes of CO 2 and achieved a 114,000 (33,000) MWh reduction in energy consumption. The annual savings were EUR 9.5 million (1.9 million), 40,500 (6,100) tonnes of CO 2 and 126,000 (35,000) MWh of energy.\n\n## Follow-up on our 2030 targets\n\nOur energy portfolio consists mostly of energy sources that do not cause fossil CO 2 emissions. In 2022, we decreased our fossil CO 2 emissions from energy generation (Scope 1) and purchased energy (Scope 2) by 11% compared to the previous year, which is in line with our 65% reduction target for 2030. The main reason for the reduction is the increased use of emission-free electricity at our pulp and paper mills in Finland.\n\nDue to the strike in Finland in early 2022\n\nCASE\n\n## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE DEVELOPING HYDROGEN ECONOMY\n\nGreen and emission-free hydrogen plays a key role in the EU's plans to achieve climate goals, increase energy self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on fossil energy sources. The EU's goal is to produce 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable green hydrogen in Europe and import the same amount. The aim of this is to replace natural gas, coal and oil in transport and industry.\n\nand Russia's war in Ukraine, coal and peat usage increased by 3%, after a decrease of 9% in 2021. Our target is to stop using coal and peat for on-site energy generation by 2030. Currently, coal is the main fuel at the UPM Changshu paper mill in China, where alternatives have not been available historically. Peat is used in Finland.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved our target for acidifying flue gases (NOx and SO 2 ). We did not reach our target of increasing energy e/fficiency by 1% annually. However, an improvement of 0.3% was achieved compared to 2021.\n\n## Collaboration with suppliers to reduce CO 2 emissions\n\nWe set a target to reduce the fossil CO 2 emission levels from materials and logistics by 30% by 2030 from 2018 levels. To reach this target we launched our -30 by 30 programme in 2022 (right). New and existing suppliers are required to provide data about the carbon footprint of goods and services provided to UPM. This includes all the relevant emissions from the supplier's own upstream supply chain and operations. Almost 70% of our pigment supplies is already covered with primary CO 2 emissions data from suppliers, and almost 60% of our deliveries is calculated based on supplier data already.\n\nIn addition to fossil CO 2 emissions from our own energy generation (Scope 1) and purchased energy (Scope 2), we also evaluate the emissions from other indirect sources (Scope 3), such as purchased materials, transportation and the processing of sold products.\n\nUPM produces emission-free energy in the form of hydropower and, through shareholdings, nuclear power. We already use hydrogen in our industrial processes, particularly to produce advanced biofuels to be used in transport. We also have significant amounts of biogenic CO 2 available at the UPM pulp mills.\n\nThis biogenic CO 2 will be a key resource to achieve a fully sustainable hydrogen economy in the future.

These emissions account for a third of our total carbon footprint.\n\nOur goal is to reduce the CO 2 emissions in the value chain by 30% from 2018 levels by 2030. We aim to reach this goal with the -30 by 30 programme in close co-operation with our partners and suppliers.\n\nThe first phase of the programme involves collecting emissions data from suppliers of goods and services. Using the information, we can determine an accurate baseline for the products and services that we procure from very different types of companies internationally.\n\nThe quickest way to reduce emissions involves improving energy and operational efficiency and making technological improvements. In the future, when selecting our suppliers and partners and developing our product portfolio, we will take into account the climate impacts of the products or services we purchase, as well as their quality, delivery time and price.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\n## ELECTRICITY GENERATION THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n| TWh           |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Mill CHP      |    4.3 |    5.5 |\n| Hydropower    |    3   |    3.5 |\n| Nuclear power |    5.4 |    4.7 |\n| Thermal power |    0.5 |    0.3 |\n| Total         |   13.2 |   14   |\n\n| ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION   |   ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION | ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| TWh                       |                    2022   | 2021                      |\n| Total                     |                       9.7 | 11. 7                     |\n\n## CAPACITY TO GENERATE POWER THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n|                                          | Nominal MW   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Hydropower                               | 729          |\n| Nuclear power                            | 588          |\n| Thermal power                            | 154          |\n| UPM Energy in total                      | 1, 471       |\n| Mill site combined heat  and power (CHP) | 1,250        |\n| Mill site hydropower                     | 7            |\n| Mill site power  generation in total     | 1,257        |\n| Total UPM                                | 2,728        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 2\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new model will be implemented in the ports of Rauma, Hamina, Kotka and Pietarsaari in Finland.\n\nThe latest commitment to the Baltic Sea Action Group (BSAG) was made for 20222026, focusing on promoting BSAG's Ship Waste Action initiative. It has established a model whereby cargo ship effluents are discharged at the port and their nutrients are recycled through circular economy solutions. We are exploring opportunities to use recycled nutrients from ship-generated wastewater in our own wastewater treatment plants, for example. This contributes to our 2030 target of using only recycled nutrients in our wastewater treatment plants.\n\nWe and BSAG will also explore the possibility of discharging cargo hold washing waters on land for possible further reuse.\n\ncesses' together with several industrial and academic partners. The project was initiated by the Finnish innovation cluster CLIC. In 2022, as a result of this project, a measurement method for microplastics in water is under development, together with universities, in our research centre in Lappeenranta.\n\nIn Uruguay, we continue supporting the Rio Negro Initiative to improve the status of the river. We are also funding the refurbishment of the municipal wastewater treatment plant and sewer systems in Paso de los Toros and neighbouring towns where temporary and permanent housing facilities have been built.\n\n## www.upm.com/responsibility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RIVER KYMI'S CONDITION IMPROVED\n\nThe Water and Environment Association of the River Kymi has been researching the state of the river for over 50 years. The first measurements describing the state of the ecological region at the lowest level of the river, the benthic zone, were published in 1968. The methods and the accuracy related to species diversity measurement have improved over the years. In 2018, the benthic survey of the River Kymi rapids was carried out for the first time in joint monitoring, where samples were taken from upstream rapids of the UPM Kymi mill and from four rapids downstream of the load. In all the rapids in the main river, the benthic fauna corresponded very well to the benthic community of a natural rapids area according to the ecological state variables. Species classified as threatened were also present. The condition and biodiversity of the river have improved considerably compared to past decades as wastewater treatment methods have become more efficient.\n\nThe latest results, published in 2022, indicate that the environmental impact of the UPM Kymi mills' water load on the midge communities is low and that the benthic communities indicate a slightly oligotrofic river condition, i.e., having a low level of nutrients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a signatory of the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate, we follow recognised principles in water stewardship. We use water in a way that is environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically beneficial.\n\nCDP recognised UPM with an A score for its significant actions to enhance water stewardship.\n\n## Our water management\n\nPulp and paper production is our most water-intensive operation. Approximately 95% of the water we use in production is internally recirculated, and only a small fraction eventually leaves the process as e/ffluent and needs to be replaced. Using less water also means using less energy and fewer chemicals.\n\nAccording to the water risk analysis carried out with the help of the WWF Water Risk Filter tool, our production sites are in areas with low to medium water scarcity. The tool also provides scenarios on water risks related to climate change for 2030 and 2050. The scenarios also show that our main production sites are in areas of low to medium basin risk, with only one exception. While the UPM Changshu paper mill near Shanghai is expected to face the highest rise in water risk by 2050, the mill has made substantial improvements in water e/fficiency in recent years, leading to a 21% reduction of process wastewater volume over the last five years.\n\nAll wastewater from our pulp and paper mills is cleaned in both mechanical and biological e/ffluent treatment processes.\n\n## Continuous improvement towards 2030 targets\n\nEach pulp and paper mill has a dedicated plan to reach its reduction targets related to water use and e/ffluent load by 2030. In 2022, we made a number of improvements in the paper machine and pulp drying machine process controls and assessed the water saving potential of those actions through several studies.\n\nExploring new ways of working, new technologies and new partnerships with potential chemical and machinery suppliers continued in 2022. Some of the new technologies, such as using new water fractions from our future biorefinery, were piloted.\n\nSeveral mills have started to use advanced process controls and predictive analytic models to optimise their wastewater treatment plant. Together with the supplier, a new method based on image analysis of bio-sludges was also investigated to improve the monitoring of the e/ffluent treatment process.\n\nUPM Augsburg paper mill in Germany has successfully tested a new filtration process to replace warm water used in paper machine showers. The technology would allow the mill to reduce water use even further from an already 'best of the class' level. The work will continue in 2023.\n\nWe have a target to use 100% nutrients from recycled sources in our e/ffluent treatment by 2030. In 2022, 33% (35%) was achieved. For example, the UPM Changshu paper mill in China has further increased the ratio to almost 80% in 2022 by replacing urea with its side stream product ammonia. Reject waters from the biogas plant are now in regular use to replace urea at the UPM Tervasaari wastewater treatment leading to a 43% share of recycled nutrients.\n\nBoth UPM Kaukas and UPM Pietarsaari pulp mills in Finland improved their water management during the year. At UPM Kaukas, we invested in the softwood fibre line, reducing the COD load (Chemical Oxygen Demand). At UPM Pietarsaari, modifications were made to the bleaching processes of the two production lines to decrease chemical consumption and improve the wastewater treatment plant operations.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nIn 2021, we joined a two-year project 'Circular Economy of Water in Industrial Pro-",

Our environmental 2030 targets ensure resource e/fficiency and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## Our circularity targets\n\nBy 2030, we will not deposit any process waste at landfill sites, and no process waste will be incinerated without recovering the energy. On average in 2022, 90% (89%) of our process waste was recycled or recovered, of which 21% is energy recovery. Today, 58% (59%) of our production sites use 100% of the process waste. The total amount of waste to landfills decreased by 40% (3%) compared to 2021. This was due to the four months' strike in Finland, the sale of UPM Shotton paper mill and the continuous improvement e/fforts at all sites.\n\nWe share best practices, research results and ideas throughout the company, and have several internal working groups focusing on the use and valorisation of side streams. Green liquor dregs are a side stream originating from pulp production and one of our most challenging residues to use. We are putting a lot of e/ffort into developing ways to find a sustainable use for it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PLASTIC SAWN/uniF6BATIMBER WRAPPING RECYCLED\n\nUPM Timber and Lassila & Tikanoja, a recycling company, have launched a new recycling concept where the used plastic sawn-timber wrapping is picked up from customers and recycled into new wrapping. The Finnish log-house manufacturer Honkarakenne was also involved in piloting the recycling concept.\n\nPlastic wrapping that was previously sent to energy waste is now collected from customers for further processing at L&T's plastic recycling plant. At the plant, the material is washed and renewed into recycled granulate, which is then used for\n\nOur other circularity target is to use 100% nutrients from recycled sources in our e/ffluent treatment by 2030. In 2022, 33% (35%) was achieved.\n\n## Making use of residues, side streams and recovered materials\n\nMost organic production residues, such as bark, wood residues and fibre-containing solids from deinking and e/ffluent treatment, are used to generate energy for mill sites. The fibrous residues that are not incinerated are used in brick manufacturing or as soil amendment materials.\n\nThe UPM Caledonian paper mill in Scotland, in particular, has significantly improved the use rate of their ash despite challenges due to changes in local regulation. The mill has explored several recovery options in recent years. Using ash in the manufacturing of cement blocks is today the main end use and has resulted in an ash\n\nOverall, ash originating from biomass-based energy generation makes up the largest share of our solid waste. In 2022, 97% (96%) of the ash was used in various applications, such as in soil stabilisation, road construction and the cement industry, or internally to replace caustic soda or as raw material for paper filler production.\n\nthe re-manufacturing of new sawn-timber wrappers. The customers also receive compensation for their recycling collaboration.\n\nThe concept has been welcomed by customers. The recycling concept began in Finland, but we are exploring opportunities to expand it to foreign-export customers. Earlier in 2022, UPM Timber switched to sawn-timber wrapping containing recycled plastic. The long-term goal is to stop using fossil-based plastics altogether. In the future, sawn-timber wrappers could be made of wood raw material, other bioplastics or a combination of the two.\n\nwww.upmtimber.com",

Product safety, sustainable forest management, recyclability, circularity and ecolabels are also highly valued.\n\n## Sustainable product design\n\nOur Sustainable Product Design concept, developed in 2021, enables us to further develop the environmental and societal aspects of our products. We have been working on several product development cases with businesses in 2022 and have tested this concept and defined solid sustainability value propositions. As an example, UPM Specialty Papers used the concept successfully in its packaging paper development (left).\n\nAccording to our assessments, our new products have had significant positive impacts on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, when we use less material, replace fossil raw material with renewable material or when recyclability is improved, we promote SDG 12.

Our governance structure supports good management, responsible business operations and compliance at all levels, with clear responsibilities and reporting lines.\n\nUPM complies with all recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code (CG Code), which is issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association. In accordance with the CG Code, we have published our Corporate Governance Statement (CG Statement) for the financial year 2022. It is available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/ governance. We can refer to the CG Statement for information on:\n\n- \u00b7  Our governance structure and management system\n- \u00b7  The duties and responsibilities of our management bodies\n- \u00b7  The duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its Committees\n- \u00b7  Our management and control procedures related to internal control, risk management, internal audit, insider administration and related party transactions\n\n## General Meeting of shareholders\n\nOur Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2022 took place in Helsinki on 29 March 2022. The proposals by the Board of Directors and the Nomination and Governance Committee to the AGM were published in January and the notice of the AGM was published in February. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the AGM was arranged under the Finnish temporary Legislative Act (375/2021) and held without the share-\n\nMessukeskus, Helsinki (an exhibition and convention centre) on 12 April. Detailed instructions for shareholders wishing to participate in the meeting or follow the webcast are available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2023. For the year 2022, the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of EUR 1.50 per share to be paid in two instalments.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n- \u00b7  Sets the Company's strategic objectives\n- \u00b7  Reviews the management team's performance in terms of meeting these objectives\n- \u00b7  Reviews and approves financial and other plans relevant to the achievement of these objectives\n\nThe Board's other primary responsibilities relate to the integrity of the Company's financial reporting, the e/ffectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and the appointment, remuneration and succession planning of the Company's senior management.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThe composition of the Board changed in 2022 when Berndt Brunow, UPM's Director since 2002, announced that he would not be available for re-election. The Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole. This includes whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities. As a result of a careful selection process, the Nomination and Governance Committee proposed nine members be elected to UPM's Board of Directors for a one-year term.\n\nAs proposed by the Nomination and Governance Committee, Henrik Ehrnrooth, Emma FitzGerald, Jari Gustafsson, Piia-Noora Kauppi, Marjan Oudeman, Martin \u00e0 Porta, Kim Wahl and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos were re-elected, whilst Topi Manner was elected as a new director. All directors are non-executive and their term of o/ffice will end upon the closure of the AGM 2023. The shareholders were asked to vote for the\n\n## Governance framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe illustration below summarises the basic regulatory framework for our/uni00A0governance.\n\nholders and their proxy representatives being present at the meeting venue. UPM also o/ffered a proxy authorisation service, whereupon shareholders had the possibility to authorise an independent proxy representative nominated by the Company.\n\nThis exceptional AGM arrangement was necessary to ensure the health and safety of the shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, as well as to organise the meeting in a predictable way, allowing equal means for shareholders to participate whilst also ensuring compliance with the prevailing restrictions set by the authorities at that time. The shareholders could participate and exercise their shareholder rights at the AGM by voting in advance, as well as submitting counterproposals and asking questions in writing in advance. A total of 2,737 (2,542) shareholders were represented at the meeting and they represented 58.1% (54.2%) of the Company's shares and voting rights at the time of the AGM. The AGM supported all of the proposals and all decisions at the meeting were made in accordance with the proposals by the Board\n\nof Directors, as well as the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee.\n\nThe AGM adopted the Company's Financial Statements and decided to distribute the same dividend of EUR 1.30 per share as for the previous year and released the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2021. The dividends, totalling EUR 693 million, were paid on 7 April 2022 to the shareholders who were registered on our list of registered shareholders on 31 March 2022. UPM's Remuneration Report 2021 for governing bodies was presented to and adopted by the AGM. Information on other decisions made at the AGM can be found later on in this section and on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2022.\n\nThe shareholders and the public were able to follow the whole meeting, including greetings by the Board Chair and a review by the President and CEO, via a webcast. The recorded speeches were further made available after the AGM on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2022.\n\nThe AGM 2023 will be held at the",

The Nomination and Governance Committee also believes that this practice helps to ensure that the Board works e/ffectively as a whole, whilst comprising of su/fficiently diverse members with varied experience and versatile areas of expertise that mutually complement each other.\n\nThe composition of the Board is presented in the table below. The new director, Topi Manner (born 1974), is a Finnish citizen and holds a Master's degree in Economics and Business Administration from the University of Turku. Manner has been the President and CEO of Finnair Plc since 2019. Previously, he was a member of Nordea Group's Executive Management and their Head of Personal Banking 2016-2018. He also held various other executive roles at Nordea from 2006-2016. He is a Board member for Elisa Corporation and Service Sector Employers PALTA and Chair of the Audit Committee for IATA (the International Air Transport Association).\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe overall aim of diversity is for the Board, as a whole, to have a broad range of skills, experience and perspectives, as well as knowledge of UPM and other relevant industries, so that the Board can e/ffectively accomplish its responsibilities, in particular those pertaining to strategy and risk management.

Information on the professional backgrounds of the Board of Directors and their other significant commitments is available on pages 112-113 of this report.\n\nThe Board's diversity principles are included in the Board and Committee Charters and, more specifically, in the Board's Diversity Policy, available at www.upm. com/governance. More information on UPM Board diversity, its related objectives and the results obtained is available in our CG Statement 2022.\n\n## Director independence\n\nWith the assistance of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors evaluates the independence of its members both annually and on a continuous basis. Director independence is assessed based on the independence criteria of the Finnish CG Code.

According to the Nomination and Governance Committee's assessment, all directors are independent of both the Company and the significant shareholders. High attendance rates at the Board and Committee meetings prove the Board members' commitment and availability for Board-related work. The attendance rates at the meetings by each member are in the table on the previous page.\n\nAccording to the evaluation carried out by the Board with the assistance of the Nomination and Governance Committee, all Board members are independent of the Company's significant shareholders, as the Company has no controlling shareholder and none of the Company's shareholders have announced a holding of 10% or more of the Company's shares or votes attached thereto.\n\nBoard diversity - gender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nassesses the independence of members of the Board of Directors on a continuous basis.

The roots, long history and strong will for continuous renewal are visible in the culture. There is room for innovation and success is rewarded. The business model enables strategy to be implemented across various businesses and empowers people to act. The strategy packages everything into a common direction.'\n\n'UPM's purpose guides the activities of all business areas and personnel in the short and long term. The purpose is like a map on which thinking and actions can be linked. I hope it also inspires UPM's customers, owners and other stakeholders.'\n\nManner, who has had a long career at Nordea, says his leadership style is entrepreneurial. It could be defined as being focused on responsibility, initiative and determination. 'I believe in teams of diverse people and building teams is an important part of leadership. I strive to be an approachable people-oriented leader who communicates the direction and rationale for decisions and motivates people.'\n\nAll directors are non-executive and the Board has also concluded that all directors are independent of the Company, including Kim Wahl and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, who have been non-executive directors of the Company for 10 or more consecutive years. Based on the Board's overall evaluation of the independence of these directors, their long-standing service does not compromise their independence and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could a/ffect their independence.\n\n## Board-related work in 2022\n\nThe Board convened according to its original meeting schedule and held 14 meetings in 2022. Its work was not disrupted, even during the continued exceptional circumstances in spring 2022 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThere is no minimum meeting attendance requirement for Board members. Instead, Board members are expected to attend all meetings unless there is a valid reason for not attending. The average attendance of the Board members at the Board meetings was 100% (98.8%) and 89.0% (100%) at the Committee meetings. The personal attendance rate of each Board member is presented in the table on page 105. In connection with its meetings, the Board also held non-executive sessions and non-executive sessions with the external auditor.\n\n## Strategic focus points in 2022\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved strategic plans during its strategy session in May. The main focus points of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be growth, performance, innovation, responsibility and portfolio. Read more about our strategy on pages 20-21. An essential part of the Board's annual strategy-related work is to oversee the assessment and management of risks related to the Company's strategy and operations. These risks and opportunities, as well as their impact on operations and strategy, are described on pages 32-33 and 132.\n\nIn 2022, the Board continued to focus on major strategic investments, most notably the pulp mill project in Uruguay and the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany. The Board has been closely monitoring the status and the feasibility of the project in Uruguay since 2016\n\nand has conducted several status reviews, including risk assessments, in its meetings since then. The investment will raise UPM's pulp production capacity by more than 50% and significantly contribute to future earnings. Read more about this strategic investment on pages 40-41 and on the corporate website at www.upmpasodelostoros.com.\n\nThe investment decision on the new biorefinery in Germany was made in January 2020 and the Board has regularly reviewed the status and feasibility of this project. The biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals that will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. Read more about this strategic investment on pages 54-55 and on the corporate website at www.upmbiochemicals.com/biorefinery.\n\n## Board performance evaluation\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual evaluation on its performance and working methods, including an evaluation of the performance and working methods of its Committees.\n\nThe overall results of the 2022 self-evaluation were highly favourable and indicated that the Board, the Chair of the Board and the Board Committees are performing e/ffectively, and that the Board members are committed to Board work. Identified areas for improvement are considered when planning Board-related work and the Nomination and Governance Committee takes the results into consideration when preparing its proposal for the composition of the Board for the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn 2022, the evaluation was conducted as a self-evaluation in November and its results were reviewed and discussed at the Board meeting in December. The Board members evaluated the performance of the Board and its Committees in relation to their respective duties and responsibilities, their compositions and structure, Board culture, the e/ffectiveness of the Board and Committee meetings, the individual performance of the Board members and the performance of the Chair of the Board.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established the following three Committees to further improve the\n\nment and amongst Committee members.\n\nThe Company has an obligation to organise an audit firm selection procedure in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation concerning the audit for the financial year 2024 (mandatory auditor rotation). To prepare for the mandatory rotation, the Annual General Meeting held on 29 March 2022 resolved on amending the article 8 of the Articles of Association to allow the Annual General Meeting to elect the auditor also in advance for a term of one financial year.\n\nThe Audit Committee has prepared the Board's proposal for the election and remuneration of the auditors for the financial years 2023 and 2024, to be presented at the AGM 2023. When preparing the proposal for the financial year 2023, the Committee evaluated the qualifications and independence of the auditor, as well as the audit-related and non audit-related services provided by the auditor. The evaluation included an assessment of the effectiveness of the audit process, the quality of the audit, the performance of the lead auditor and audit team and the co-operation with the auditor's international audit network. As a result of the evaluation, the Committee recommended the re-election of PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy as the Company's auditor for the financial year 2023. Following the stipulations of the Audit Regulation, the last financial year that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy can act as the Company's auditor is 2023.\n\nWith regard to the proposal for the financial year 2024, the Audit Committee has prepared its recommendation in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation and organised a statutory audit firm selection procedure. The Committee has reviewed potential audit firm candidates and identified Ernst & Young Oy and Deloitte Oy as the best candidates for the global audit engagement of the Company. These candidates have been evaluated against a variety of selection criteria such as proposed audit plan and methodology, experience and composition of the audit team, audit quality, and price. The selection process included multiple rounds of information submissions, testing of technological capabilities, interviews and presentations by the candidates as well as external reference checks.

The members were appointed to the Board Committees in the Board's constitutive meeting on 29 March 2022. The Committee compositions are presented in the table on the left. Neither the President and CEO nor other Company executives may be members of any Board Committees.\n\nThe written Committee Charters approved by the Board of Directors define the purpose, composition, operations and duties of each Committee, as well as the prerequisites of Committee membership. Each Committee is responsible for performing the duties assigned to it in its Charter. The Committee Charters are presented in the\n\nCG Statement and are also available at www.upm.com/governance. The Committees hold their meetings prior to Board meetings in order to prepare matters to be decided by the Board. The chairs of each Committee report on matters discussed and actions taken by the Committees during the Board meetings. In addition, minutes from the Committee meetings are available to the Board members for information purposes.\n\n## Committee-related work in 2022\n\nThe importance and extent of the work of the Committees has increased in recent years and will further increase following the continuous changes to the regulatory framework and the Company's business environment. This is also reflected in the Committee Charters and in the topics and matters that the Committees were involved with in addition to their regular duties throughout the year.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting processes and financial reporting, internal control, and internal audit and risk management, as well as monitoring the Company's audit and compliance procedures. In 2022, the Audit Committee held six meetings. In addition to the Audit Committee's assigned matters and regular reports as listed above, it also reviewed reports on and discussed cybersecurity, the audit tendering process, energy market topics, ESG, impacts on the environment and other non-financial matters (together with the review of non-financial reporting). The Board would respectively be informed as part of the Committee Chair's regular reporting to the Board if the Committee was provided concerns from the stakeholders analysed having a material impact on the economy, environment or people. Read more on our sustainable development on pages 58-99.\n\nThe lead audit partner attended all regular, pre-scheduled Committee meetings and reported to the Committee on interim procedures and findings, as well as quarterly audit and non-audit fees and services. The Committee's standard procedures also include quarterly sessions with the internal auditor, the lead audit partner, manage-",

Ernst & Young Oy has informed that Authorised Public Accountant Heikki Ilkka would act as the lead audit partner for the financial year 2024.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Company's remuneration principles and practices, as well as planning the remuneration and succession of the President and CEO and other senior executives.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee held four meetings. In addition to the Remuneration Committee's assigned matters and regular reports as listed above, it also discussed the performance measures of the incentive plans and made recommendations to the Board concerning the terms of planning the remuneration and succession of the President and CEO and other senior executives. Following the Remuneration Committee's recommendation, the Board decided to define three ESG-related performance measures (page 28) in the new performance share plan (PSP 2022-2024).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NEW CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMME LAUNCHED\n\nCybersecurity has become more important than ever before given the current geopolitical situation. In a networked world, potential attacks and consequences could also impact UPM's operations. Changing technology and regulations also require effective cyber-risk mitigation.\n\n## Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee is responsible for the composition, diversity and remuneration of the Board of Directors and corporate governance. If necessary, the Committee also identifies individuals who are qualified to serve as the President and CEO. In 2022, the Committee held five meetings. In addition to the Nomination and Governance Committee's assigned matters and regular reports as listed above, it also focused on extraordinary measures for the AGM pursuant to the Finnish temporary Legislative Act (375/2021) prevailing at that time. The Committee further focused on the search for a director and the succession plan for the Board and its Chair, as the latter announced in connection to the AGM 2022 that the commencing term would be his last as Chair.\n\nAs a result of careful research and selection e/fforts, the Nomination and Governance Committee has proposed that Pia Aaltonen-Forsell be elected as a new member of the Board at the AGM 2023. Of the incumbent directors, Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, the Chair of the Board, will not be available for\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole. This included whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities.\n\nAlthough our work on cybersecurity is based on continuous development, UPM launched a new cybersecurity improvement programme in 2022. The programme aims to prevent and mitigate cyber-risks, safeguard business continuity and protect against the misuse of our systems, networks and technologies.\n\nThe programme consists of eight solution streams and will run from 2022 to 2025. The programme's initial steps involve critical\n\nre-election. The Nomination and Governance Committee's proposal on the composition of the Board in 2023, along with the Board's assessment of the independence of potential Board members, is available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2023.\n\n## Executive management\n\nThe President and CEO's duty is to manage and oversee the Company's dayto-day business operations in accordance with the instructions and orders given by the Board of Directors. In the operative management of the Company, the President and CEO is assisted by the Group Executive Team, consisting of the executives leading business areas and global functions, the Business Area Boards and the Strategy Team.

Travel and accommodation expenses incurred from meetings held elsewhere than in a director's place of residence were paid against invoice. Shares purchased for the Board members in 2022 may not be transferred for two years from the purchase date (27 April 2022) or until the membership of the respective Board member has ended, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe approved annual fees and total remuneration of each Board member, as well as the number of shares purchased, are presented in the tables on the next page.",

It also includes information on omissions, additional explanations, and disclosures on the management approach. The document is available on the UPM webpage www.upm.com/responsibility.\n\nUPM is also committed to the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness, and impact as defined in the AA 1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard (2018).\n\nThe English version of the corporate responsibility information for 2022 has been assured by an independent third party, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy (see the Independent Assurance Report on the right) and identified in the GRI content index. Congruence between the English and Finnish version has been checked.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent practitioner's limited assurance report on UPM's Corporate Responsibility reporting\n\nTo the Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation\n\nWe have been engaged by the Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation (hereinafter also the 'Company') to perform a limited assurance engagement on selected corporate responsibility information for the reporting period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, disclosed in UPM-Kymmene Annual Report 2022 and on its website in section 'Responsibility' (hereinafter 'CR Reporting').\n\n## Selected corporate responsibility information\n\nThe selected corporate responsibility information within the scope of assurance covers:\n\n- \u00b7  UPM-Kymmene Corporation's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (2018).\n- \u00b7  The economic, social and environmental corporate responsibility indicators as identified in the GRI Content Index 2022 on the Company's website.\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is responsible for preparing the CR Reporting in accordance with the Reporting criteria as set out in UPM-Kymmene Corporation reporting instructions described in UPM-Kymmene Corporation's Annual Report 2022 and GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative.\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the prepara-\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact as set out in AccountAbility's AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard 2018.\n\ntion of the CR Reporting that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Practitioner's independence, other ethical requirements and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur multi-disciplinary team of corporate responsibility and assurance specialists possesses the requisite skills and experience within financial and non-financial assurance, corporate responsibility strategy and management, social and environmental issues, as well as the relevant industry knowledge, to undertake this assurance engagement.\n\n## Practitioner's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the CR Reporting and on the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other than\n\n## Regarding Inclusivity: UPM-Kymmene\n\nRegarding Materiality: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has a systematic process in place to evaluate and determine the materiality of corporate responsibility topics. Materiality analysis has been updated to reflect the updated GRI standard to better reflect the assessment of impact. We recommend that the Company continues to update its materiality assessment process and prepares for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requirements of materiality assessment.\n\nCorporation has processes in place for stakeholder inclusivity both at the group and at the business level. During 2022 UPM has completed two voluntary company-wide salary reviews, first eliminating unexplained gender pay gaps and second defining the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. We encourage UPM to continue its aim to be an employer that o/ffers fair pay and equal career opportunities for all.\n\nRegarding Responsiveness: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has processes in place for responding to stakeholder needs.

These standards require that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the CR Reporting is free from material misstatement.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other information in the CR Reporting, and about the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. The procedures Selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the CR Reporting and an assessment of the risks of the Company's material nonadherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\nIn addition, we have conducted our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard v3. For conducting a Type 2 assurance engagement as agreed with the Company, the AA1000ASv3 requires planning and performing of the assurance engagement to obtain moderate (limited) assurance on whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation does not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and that the CR Reporting is not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting criteria.\n\nOur work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7  Visiting the Company's Head O/ffice as well as two sites in Europe.\n- \u00b7  Interviewing of senior management of the Company.\n- \u00b7  Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the selected information on responsibility indicators at the Group level.\n- \u00b7  Interviewing employees from various organisational levels of the Company with regards to materiality, stakeholder expectations, meeting of those expectations, as well as stakeholder engagement.\n\n- \u00b7  Assessing stakeholder inclusivity and responsiveness based on the Company's documentation and internal communication.\n- \u00b7  Performing a media analysis and an internet search for references to the Company during the reporting period.\n- \u00b7  Assessing the Company's defined material corporate responsibility topics as well as assessing the related information based on these topics.\n- \u00b7  Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7  Considering the disclosure and presentation of the CR Reporting.\n- \u00b7  Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation's CR Reporting for the reporting period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria.\n\nWhen reading our limited assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of corporate responsibility information should be taken into consideration.\n\nFurthermore nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation does not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\nOur assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to UPM-Kymmene Corporation for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.\n\n## Observations and recommendations\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, we provide the following observations and recommendations in relation to UPM-Kymmene Corporation's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (2018).

        "page_content": "## Report of the Board of Directors\n\n## UPM introduction and business model\n\nAs a frontrunner in forest industry, UPM provides sustainable solutions to the growing global consumer demand. UPM's large product range covers pulp, graphic papers and specialty papers, self-adhesive labels, wood-based renewable diesel and naphtha, electricity as well as plywood and timber products. Products are made from renewable materials and are recyclable replacing fossil-based materials in various end-uses.\n\nUPM invests in sustainable growth and innovates for a future beyond fossils across six business areas: UPM Fibres, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers and UPM Plywood. The business areas are competitive with strong market positions.\n\nUPM group creates value to its stakeholders by operating separate businesses with a focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 Competitive and sustainable wood sourcing, forestry and plantation operations\n- \u00b7 Value adding, efficient and responsible global functions\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement programmes in commercial strategies, variable costs, working capital, site and maintenance costs, safety and environmental performance\n- \u00b7 Technology and intellectual property rights\n- \u00b7 A global business platform\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and effective capital allocation\n- \u00b7 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, UPM Code of Conduct and corporate policies\n\n## Market environment in 2022\n\nThe global economy slowed down during 2022, while inflation rose to approximately 9% - the highest level in decades. Global real GDP growth is projected at 3.0% in 2022. Geopolitical tensions, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia's war in Ukraine, disrupted global energy and food supplies, high energy prices, rising interest rates and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic caused economic growth to slow down. Still, global trade volumes continued to grow throughout 2022 and, together with the efforts to build a green world economy, they showed resilient demand for environmentally sustainable products.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine posed a geopolitical shock to Europe. Western sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russia's attempts to weaponise energy supplies against Western countries led to increasing geopolitical tensions, weaker macroeconomic conditions, and disrupted supply chains for certain commodities and products. This forced Western countries to intensify their focus on managing potential threats to global security and deal with fiscal pressures due to additional spending in energy and defence and simultaneous tightening of monetary policy of the European Central Bank.\n\nIn Europe, economic growth is projected at 3.6% in 2022. The economy continued to grow despite global uncertainty and the energy crisis. Domestic demand was good and H1 was strong, as a result of COVID-19-driven pent-up consumption which continued to drive demand for consumer services. Successful energy savings and measures to secure natural gas from alternative markets enabled countries to avoid short-term gas shortages caused by declining Russian supply. The economy was further stabilised by the labour market seeing record low unemployment. Simultaneously, inflation saw record high rates, driven by accelerating energy and food prices and continuing global supply\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n120\n\n## Clear roles and responsibilities\n\n| Group                  | Businesses                             |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Portfolio strategy     | Business area  strategies              |\n| Capital allocation     |                                        |\n| Business targets       | Commercial excellence                  |\n| Code of Conduct        | Operational excellence Cost efficiency |\n| Responsibility targets | measures Focused growth project        |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Outcomes\n\nTop performance Competitive advantage Value creation Stakeholder and societal value License to operate\n\nEach business area is responsible for executing its own strategy and achieving targets. Group direction and support from global functions enable the businesses to capture benefits from UPM's brand, scale and integration, while navigating the complex operating environment. Capital allocation decisions take place at the group level.\n\nCorporate responsibility is an integral part of all of our operations and a source of competitive advantage. UPM is committed to continuous improvement in financial, social and environmental performance. UPM promotes responsible practices throughout the value chain and is active in finding sustainable solutions, in co-operation with its customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nchain disruptions. As a result of high inflation followed by the interest rate hikes and the tightening household real incomes, consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in H2 2022, and industry confidence fell.\n\nThe US economy remained strong with a tight labour market, a historically low unemployment rate and a growing economy driven by good consumer spending. Economic growth in the US is projected at 2.0% in 2022. The US economy was resilient to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to manage the rapid rise in inflation. The US dollar strengthened to record highs against the euro and other major world currencies. On a negative note, trade tensions between the US and China intensified and raised increasing concerns regarding geopolitics and impacts on global trade.\n\nChina's economy faced the weakest growth on record, projected at 2.8% in 2022 as COVID-19 restrictions led to prolonged disruption in China's economic activity. Turmoil in international markets, lower net exports and the crisis in the Chinese property sector continued to slow down growth. China's debt ratio reached an all-time high, growth in retail sales continued to lag and household savings reached a new record high. The year ended with COVID-19 restrictions being lifted and a surge in COVID-19 cases, but with expectations of improving consumer confidence and a sustainable recovery of the economy.\n\nCalls for further action in the energy, industry, transport and buildings sectors, as well as in the food and financial systems, to tackle climate change continued. In line with the COP26 and COP27 meetings, additional net-zero commitments and capital towards a netzero world continued to be prioritised with a target to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Furthermore, in line with climate change mitigation\n\nobjectives, governments focused on energy savings and investments in low-emission energy supply to tackle the current energy crisis.\n\nA new set of goals and a framework to guide global actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 was agreed at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in 2022. The participants of COP15 also agreed to increase financing for biodiversity, driving funds toward sustainable investments and reducing harmful government subsidies.\n\nMarket demand for UPM's sustainable and renewable products was good, particularly in Europe and North America. Sales prices increased in all businesses, offsetting the impact of increased variable costs. UPM's input costs were significantly higher compared to 2021, most notably in energy.\n\nThe global demand for chemical pulp in 2022 was good. The average market prices for both northern bleached softwood (NBSK) and bleached hardwood kraft pulp (BHKP) increased in Europe and in China.\n\nEnergy prices and volatility in Europe reached unprecedented levels and the rise in energy futures increased the liquidity needs of energy industry companies. Electricity sales prices in Finland were at a record high, although prices on average stayed lower than in many other European markets. Optimised hydropower generation helped to stabilise the volatile markets. The first nuclear power test volumes generated from the new OL3 unit improved Finland's electricity selfsufficiency.\n\nIn Q1-Q3 2022, the demand for self-adhesive label materials was solid in Europe (excl. Russia) and North America while the markets were somewhat impacted by supply constraints. However in Q4, the demand declined in Europe and North America due to significant destocking in the value chain. In Asia, demand was relatively soft. Market prices increased in all main markets.\n\nThe global demand growth for label, release and packaging papers was good though demand became softer towards the end of the year. Market prices increased. Fine paper demand was impacted by the COVID-19 lockdowns and containment measures in China. Market prices for office papers in the Asia-Pacific region increased compared to 2021.\n\nDemand for graphic papers in Europe decreased by 12% compared to 2021. Market prices increased significantly for all paper grades. In H1 2022, demand for spruce plywood in Europe was strong. In H2, demand was softening due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry. Demand for birch plywood was strong in panel trading and industrial applications. Market prices increased in all enduses.\n\nThe timber business benefited from high levels of construction activity in H1 2022, and market prices saw record highs. In H2, the demandsupply balance weakened, and market prices fell under the peak level.\n\nStrong demand for advanced renewable fuels continued to be driven by climate targets. Market prices were at a high level.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the related containment measures around the world and the rapid changes in the global economy impacted the operating environment also in 2022 and continue to represent uncertainty.\n\n## Global economy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures resulted in a sharp decline in the global economy in 2020. In 2021, the global economy started to recover, but it is uncertain how long-lasting the recovery will be. Despite progress with vaccinations, additional waves of the pandemic in different parts of the world remain possible.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n121\n\nThe recovery of the global economy from the deep downturn in 2020, combined with the ongoing pandemic created tightness and disruptions globally in many supply chains, including logistics and energy. This caused rising costs and uncertainty about the price and availability of many raw materials and energy. China adopted a zerocovid policy that held back its economic growth through 2022. However, it opened up restrictions in December. This represents uncertainties regarding surging infections in the country, but also represents the potential to increase economic activity.\n\n## Safety and business continuity\n\nUPM has implemented extensive precautions to protect the health and safety of its employees and to ensure business continuity and the progression of its strategic projects during the pandemic. Despite these efforts, the operation of one or more units or the supply chain and logistics could be temporarily disrupted during the pandemic, the related lockdown measures, or the following economic recovery. In these circumstances some units may need to limit operations or be temporarily shut down. So far UPM has been able to protect its business continuity well.\n\n## Demand for UPM products\n\nMany of UPM's products serve essential everyday needs and have therefore seen resilient demand during the crisis. These products include pulp, specialty papers and self-adhesive label materials. However, even in these businesses, demand is influenced by general economic activity, and any re- or destocking cycles in product value chains.\n\nDemand for graphic papers is more prone to be impacted by lockdowns and economic cycles. Lockdowns limit a wide range of consumer-driven services and retail, as well as work at the office. This has had a negative impact on printed advertising and graphic paper demand during the pandemic.\n\nLockdowns and the level of economic activity may also influence demand for electricity, plywood and sawn timber.\n\n## Adjusting to different scenarios\n\nThe potential impacts on UPM are likely to differ by business and phase and waves of the pandemic, lockdown measures, changes in consumer behaviour, and the recession and recovery thereof. UPM has used shift arrangements, temporary lay-offs, or reduced working hours as required to adjust its operations in different scenarios.\n\n## Projects and maintenance shutdowns\n\nThe pandemic and the required health and safety measures add challenges to large investment projects and maintenance shutdowns. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls. Despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline and costs of such projects are possible during the pandemic, the related containment measures, or due to tight global logistics and supply chains.\n\n## Financing\n\nUPM's financial position is strong. UPM's net debt was EUR 2,374 million at the end of 2022. Net debt has been impacted by energy hedging derivative market value payments, which are driven by the increase in energy futures prices and volatility in the energy markets. Cash funds and unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 6.4 billion at the end of 2022. The total amount of committed credit facilities was EUR 5.7 billion of which EUR 4.5 billion maturing in 2024, EUR 300 million maturing in 2025 and EUR 950 million maturing in 2027. The facilities and UPM's outstanding debt have no financial covenants.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of Russia's war in Ukraine\n\nIn response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the European Union as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia, the breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk and more recently the oblasts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, and Belarus. Since 21 February 2022, these measures include for example asset freezes and travel restrictions on individuals and entities, economic sanctions targeting sectors of the Russian and Belarusian economies, and diplomatic restrictions. Russia has also implemented several countermeasures affecting especially foreign companies' operations within Russia and with Russian counterparties. Further escalation of the conflict has involved Russia's attempted illegal annexation of four partially occupied regions in Ukraine based on sham referenda, mobilisation of military reservists in Russia, issuance of open nuclear threats and explosions in Russia-to-Germany gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea, which have all increased geopolitical tensions between Russia and several other countries and triggered further sanctions packages against Russia.\n\n## Global economy\n\nWhile the sanctions primarily target Russia's ability to finance its military operations in Ukraine and cause economic and political costs on the people responsible for them, economic and geopolitical uncertainty and inflation may accelerate around the world. Import bans on various goods categories will restrict the availability of raw materials and drive cost and lead time increases in many supply chains that have been under increasing pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Export bans will impact industries dependent on Russian markets and shift delivery volumes and services to other markets. Fuel prices are exposed to geopolitical uncertainties. Because of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the sanctions imposed on the Russian energy sector and Russia's countermeasures on gas and electricity deliveries, energy price levels and volatility may increase, especially in Europe if the scope of EU sanctions expands to further fossil fuels such as natural gas.\n\n## Impact on UPM businesses\n\nThe EU has imposed export and import bans on several forest industry product categories, prohibitions on Russian transportation operators entering the EU and has sanctioned several Russian banks. Disruptions in international sales, purchases and payment flows involving Russian counterparties are inevitable. The EU has also imposed restrictions on Russian seaborne crude oil, certain petroleum products and oil transportation services and agreed in December 2022 to impose a cap of USD 60 per barrel on the price of Russian oil. Russia has also introduced legislation restricting non-Russian companies to repatriate dividends and loan payments and has caused friction in collecting customer payments from Russia. Russia has also restricted or suspended the flow of natural gas or electricity from Russia. These restrictions have impacted several European countries where UPM has production locations and caused increases in the price of power and gas. The unprecedented increase in energy futures prices has impacted cash flows from energy hedges, temporarily tying liquidity. EU energy ministers also adopted a new temporary regulation (applicable from 1 December 2022 to 30 June 2023) on the reduction of electricity use, the capping of revenues of electricity producers, and mandatory solidarity contributions from fossil fuel businesses. To implement the revenue cap of electricity producers, on 29 December 2022 the Finnish government has made a proposal for an additional profit tax on energy companies, commonly referred to as the windfall tax. The additional and temporary 30% tax would apply to Finnish electricity generating companies' profits exceeding a 10% return on adjusted shareholder's\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n122\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nequity in the fiscal year 2023. According to the proposal, group internal electricity profits would not be taken into account when calculating the taxable net profit for the temporary profit tax. The government proposal is still in the parliamentary decision-making process and the final decision is expected by the end of February 2023 at the earliest. Major forest certification organisations (i.e. FSC TM and PEFC) have also excluded Russian and Belarusian wood from their certification systems. UPM businesses have suspended deliveries to Russia as well as wood sourcing in and from Russia. UPM also decided to suspend the UPM Chudovo plywood mill operations. UPM Raflatac's Kiev terminal has been closed down since March 2022 until further notice. Due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all operating assets and uninsured receivables locating or relating to operations in these countries in Q1 2022. Impairment of fixed assets, inventories and other receivables amounting to EUR 95 million was reported as items affecting comparability. In addition, in Q1 the group increased the general provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables by EUR 17 million, which is impacting comparable EBIT. At the end of 2022, the impairment was EUR 80 million and the credit loss provision was EUR 8 million. UPM's sales to Russia and Ukraine combined was in 2022 less than 1% (2.3%) of UPM's total sales. Assets in Russia were less than 1% of the group total assets. In 2022, 3% (less than 10%) of UPM's wood sourcing to Finland originated from Russia.\n\n## Adjusting to different scenarios\n\nThe full impact of current and possible new sanctions, counter-sanctions and market development will be known only as the situation evolves. UPM has implemented mitigation plans to contain and reduce the negative consequences for its employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders as well as operations affected by sanctions and the war in Ukraine in general. The potential further impacts for UPM are likely to differ by business and by the pace, scope and duration of sanctions, market price reactions, development of supply chains, and the length of the war in Ukraine and whether any geographic escalation of the war develops. UPM is monitoring the situation closely and preparing plans to adjust its operations in different scenarios accordingly.\n\n## Key figures\n\n|                                             | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales, EURm                                 | 11,720 | 9,814  | 8,580  |\n| Comparable EBITDA, EURm                     | 2,536  | 1,821  | 1,442  |\n| % of sales                                  | 21.6   | 18.6   | 16.8   |\n| Operating profit, EURm                      | 1,974  | 1,562  | 761    |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm                       | 2,096  | 1,471  | 948    |\n| % of sales                                  | 17.9   | 15.0   | 11.1   |\n| Profit before tax, EURm                     | 1,944  | 1,548  | 737    |\n| Comparable profit before tax, EURm          | 2,066  | 1,457  | 924    |\n| Profit for the period, EURm                 | 1,556  | 1,307  | 568    |\n| Comparable profit for the period, EURm      | 1,679  | 1,204  | 737    |\n| Earnings per share (EPS), EUR               | 2.86   | 2.41   | 1.05   |\n| Comparable EPS, EUR                         | 3.09   | 2.22   | 1.37   |\n| Return on equity (ROE), %                   | 13.0   | 12.7   | 5.8    |\n| Comparable ROE, %                           | 14.0   | 11.7   | 7.5    |\n| Return on capital employed (ROE), %         | 12.8   | 12.4   | 6.7    |\n| Comparable ROCE, %                          | 13.6   | 11.7   | 8.3    |\n| Operating cash flow, EURm                   | 508    | 1,250  | 1,005  |\n| Operating cash flow per share, EUR          | 0.95   | 2.34   | 1.89   |\n| Equity per share at the end of period, EUR  | 23.44  | 20.34  | 17.53  |\n| Capital employed at the end of period, EURm | 17,913 | 13,759 | 11,555 |\n| Net debt, EURm                              | 2,374  | 647    | 56     |\n| Net debt to EBITDA                          | 0.94   | 0.35   | 0.04   |\n| Personnel at the end of period              | 17,236 | 16,966 | 18,014 |\n\n\u00bb Refer Other financial information Alternative performance measures for definitions of key figures.\n\n## Results\n\n## 2022 compared with 2021\n\nSales in 2022 were EUR 11,720 million, 19% higher than the EUR 9,814 million for 2021.

        "page_content": "## Financing and cash flow\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Personnel\n\nIn 2022 cash flow from operating activities before capital expenditure and financing totalled EUR 508 million (1,250 million). Working capital increased by EUR 687 million (115 million) mainly due to inflation and energy-related items. In 2022, particularly in June - August, the energy futures markets experienced an unprecedented rise in futures prices. Due to this, the cash outflow of UPM's unrealised energy hedges totalled EUR -0.9 billion in 2022. As UPM's energy hedges are only for hedging the existing electricity generation and energy consumption, this cash outflow will later be offset by a similar cash inflow from hedges or production. Approximately 23% of the energy hedging cash outflow during 2022 is included in the change in working capital above.\n\nNet debt was EUR 2,374 million at the end of 2022 (647 million). The gearing ratio as of 31 December 2022 was 18% (6%). The net debt to EBITDA ratio, based on the last 12 month's EBITDA, was 0.94 at the end of the period (0.35).\n\nOn 31 December 2022 UPM's cash funds and unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 6.4 billion. The total amount of committed credit facilities was EUR 5.7 billion of which EUR 4.5 billion maturing in 2024, EUR 300 million maturing in 2025 and EUR 950 million maturing in 2027.\n\nA dividend of EUR 1,30 per share (totalling EUR 693 million) was paid on 7 April 2022 for the 2021 financial year.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn 2022, capital expenditure totalled EUR 1,555 million, which was 13.3% of sales (1,483 million, 15.1% of sales). Capital expenditure does not include additions to leased assets.\n\nIn 2023, UPM's total capital expenditure, excluding investments in shares, is expected to be about EUR 950 million, which includes estimated capital expenditure of approximately EUR 750 million in transformative projects. Transformative projects consist of the new pulp mill in Uruguay and the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany.\n\nIn January 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment will be completed in Q1 2023.\n\nIn July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest in port operations in Montevideo and in local investments outside the mill fence. The mill is scheduled to start up by the end of Q1 2023, and the total investment estimate is USD 3.47 billion.\n\nIn October 2019, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 95 million in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant at the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany. The plant was connected to grid in Q3 2022. The annual cost savings of more than EUR 10 million will begin in 2023. The investment is estimated to decrease UPM's CO2 footprint by 300,000 tonnes.\n\nIn January 2020, UPM announced that it would invest in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2023, and the total investment estimate is EUR 750 million.\n\nIn December 2021, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 10 million in the development of UPM Plywood's plywood mill in Joensuu, Finland. The investment includes new production lines, new workspaces and 720 square metres of completely new production space. The investment will be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n124\n\nIn 2022, UPM had an average of 17,176 employees (17,512). At the beginning of the year the number of employees was 16,966 and at the end of 2022 it was 17,236.\n\nFurther information about personnel is available in \u00bb Our People section in UPM Annual report 2022.\n\n## Uruguay pulp mill investment\n\nOn 23 July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest USD 2.72 billion in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM would invest approximately USD 280 million in port operations in Montevideo and USD 70 million in local investments outside the mill fence, including a new residential area in Paso de los Toros. In May 2020, an electrical grid reinforcement investment of USD 70 million was added to the scope of the project to fully utilise and sell the surplus energy of the mill.\n\nThe investment will grow UPM's current pulp capacity by more than 50%, resulting in a step change in the scale of UPM's pulp business as well as in UPM's future earnings.\n\nWith a combination of competitive wood supply, scale, best available techniques and efficient logistics, the mill is expected to reach a highly competitive cash cost level of approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp. This figure includes the variable and fixed costs of plantation operations, wood sourcing, mill operations and logistics delivered to the main markets. Furthermore, the safety and sustainability performance of the value chain from plantations to customer delivery is expected to be on an industry-leading level.\n\n## Competitive wood supply\n\nEucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through UPM's own and leased plantations, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. The plantations that UPM owns, leases or manages in Uruguay cover 504,773 hectares. They will supply the current UPM Fray Bentos mill and the new mill near Paso de los Toros.\n\n## State of the art mill design\n\nThe pulp mill has been designed as an efficient single-line operation. The machines, materials, level of automation and standards enable a high operating rate and maintainability, as well as a high energy output. This ensures excellent safety, high environmental performance, and low operating costs during the long lifecycle of the mill.\n\nThe mill is designed to fully meet strict Uruguayan environmental regulations, as well as international standards and recommendations for modern mills, including the use of the latest and best available technology (BAT). The mill's environmental performance will be verified through comprehensive and transparent monitoring.\n\nThe mill's initial annual production capacity is 2.1 million tonnes, and the environmental permits enable further capacity potential. When in operation, the mill generates more than 110 MW surplus of renewable electricity.\n\n## Efficient logistics set-up\n\nAn efficient logistics chain will be secured by the agreed road improvements, extensive railway modernisation and port terminal construction.\n\nThe Public-Private-Partnership agreement between the government and the construction company for the construction of the central railway was signed in May 2019. Works on the central railway are\n\nproceeding, but the overall rail project is delayed, and the railway is scheduled to start operations in May 2023. UPM has a contingency plan in place to ensure logistics with truck transportation before the rail logistics are commissioned.\n\nUPM has completed the construction of a deep-sea pulp terminal at Montevideo port with an investment of approximately USD 240 million. Direct rail access from the mill to a modern deep-sea port terminal will create an efficient supply chain to world markets. The Montevideo deepsea port also enables synergies in ocean logistics with UPM's existing Uruguayan operations.\n\nUPM entered into a port terminal concession agreement in 2019 and signed an agreement on rail logistics services in October 2020. Both agreements are considered in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. The total amount of such lease payments is expected to be USD 200 million.\n\n## Significant impact on the Uruguayan economy\n\nBased on independent socio-economic impact studies, the mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's gross national product by about 2% and the annual value of Uruguay's exports by approximately 12% after completion.\n\nIn the most intensive construction phase, more than 7,000 people have been working on the site. In total, over 20,000 people have been involved in the various construction sites related to the project.\n\nWhen completed, approximately 10,000 permanent jobs are estimated to be created in the Uruguayan economy of which approximately 4,000 would involve direct employment by UPM and its subcontractors. About 600 companies are estimated to be working in the value chain.\n\nThe mill will be located in one of Uruguay's many free trade zones and will pay a fixed annual tax of USD 7 million. The mill's value chain is expected to contribute USD 170 million in annual taxes and social security payments and to contribute USD 200 million annually in wages and salaries.\n\n## Project schedule and capital outflow\n\nThe start-up will take place by the end of Q1 2023, and the total investment estimate is USD 3.47 billion.\n\nIn December, UPM finalised construction works at the Paso de los Toros mill site and is in its final phases of the project. The project now proceeds with the finalization of the electrical, instrumental and automation works and commissioning. The auxiliary boilers and power boilers have been commissioned. The water intake and water treatment process as well as the process air system are already in use. The recovery boiler testing has started and is advancing well, and commissioning is progressing in all process areas. As the project has entered its final phases, the number of people working on the project has significantly reduced and continues to rapidly decline.\n\nWorks at the pulp terminal in the port of Montevideo have been completed. The railway connection from the port to the Central Railroad is in progress.\n\nThe total capital expenditure of USD 3.47 billion will take place in 2019-2023, with 2021 and 2022 being the most intensive years. UPM will hold 91% ownership of the project and a local long-term partner which has also been involved in UPM Fray Bentos, owns 9%. UPM's investment will mainly be financed from operating cash flow complemented by regular group financing activities.\n\n## Biochemicals refinery investment\n\nOn 30 January 2020 UPM announced that it would invest EUR 550 million in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany. Originally, the biorefinery was scheduled to start up\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n125\n\nby the end of 2022. However, the pandemic has slowed down the completion of the detailed engineering in Leuna. Disruptions to global supply chains have affected both the availability and costs of critical construction materials. Hence the start-up schedule has been updated to take place by the end of 2023. The capital expenditure estimate has been increased to EUR 750 million.\n\nThe biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, which will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. The investment opens up totally new markets for UPM, with large growth potential for the future.\n\nThe industrial scale biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and renewable functional fillers. In addition, the biorefinery will produce biomonopropylene glycol (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. Once the facility is fully ramped up and optimised, it is expected to achieve the ROCE target of 14%.\n\nA combination of a sustainable wood supply, a unique technology concept, integration into existing infrastructure at Leuna and the proximity to customers will ensure the competitiveness of operations. The safety and sustainability of the value chain will be based on UPM's high standards.\n\nInfraLeuna GmbH, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, offers very competitive conditions for constructing a biorefinery with its logistics arrangements and infrastructure for various services and utilities. In October 2020, UPM entered into service agreements with InfraLeuna GmbH related to wood handling, wastewater treatment and other utilities, which will be recognised as lease assets and liabilities under IFRS 16 Leases upon the commencement date. The total amount of such lease assets and liabilities is estimated to be EUR 120 million.\n\nConstruction at the biorefinery-site in Leuna continues with visible progress. Major overground structures have been emerging. The erection of pipe racks, casings, tanks and the substation buildings is progressing with good speed. Also, large parts of the reactors, furnaces and columns have been delivered and are stored on site.\n\nThe business foundation has been strengthened further. Business function teams are in place and hiring the operations staff has progressed enabling entering to concrete start- and ramp-up preparations from training through process development and concrete operations planning. Also, the research and analytics laboratories are now established in Leuna and the teams are staffed and working - an important step towards quality assurance, process optimisation and to define future development options.\n\nCommercial activities have continued to proceed positively in different product and application areas. After the launch of UPM BioMotion\u2122 Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF) in October 2021, joint product development activities with potential customers in the rubber value chain have progressed further as have discussions with OEMs, especially in the automotive sector, with good results regarding both the technical and commercial viability of the product. We made further progress in taking renewable bio-monoethylene glycols (bMEG) to market, advancing sales capabilities and extending pre-commercial discussions with potential customers, as well as end-users in the packaging, textile and automotive end-uses.\n\nThe environmental benefits of the biorefinery and the UPM Biochemicals portfolio continue to be publicly acknowledged with nominations as finalist in the Packaging Europe's 'Renewables, Pre Commercialized' category and first position in the sustainability ranking in the European Rubber Journal.",

        "page_content": "## Biofuels business development\n\nIn January 2021, UPM announced that it moves forward with biofuels growth plans and starts the basic engineering phase of a next generation biorefinery. The potential biorefinery would have a maximum annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of high-quality renewable fuels including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with renewable alternatives in chemicals and bioplastics. Feedstock sourcing will focus on UPM integrated feedstocks from the company's own ecosystem and wood-based residues play a substantial role. In addition, the biorefinery would use sustainable liquid waste and residue raw materials.\n\nUPM is proceeding with a detailed commercial and basic engineering study to define the business case, select an innovative technology option and sustainable feedstock mix and estimate the investment need.\n\nThe site assessment of the potential biofuels refinery was completed in January 2022 and Rotterdam in the Netherlands has been selected as the optimal location.\n\nIf all preparations are concluded successfully, UPM would initiate the company's standard procedure of analysing and preparing an investment decision.\n\n## OL3 power plant project\n\nTeollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) is in the process of constructing a third nuclear power plant unit, OL3 EPR, at the Olkiluoto site (OL3). UPM participates in OL3 through its shareholding in Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder in TVO. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%. The OL3 plant supplier, a consortium consisting of AREVA GmbH, AREVA NP SAS and Siemens AG (Supplier), is constructing OL3 as a turnkey project.\n\n- On 12 March 2022, TVO announced that the electricity production at OL3 had started, when OL3 was connected to the national grid.  In June 2022 TVO announced that according to information received from Supplier, OL3's regular electricity production would start in December 2022. In August 2022, TVO announced that after completion of maintenance and repair activities and automation updates the test production continued with tests at a power level of 60 percent. Tests at an 80 percent power level were started on 9 September 2022. On 30 September 2022, TVO announced that the commissioning of OL3 proceeded to the full electrical power level of approximately 1,600 MW.\n- On 18 October 2022, TVO announced that damage had been detected in the internals of the feedwater pumps located in turbine island. Cracks of a few centimeters were identified in all four of OL3's feedwater pumps. A schedule estimate on an effect on the continuation of OL 3's nuclear commissioning and the start of regular electricity production is to be completed during the upcoming days.\n\nOn 7 November 2022, TVO announced that the investigations were still ongoing and it was not possible to set a date for the continuation of the test production programme. The feedwater pumps were delivered for the turbine island by a proven pump supplier that supplies pumps to several nuclear power plants.\n\nOn 21 November 2022, TVO announced that the investigation into the damage at OL 3's feedwater pumps would continue still for some weeks, and its impact on the schedule cannot be estimated. According to information TVO received from Supplier, electricity production will continue on 11 December 2022 at the earliest, and as such regular electricity production starts at the end of January 2023 at the earliest.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n126\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nOn 9 December 2022, TVO announced that the investigation into the damage in OL3's feedwater pumps proceeded into its final stages, and that according to Supplier, electricity production would continue on 25 December 2022 at the earliest. Regular electricity production would start in February 2023. According to TVO there were still uncertainties related to the schedule.\n\nOn 21 December 2022, TVO announced that the electricity production of OL3 will be continued on Tuesday, 27 December 2022. During test production, approximately 1.3 terawatt hours of electricity will be produced. Around ten significant tests still remain. Regular electricity production is to start on 8 March 2023.\n\nAfter the end of the reporting period, TVO announced on 4 January 2023 that after the production tests, production at the plant unit is discontinued in January 2023 for planned inspections of the impellers of the feedwater pumps.\n\nOn 20 January 2023, TVO announced that the impellers of OL3 feedwater pumps will be replaced with impellers with more robust measurements during the ongoing production break. After this, electricity production will continue mainly at full power. Regular electricity production starts in March 2023. Supplier is obligated to complete the plant unit in accordance with the Plant Contract and the settlement agreements.\n\nWhen completed, OL3 will supply electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle), which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to shareholders in proportion to ownership, and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nOL3 will increase UPM Energy's electricity generation capacity significantly. The new power plant unit is expected to be highly efficient and meet the highest safety standards. Its power generation will be CO2 -free and TVO will have a secure solution for the final disposal of used fuel.\n\n## Events during the reporting period\n\n- On 1 January, UPM announced that members of the Paperworkers' Union, the Finnish Electrical Workers' Union and the Trade Union Pro had started strikes at UPM mills in J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski, Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Pietarsaari, Rauma, Tampere and Valkeakoski.

This aligns the dividend policy with the company's transformative growth strategy. According to the new policy, UPM aims to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time.\n\n## Outlook for 2023\n\nUPM reached record earnings in 2022, and 2023 is expected to be another year of strong financial performance. UPM's comparable EBIT is expected to increase in H1 2023 from H1 2022.\n\nIn 2023, UPM's delivery volumes are expected to benefit from the ramp up of the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill and the OL3 nuclear power plant unit and having no strike impact when compared to 2022. In the early part of the year, however, demand for many UPM products is expected to be held back by destocking in various product value chains. The opening of the Chinese economy from the COVID lockdowns and easing inflation in other key economies represent potential for increasing demand as the year progresses.\n\nYear 2023 is starting with high cost level for many inputs, while the lower demand is exerting pressure on product prices. However, several input costs have also progressed past their peak. UPM will continue to manage margins with product pricing, by optimising its product and market mix and by taking measures to improve variable and fixed cost efficiency.\n\nThere are significant uncertainties, both positive and negative, in the outlook for 2023, related to the European, Chinese and global economy, Russia's war in Ukraine, the remaining effects of the pandemic, energy prices and related regulation in Europe, and the ramp-up of the OL3 power plant unit.",

In China, COVID-19 restrictions held back market growth. In Europe, chemical pulp demand was strong in H1. However, European demand growth was slowing down towards the end of the year due to weakening economic sentiment.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, the average European market price in euro was 32% higher for NBSK and 43% higher for BHKP, compared with 2021. In China, the average market price in US dollars was 10% higher for NBSK and 21% higher for BHKP, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 In H1 2022, demand for sawn timber was strong and market prices were at high level.

Refer to Note 1.5 in UPM 2022 consolidated financial statements.\n\n- 1) In 2022, items affecting comparability include EUR 20 million impairment charges of assets impacted by Russia's war in Ukraine, EUR 8 million gain on sale of other non-current assets, EUR 3 million settlement loss from replacement of defined benefit pension plan in Finland with defined contribution plan and EUR 2 million of AMC acquisition-related costs. In 2021, items affecting comparability relate to restructuring charges.\n\n## 2022 compared with 2021\n\nComparable EBIT for other operations decreased. The change in the fair value of forest assets net of wood harvested was EUR 2 million (120 million). The increase in the fair value of forest assets was EUR 85 million (171 million). The cost of wood harvested from UPM forests was EUR 84 million (51 million). In 2021, the increase in fair value was impacted by increased forest growth and higher stumpage price estimates used in valuation.\n\nBiofuels sales prices were significantly higher. In January-May 2022, biofuels production and deliveries were impacted by the strike and the long ramp-up of the process.\n\n## Market environment\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, market demand for advanced renewable fuels was strong and prices were at a high level.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n131\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, interest for bio-based MEG and renewable functional fillers in Europe remained strong. Strong interest in more sustainable solutions from consumers, brand-owners and automotive OEMs, is driving demand for bio-based glycols and renewable functional fillers.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, market demand for biocomposites remained firm in Europe, driven by the continued demand for sustainable products. However, delivered volumes in construction related applications decreased in H2 due to highly uncertain business environment. Market prices increased in response to input cost inflation.\n- \u00b7 In UPM Biomedicals, hydrogel demand for cell cultivation is driven by material shortages in market. Hospitals continue to explore new sustainable advanced wound care dressings.\n\n## Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on 29 March 2022, the number of members of the Board of Directors was confirmed as nine, and Henrik Ehrnrooth, Emma FitzGerald, Jari Gustafsson, Piia-Noora Kauppi, Marjan Oudeman, Martin \u00e0 Porta, Kim Wahl and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos were re-elected to the Board.

        "page_content": "Commission's press release on 12 October 2021, the Commission has concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. The Commission states that the unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in an investigation into suspected anticompetitive practices, and the fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. UPM takes any suspected violation of antitrust rules very seriously and has a compliance programme in place to mitigate the risk of such violations. For example, all employees and executives are required to take training on the UPM Code of Conduct, which includes a section regarding antitrust compliance. In addition, UPM has also in place a specific training programme regarding antitrust rules which covers approximately 3,000 employees and executives.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 9.2 Litigation , of the consolidated financial statements 2022 for information on legal proceedings.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Risk management\n\nUPM regards risk management as a systematic and proactive means to analyse and manage opportunities and threats related to its business operations. This also includes risks that can be avoided through careful planning and evaluation of future projects and business environments.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of UPM's management system as risk taking is a normal part of business operations. While executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and manufacturing units are exposed to a number of risk and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing of risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO, is responsible for recommending risk tolerances and profile to the President and CEO and the Strategy Team. The Strategy Team is responsible for aligning risk management priorities, business and risk management strategies and policies.\n\nThe Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit Committee, monitors and assesses the effectiveness of the company's risk management systems and oversees the assessment and management of risks related to the company's strategy and operations. The Audit Committee oversees that risk management activities are aligned with the Risk Management Policy, and that risk assessments are used to guide internal audit activities.\n\nUPM seeks to transfer insurable risks through insurance arrangements for any risks that exceed the defined tolerance.\n\nUPM strives to ensure compliance with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. To enhance compliance and mitigate risks, UPM performs risk assessments, training and monitoring at regular intervals.\n\nUPM has developed and implemented a comprehensive internal control system that covers business and financial reporting processes. Internal control is aimed at ensuring that the company's operations are efficient and reliable, and in compliance with statutory requirements, and that the company's financial reporting is accurate and reliable, and reflects operational results. Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is described in the Corporate Governance Statement available in the corporate website.\n\nThe main risk factors that can materially affect the company's business, financial results and non-financial performance are set out\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n132\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nbelow. They have been classified as strategic risks, operational risks, and financial risks. Risks may also arise from legal proceedings incidental to UPM's operations.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Uncertainties in the economic and political operating environment\n\nThe main short-term uncertainties in UPM's earnings relate to sales prices and delivery volumes of its products, as well as to changes in the main input cost items and currency exchange rates, most of which are affected by uncertainty in the global, regional or local economic and political conditions. Political developments are causing uncertainties to the global economy. Such uncertainties also affect UPM's customers influencing the demand for UPM's products.\n\nExamples of such developments are the trade tensions between the United States, the EU and China, the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK after its exit from the EU as well as increased geopolitical tensions that may lead to military conflicts, such as Russia's war in Ukraine, or economic sanctions, blockades, or export and/or import restrictions that could limit or prevent UPM's business in a country or area. UPM is also exposed to the impacts of certain governmental protection and trade protection measures such as foreign direct investment restrictions that safeguard domestic industries and other changes affecting international trade. Restrictions on import and export and other measures protecting national interests may affect the availability or cost of necessary raw materials, and changes in the international trade agreements. Changes in fiscal, monetary and other policies taken to respond to the economic impacts of Russia's war in Ukraine and to reduce dependency on Russian resources may cause unintended price volatility or other adverse effects on UPM. Economic downturn, global pandemics, or global power struggles continue to cause high uncertainty to global trade, geopolitics or trajectories of economies.\n\nUPM is especially exposed to the economic and political conditions in countries in which UPM has significant production operations and ongoing investment projects, such as Finland, Uruguay and Germany. UPM also has significant production operations and sales in and to China where the lack of transparency and predictability of the political, economic and legal systems may lead to an increasing uncertainty and risk level when investing in or operating in the country. UPM's subsidiaries and employees in Russia and Ukraine, while currently not operating, are exposed to challenging and unpredictable environment stemming from Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n## Cyclical and highly competitive markets\n\nIn all markets UPM operates in, the price level is determined by a combination of demand and supply and an imbalance between them could cause the prices of UPM's products to fluctuate significantly. Imbalances in demand and supply may be caused by factors such as decreases or increases in the end-use demand, changes in customer preferences, market adjustments to Russia's war in Ukraine, or a new production capacity entering the market or an old production capacity being closed, all of which may affect both the volume and price level of UPM's products.\n\nCompetitor behaviour may also influence the market price development. UPM may, from time to time, experience price pressures from competitors in its main business areas and geographic market areas as well as particularly large fluctuations in operating margins due to this competitive environment.\n\nThe majority of UPM's revenue comes from sales of graphic and specialty papers, pulp and label materials, and UPM principally\n\ncompetes with several large multinational paper and forest product companies as well as with numerous regional or more specialised competitors.\n\n## Changes in consumer behaviour\n\nDemand for UPM's products may be affected by the introduction of substitute or alternative products. The demand for graphic papers in the mature markets is forecast to continue to decline. This will likely increase the pressure on UPM's graphic paper deliveries and sales prices as well as the scarcity of recycled fibre. The COVID -19 pandemic may further amplify the speed of changes adopted by consumers in consuming and communicating information. Changes in demand could also cause overcapacity in some of UPM's products, affecting the sales prices and deliveries of such products.\n\nDepending on the product area, the shifts in consumer demand may either have a positive or an adverse effect on the consumption of UPM's products. For example, UPM expects that there will continue to be a growing need for renewable and recyclable solutions, which creates various opportunities for UPM and drive demand growth for most of UPM's products. At the same time digitalisation and e-commerce have changed consumer behaviour and resulted in decline in demand for graphic papers for various end uses.\n\n## Changes in legislation\n\nUPM is exposed to a wide range of laws and regulations globally. The performance of UPM's businesses, for example the paper, energy, and biofuels businesses, are to a high degree dependent on the regulatory framework for these areas. Changes in regulation, direct and indirect taxation or subsidies, aid, grants or allowances could have a direct effect on UPM's performance and its relative competitiveness, and structurally restrict or exacerbate UPM's ability to compete for raw material. For example, the Finnish Government has published in December 2022 a law proposal for a temporary profit tax on the Finnish electricity sector. The proposed tax would be 30% of the companies' net profits generated from the electricity operations in Finland in fiscal year 2023 exceeding 10% annual return on shareholder's equity of the electricity business. UPM Energy is the second largest electricity producer in Finland and in the scope of the proposed temporary profit tax.\n\nUPM also operates in industries that are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among others, emissions, water quality, energy efficiency, as well as waste handling, recycling and disposal. Environmental laws and regulations have become more stringent and may continue to develop to be even more stringent due to various global, regional and national level regulatory initiatives. As these environmental laws and regulations are amended or as their application or enforcement is changed, additional costs in complying with new and more stringent regulations may be imposed on UPM.\n\nUPM's operations require UPM to obtain multiple environmental permits and other licences from relevant authorities and comply with their terms and conditions. These permits and licences may be subject to modification, renewal or, subject to certain conditions, revocation by the issuing authorities. UPM monitors regulatory changes in order to better adapt to the effects of such changes.\n\n## Shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj\n\nUPM is a shareholder of Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder of Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). TVO is in the process of constructing a third nuclear power plant unit, OL3 EPR, at the Olkiluoto site (OL3). When completed, OL3 will supply electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (so called 'Mankala-principle') that is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n133\n\nprinciple, electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective Articles of Association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. OL3 is expected to increase UPM's electricity generation capacity significantly. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%.\n\nAccording to TVO OL3 was procured as a fixed price turnkey project from a consortium formed by Areva GmbH, Areva NP SAS and Siemens AG (Supplier). Under the plant contract, the consortium companies have joint and several liability for the contractual obligations.\n\nIn March 2018 TVO announced that it had signed a Global Settlement Agreement (the 2018 GSA) with Supplier and the Areva Group parent company, Areva SA, a company wholly owned by the French state. The Global Settlement Agreement, which concerns the completion of the OL3 project and related disputes and entered into force in late March 2018.According to TVO's announcement, the GSA was amended with agreements signed in June 2021.\n\nIn the GSA, the Supplier consortium companies committed to ensuring that the funds dedicated to the completion of the OL3 project are sufficient and cover all applicable guarantee periods. Consequently, a trust mechanism was set up funded by the Areva companies to secure the funds required to cover Areva's costs for the completion of the OL3 project.\n\nAccording to TVO the key matters of the amendment agreements to the GSA are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Areva companies' trust mechanism, established in the GSA of 2018, was replenished in July 2021 with EUR 432.3 million.\n- \u00b7 Both TVO and the Supplier are to cover their own costs as of July 2021 until end of February 2022.\n- \u00b7 In the case that the Supplier consortium companies would not complete the OL3 project by the end of February 2022, they would pay additional compensation for delays, depending on the date of completion.\n- \u00b7 In connection with the amendment of GSA entering into force, the Supplier paid EUR 206.9 million of the EUR 400.0 million delay compensation as agreed in the GSA 2018.\n\nDue to OL3 additional delay in 2022 in interim report Q3 2022 TVO announced that TVO had recorded receivables from the Supplier for the additional delay compensation accumulated by the end of Q3 2022 in accordance with the amended GSA. The additional delay compensation has been recorded as EUR 56.7 million at the end of Q3 2022. At the end of Q3 2022, TVO has recognised current receivables of EUR 249.8 million from the Supplier.\n\nAccording to TVO, all payments related to the settlement compensations have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.\n\nTVO announced in its interim report Q3 2022 that the trust, which was replenished in July 2021, has been used to cover costs incurred to Areva companies for the completion of the OL3 project in accordance with the GSA. Also, TVO mentioned, that TVO's right to terminate the plant contract in accordance with the GSA was postponed until 31 March 2023. In addition, the payment of approximately EUR 193 million of the delay compensation agreed in the GSA of 2018 was postponed until the completion of OL3, up to 31 March 2023 at the latest.\n\nOn 12 March 2022, TVO announced that the electricity production at OL3 had started, when OL3 was connected to the national grid.  In June 2022 TVO announced that according to information received from Supplier, OL3's regular electricity production would start in December 2022. In August 2022, TVO announced that after completion of",

        "page_content": "maintenance and repair activities and automation updates the test production continued with tests at a power level of 60 percent. Tests at an 80 percent power level were started on 9 September 2022. On 30 September 2022, TVO announced that the commissioning of OL3 proceeded to the full electrical power level of approximately 1,600 MW.\n\nOn 18 October 2022, TVO announced that damage had been detected in the internals of the feedwater pumps located in turbine island. Cracks of a few centimeters were identified in all four of OL3's feedwater pumps. A schedule estimate on an effect on the continuation of OL 3's nuclear commissioning and the start of regular electricity production is to be completed during the upcoming days.\n\nOn 7 November 2022, TVO announced that the investigations were still ongoing, and it was not possible to set a date for the continuation of the test production programme. The feedwater pumps were delivered for the turbine island by a proven pump supplier that supplies pumps to several nuclear power plants.\n\nOn 21 November 2022, TVO announced that the investigation into the damage at OL 3's feedwater pumps would continue still for some weeks, and its impact on the schedule cannot be estimated. According to information TVO received from the Supplier, electricity production will continue on 11 December 2022 at the earliest, and as such regular electricity production starts at the end of January 2023 at the earliest.\n\nOn 9 December 2022, TVO announced that the investigation into the damage in OL3's feedwater pumps proceeded into its final stages, and that according to the Supplier, electricity production would continue on 25 December 2022 at the earliest. Regular electricity production would start in February 2023. According to TVO there were still uncertainties related to the schedule.\n\nOn 21 December 2022, TVO announced that the electricity production of OL3 will be continued on Tuesday, 27 December 2022. During test production, approximately 1.3 terawatt hours of electricity will be produced. Around ten significant tests still remain. Regular electricity production is to start on 8 March 2023.\n\nAfter the end of the reporting period, TVO announced on 4 January 2023 that after the production tests, production at the plant unit is discontinued in January 2023 for planned inspections of the impellers of the feedwater pumps.\n\nOn 20 January 2023, TVO announced that the impellers of OL3 feedwater pumps will be replaced with impellers with more robust measurements during the ongoing production break. After this, electricity production will continue mainly at full power. Regular electricity production starts in March 2023. The Supplier is obligated to complete the OL3 plant unit in accordance with the Plant Contract and the settlement agreements.\n\nTVO announced in its Q3 2022 Interim Report that according to the Supplier's latest project schedule, TVO's current cost estimate, and the effects of the GSA, TVO estimates that its total investment in the OL3 project will be approximately EUR 5.8 (5.7) billion.\n\nAlso, in Q3 2022 Interim Report TVO presented that as the OL3 project is still ongoing, no assurance can be given that further delays would not materialise prior completion of the project. According to TVO a failure by one or more of the Supplier to meet their respective obligations according to the Plant Contract or the Global Settlement Agreement may subject to new legal proceedings or new negotiations with the Supplier which have joint and several liability. In addition, TVO said that restrictions caused by the main grid may have an impact on OL3's electricity production.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 TVO announced, that the shareholders of TVO, including PVO, had signed an additional shareholder loan commitment, comprising a total of EUR 400 million new subordinated shareholder loan agreements. According to TVO with the new\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n134\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nshareholder loan commitment, TVO is preparing to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer and equity ratio to complete OL3. On 30 November 2022, TVO announced that the shareholder loan commitment of EUR 400 million, originally agreed in December 2020, has been extended by one year until the end of 2023.\n\nOn 21 March 2022, TVO announced that S&P Global Ratings upgraded its long-term credit rating from 'BB' to 'BB+' and affirmed its positive outlook.\n\nFurther delays to the OL3 project could have an adverse impact on PVO's business and financial position, the fair value of UPM's energy shareholdings in PVO and/or the cost of energy sourced from OL3, when completed. It is possible that the cost of energy sourced from OL3 at the time when it starts regular electricity production may be higher than the market price of electricity at that time.\n\n## Climate change\n\nUPM is exposed to a variety of risks related to climate change. Strategic risks related to climate change include risks concerning competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation, subsidies or EU policies and resulting national legislation in EU countries may distort raw material, energy and final product markets and changing costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM's financial performance. Policies and regulations responding to Russia's war in Ukraine and cutting Russian gas supply to Europe may temporarily emphasize energy supply security over climate targets and thus change the trajectory of climate change or slow down the achievement of emission reductions. UPM believes that forest, woodbased products and low-carbon energy hold significant value creation potential with respect to renewable and recyclable products.\n\nOther risks related to climate change particularly concern UPM's supply chain as well as the availability and price of major inputs, such as wood and electricity. Climate change may cause exceptional weather events, such as severe storms, floods and draughts, which could, for example, result in unpredictable hydropower availability and wood harvesting conditions. Exceptionally mild winter conditions with a reduced period of frozen soil in the Nordics could affect the harvesting and transport of wood, consequently undermining the stability of raw material supply and potentially increasing the cost of wood. These could also increase the risk of production limitations.\n\n## Loss of major customers and industry consolidation\n\nUPM has several major customers, and the largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 3% of UPM's sales in 2022, and the ten largest customers represented approximately 15% of such sales. Although UPM is not dependent on any specific customer or group of customers, the loss of its major customers, if not replaced on similar terms, could have a material effect on UPM's business. Also, as the size of UPM's customers could increase in connection with industry consolidation, such customers could exert increased bargaining power on all of their suppliers, including UPM. UPM is also exposed to risks related to any deterioration of a major customer group's financial condition.\n\n## Product development, innovation and intellectual property rights\n\nResearch and product development are an important part of UPM's strategy, particularly with regard to new businesses, such as woodbased biofuels, biochemicals and biomedicals. The return on investment of new or enhanced existing products and solutions may not meet targets or improve UPM's competitiveness.\n\nUPM has a broad patent portfolio that provides value creation potential in the future; however, it also exposes UPM to risks related to the protection and management of intellectual property, including patents and trademarks.\n\n## Corporate acquisitions and divestments\n\nUPM's strategy is to grow businesses with strong long-term fundamentals and sustainable competitive advantage. This may result in acquisitions of new businesses or divestments of existing businesses or parts thereof. Carrying out corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestments involves risks relating to the successful implementation of a divestment and the ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses, systems, culture and personnel successfully. In addition, the cost of an acquisition may prove high and/or the anticipated economies of scale or synergies may not materialise. Hidden liabilities of an acquired company (e.g., competition law liabilities) may also constitute a significant risk in relation to potential acquisitions.\n\nUPM may divest operations or assets to focus on strategic areas. Any future divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond UPM's control, such as the availability of financing to potential buyers, interest rates, acquirers' capacity, and regulatory approval processes, and divestments may also expose UPM to indemnity claims. Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. The profitability of corporate acquisitions and divestments may differ from UPM's expectations.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Fluctuations in the prices of major inputs as well as changes in their availability\n\nThe main inputs required in the manufacturing of UPM's products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these major production inputs have been volatile in the recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, which may have an effect on the general profitability of the industries in which UPM operates. Climate change may contribute to the increase of the price volatility of UPM's major production inputs. Also, any changes in the current forestry practices and level of harvesting due to negative public opinion towards harvesting could have an effect on the raw material supply and may increase the cost of wood.\n\nGovernmental protection and trade protection measures, amplified by Russia's war in Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed as a response, could also have an effect on the price and availability of raw materials as countries may, for example, enact further export ban policies to protect forests or to bolster their domestic industries, which could have a material effect on the cost and availability of raw materials for UPM. It is also uncertain how the EU energy policies may affect the availability and costs of fibre and energy. Significant increases in the prices of UPM's major inputs could increase UPM's operating expenses.\n\n## Supplier and subcontractor network and raw materials procurement\n\nUPM's business operations depend on a large number of suppliers and contractors. The majority of UPM's need of wood is covered by suppliers, and other production inputs, such as chemicals, fillers and recovered paper, are fully obtained from suppliers. Disruptions in the supply of key inputs or transportation services could have a significant effect on manufacturing operations. This could, for example, result in interruption or downscaling of production, change in the product mix or increased costs resulting from price increases for critical inputs or transportation services as well as shifts in the availability and price of wood. Due to Russia's war in Ukraine, the EU has imposed bans on wood exports and imports and transportation operations directly applying to sourcing of wood and other raw materials from Russia. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n135\n\nwhich UPM would be able to source its production inputs and could materially affect the prices paid by UPM for these inputs.\n\nThe UPM Supplier and Third Party Code defines the minimum level of performance that UPM requires from its suppliers and third-party intermediaries. UPM carries out supplier risk assessments on, for example, operational, financial, quality and responsibility perspectives. Based on the risk assessment, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through annual surveys, supplier audits and joint development plans. If any non-conformities are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective measures, which UPM follows up on. Some contracts may also be discontinued due to the seriousness of the finding or insufficient corrective measures.\n\n## Management and execution of large investment projects\n\nInvestment projects in UPM's businesses are often large and take one or more years to complete. Participation in large projects involves risks, such as cost overruns or delays, shortage of labour, financial distress of suppliers, or accidents as well as non-achievement of the economic targets set for the investment. Currently, UPM's largest ongoing investment project is the construction of a new world-class pulp mill in Uruguay, which includes other related investments as well (port, Free Trade Zone infra and housing). Particular to this project is its size, complexity with a number of interconnected sub-projects as well as the level of cooperation with permit and other authorities. Additionally, the second largest ongoing project is the construction of a biochemicals refinery in Germany. This project involves the development of new business concepts and technologies.\n\nUPM is responsible for many projects in several of its countries of operation at any given time. All projects involve technical and operational risks, and projects require continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Managing several projects requires that UPM has sufficient resources and efficient processes. Port congestion issues, transportation bottlenecks, accidents in transit, and rising logistics costs, all of which could be resulting from external events or market conditions beyond the control of UPM, may have an effect on the execution or profitability of investment projects. The COVID -19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures have also added a new challenge to large investment projects. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls, but despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline of the projects may occur due to containment measures or infections affecting project workers, suppliers or infrastructure.\n\n## Unavailability of information systems as well as cybersecurity breaches\n\nUPM's production and business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in UPM's or a supplier's critical information system services, loss of critical, financial or personal data due to reasons beyond UPM's or its suppliers' control, such as power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or other major disasters, such as fires or natural disasters, as well as user errors by UPM's own personnel or suppliers, can potentially cause major damage to UPM's businesses and disruptions to the continuity of operations.\n\nUPM's or its suppliers' information systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks. Malicious cyber intrusion could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages and damage to UPM's reputation.",

        "page_content": "## Litigation and compliance\n\nUPM operates globally in a large number of jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks. UPM may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings or it could become subject to various claims and actions based on various grounds.\n\nOn a global scale, enforcement activities and jurisdictional reach regarding competition issues and anti-corruption have increased. Also, the recent development of Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) related lawsuits in Germany for alleged non-payment of EEG based surcharges may have an adverse impact on UPM, albeit UPM is not currently a party to any such lawsuits. Russia's war in Ukraine triggered many countries to impose several sanctions packages which may increase the risk of investigations, litigations or claims associated with alleged sanctions violations, or retaliatory litigation in Russia. The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards of responsible behaviour and it covers topics relating to legal compliance and disclosure, anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM's environmental performance and social responsibility play a significant role in UPM's ability to operate and influence the long-term success of its businesses. UPM also measures and publishes information on its environmental, social and governance matters, for which there is an increasing risk of investigation or litigation from activist or other stakeholders on alleged misrepresentation. UPM has significant manufacturing operations or sourcing in several developing countries, some of which are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval. Breaches of applicable laws and regulations or corporate policies by UPM employees may lead to legal processes, sanctions and fines as well as reputational damages effecting UPM's operations. For example, In October 2021 the European Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at UPM's premises. According to the Commission's press release on 12th October 2021, the Commission has concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. Commission states that the unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in an investigation into suspected anticompetitive practises, and the fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. UPM continues to support the Commission with any investigation activity that may follow.\n\n## Industrial actions\n\nUPM is subject to risk of industrial actions, which could disrupt its business operations or the business operations of its stakeholders. Uncertainty may increase in the Finnish labour market amid the announcement of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation in fall 2020 to transfer collective bargaining to companies. For example, in the beginning of 2022, members of the Paperworkers' Union, the Finnish Electrical Workers' Union and the Trade Union Pro started strikes at UPM mills in J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski, Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Pietarsaari, Rauma, Tampere and Valkeakoski, Finland. Any strike or other industrial action in UPM's business operations or related sectors could have an effect on UPM's business operations. For example, industrial actions in the transport sector or among other stakeholders important to UPM, may disrupt UPM's operations. Additionally, public dissatisfaction with UPM's labour-related decisions may, in extreme cases, lead to unanticipated boycotts or disruptions at its facilities or construction sites.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n136\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## A natural disaster, fire, accident or other calamity at UPM's production facilities\n\nUPM operates a significant number of production facilities globally that are exposed to risks related to environment, fires, natural events, machinery breakdowns, site security and occupational health and safety risks. If UPM's production facilities were to experience a major accident or were forced to shut down or curtail production due to such unforeseen events, such as a leak or spill due to malfunction or human error, this could cause major interruptions in UPM's operations and result in significant costs in order to clean up and repair any potential damages to the production plant and the surrounding areas. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness (such as a COVID -19 infection) or liability to UPM's employees, contractors or third parties. These risks are managed through established management procedures, health and safety precautions and loss prevention programmes. UPM's insurance programme provides coverage for insurable hazard risks, subject to insurance terms and conditions.\n\n## Forests and plantations\n\nUPM's plantations and forests may be affected by the impacts of climate change, which include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, storms, floods and drought. Climate change is expected to have the biggest physical effect on UPM's forest lands in Finland, where temperatures are expected to rise more significantly and rapidly compared with other countries where UPM owns forest. Although forest growth will likely accelerate, particularly in Finland, due to the longer growing season, extreme weather conditions will intensify, presenting new risks. The increase of droughts and forest fires are estimated to pose the most significant risks for UPM's forests and plantations. Also, damages caused by insects and tree diseases are becoming increasingly common, which could have an effect on the value of UPM's forest assets. Should these risks materialise, they could harm UPM's forest and plantations resulting in production interruption and additional costs.\n\n## Strategic partners\n\nUPM collaborates with many partners. For example, product development in the biofuels, bioenergy or biochemicals increases the importance of partnerships in the search for new products and businesses or higher efficiency. Partnerships may, however, create risks to UPM's profitability, for example, through changes occurring within the partner entity or changes in how the partnership operates. UPM is also subject to the risk that its strategic partners do not comply with UPM's Code of Conduct with anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nPartnership arrangements may also be too rigid to enable timely changes required, for example, in connection with changes in the market conditions or the economy. UPM's partners may have different targets with respect to the business of the partnerships. As UPM may not have sole control over strategic direction and operational output of these entities, its partners may have the right to make certain decisions on key business matters with which UPM does not agree. In some cases, strategic partners may choose not to continue partnerships that they have with UPM. Russia's war in Ukraine and the resulting adverse economic conditions may cause financial stress to a strategic partner and trigger unexpected negotiation or other processes causing delays or cost increases for UPM.\n\n## Intellectual property rights of third parties\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Initiatives within this strategic focus area are technologyintensive and require increasing investments in such technologies either through internal development or through third party licences or technological partnerships. In addition to UPM's own IPR portfolio, UPM licences certain technologies developed by third parties. Evaluating the rights related to the third party technologies UPM uses or intends to use is increasingly challenging. Licensing third party technology exposes UPM to such risks as the increase of overall licensing costs, loss of negotiation power, the validity of such licensing arrangements and potential infringement claims, which could restrict UPM's ability to use certain technologies, prevent the delivery of UPM's products and/or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Risk related to IPR claims and disputes relating to technological partnerships have been assessed to increase.\n\n## Building capabilities to growth areas\n\nThe success of UPM's business largely depends on the ability to build and retain the necessary new capabilities required for future growth. UPM is continuously developing its employee experience, leadership culture, evaluating its recruitment, compensation policies and career development opportunities and taking measures to attract and retain diversely skilled personnel and individuals with rare and pivotal specialist knowledge for current and future growth areas.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks are described in consolidated financial statements 2022.\n\n| TYPE OF RISK                   | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENT NOTE   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                      |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management                   |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Counterparty risk              | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting     |\n\n## Non-financial information\n\nGlobal megatrends represent many long-term opportunities and challenges for UPM towards 2030 and beyond. They are also driving demand for sustainable solutions and responsible business practices.\n\nTo steer its responsibility activities, UPM has established a set of responsibility focus areas with targets and key performance indicators. They are reviewed every year based on a materiality analysis (page 62). The focus areas cover economic, social and environmental responsibility. Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is becoming more important all the time, and it is relevant for UPM throughout the whole value chain: land use, sourcing, production and products. Thus, climate-related targets have been established for all of these areas. In 2022, the importance of biodiversity was reflected in UPM's broader approach towards biodiversity and establishing it as an own area of focus.\n\nUPM's Biofore strategy guides the company in achieving its responsibility targets for 2030 and in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development published by the UN.\n\nConnecting sustainability performance to financing demonstrates the importance of responsible business practices to UPM's long term value creation. UPM's revolving credit facility is linked to the long-term\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n137\n\nbiodiversity and climate targets, and three green bonds have been issued since 2020. Since January 2022, responsibility-related measures have been included in UPM's management remuneration.\n\n## Based on international frameworks and commitments\n\nUPM respects international human rights agreements and agreements concerning labour rights, including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSince 2003, UPM is a signatory of the UN Global Compact initiative, whose ten universal principles are derived from international agreements in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. In 2022, UPM joined the UN Global Compact's Living Wage Think Lab.\n\nRegarding climate change UPM committed to the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative in 2017 and received validation of its tightened CO2 targets in 2020. To further strengthen its climate approach, UPM committed to the UN's Business Ambition for the 1.5\u00b0C pledge and joined The Climate Pledge to reach the targets set by the Paris Agreement by 2040.\n\nUPM follows the Finnish Corporate Governance Code issued by the Securities Market Association and complies with all of its recommendations.\n\n## UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies\n\nUPM's decision making, management and operations are guided by UPM values and the UPM Code of Conduct. Legal compliance and responsible practices are the foundation of all of UPM's businesses and create long-term value for both UPM and its stakeholders. The UPM Code of Conduct emphasises UPM's commitment to business integrity and responsible business operations, manifesting the company's guiding principles.\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct is approved by the Board of Directors as UPM's highest governance body. It is complemented by more detailed policies approved by the Board of Directors and rules or statements approved by the Group Executive Team, business areas or global functions. These policies, rules and statements cover such topics as treasury, taxes, disclosures, insider matters, anti-corruption, competition law, confidentiality, human resources, responsibility, forestry, information security and data protection, and safety.\n\nUPM expects its suppliers, third party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct and to fulfil criteria concerning social and environmental responsibility. These requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code, latest updates effective as of beginning of 2020. The UPM Code of Conduct was last updated in 2022.\n\n## Roles of the group management and functions in leading nonfinancial matters\n\nThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is responsible for monitoring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. The non-financial information in this Report of the Board of Directors is reviewed by the Board as part of the approval process. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees procedures for treatment of complaints and concerns received by the company, anonymous or otherwise. As part of the committee's compliance review, the committee is provided with a quarterly report by the company's Chief Compliance Officer, and a report of submissions under the company's Report Misconduct channel by the Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved strategic plans during its strategy session in May 2022. The main focus areas of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be",

        "page_content": "performance, growth, innovation, responsibility and portfolio development. This strategy is enhanced by the UPM purpose: We create a future beyond fossils (read more on pages 20-21). An essential part of the Board's annual strategy work is to review and assess strategic and operational risks and opportunities (see UPM Corporate Governance Statement 2022). These risks and opportunities and their impact on operations and strategy are described on pages 32-33.\n\nIn 2022, the Board decided to set measures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes in the Company's performance share plan (PSP), one of its long-term incentive plans. They decided to set three distinct ESG performance measures and the total weighting of these measures accounts for 20% of all measures.\n\nThe Group Executive Team, headed by the President and CEO, is responsible for the management of corporate responsibility, including possible impacts on economy, environment and people, determining courses of action and guiding development work. In practice, corporate responsibility work takes place in businesses and functions, and in the group's Responsibility team, which co-ordinates the projects carried out by businesses and functions.\n\nUPM Legal Function and its Compliance team manage legal compliance programmes and arrange related training at regular intervals for specific target groups, which have been defined based on risk assessments. UPM Sourcing organisations follow clearly defined selection and follow-up processes when evaluating suppliers. Reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, financial sustainability of suppliers, social and environmental responsibility and product safety are the key factors when selecting and evaluating suppliers.\n\nWhile executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and production units are exposed to a number of financial and nonfinancial risks and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management Function.\n\n## Management of non-financial matters\n\nUPM's responsible thinking starts with anticipating, mitigating and managing risks, and extends to creating a competitive advantage and long-term value.\n\nUPM continually strives to reduce its risk exposure and improve its performance by using tools such as certified management systems. Since 2018, all production sites have a certified ISO 14001 environmental management system. Nearly all production sites and wood sourcing operations implemented integrated management systems for environmental protection, quality management and occupational health and safety in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standards. All pulp and paper mills in the EU, as well as the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay and the UPM Changshu paper mill in China, also adhere to the EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Many of the sites also have energy management systems certified under ISO 50001 or the Finnish ETJ+ system, and food safety management systems certified under ISO 22000, if relevant.\n\nShould stakeholders have any concerns or suspect misconduct, they are encouraged to contact UPM or to use the UPM Report Misconduct channel. The service is available on the corporate website for both the company's employees and external stakeholders. Operated by an independent external service provider, the channel is accessible in over 40 languages, 24/7. In 2022, 54 (66) cases were reported either through the UPM Report Misconduct channel or directly to Internal Audit or the Compliance team. 9 (9) of these cases related to alleged discrimination or harassment. 8 (18) cases led to disciplinary action including warnings and terminations of employment.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n138\n\n## Reporting framework used\n\nFor its Group-level sustainability reporting UPM follows the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as the AA 1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard. The respective information is assured by an independent third-party, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Oy (pages 116-117).\n\n## Committed to anti-corruption\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct underlines the company's zero tolerance attitude towards corruption and bribery in any form. UPM AntiCorruption Rules explain prohibited conduct and expected ethical behaviour in further detail.\n\nUPM performs anti-corruption risk assessment on a regular basis. The annual risk-assessment process includes a top-down risk discussion with the management of each business area. All UPM group entities are also assessed on the basis of country risk and complexity of operations. UPM operates globally and has significant manufacturing operations in several emerging market countries. Such operations require a number of permits and other licenses from the relevant authorities. Some of the countries where UPM operates are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval.\n\nDue diligence of suppliers and third parties with whom UPM does business is an essential part of UPM's anti-corruption compliance programme. UPM requires that due diligence is performed before entering into or renewing any contract with a third party that meets specified criteria. UPM requires anti-bribery contract terms to be included in agreements with such third parties outlining the third party's commitment to compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and UPM's right to audit the third party to verify compliance with these terms. UPM also has corresponding due diligence procedures for joint ventures, including mergers and acquisitions.\n\nUPM has a dedicated anti-corruption e-learning platform. The anticorruption training covers all white-collar employees. In 2022, the company organised tailored anti-corruption training workshops for selected target groups across the company and performed risk-based compliance reviews in selected jurisdictions and operations.\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\nUPM is committed to respecting and promoting human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. UPM has assessed all its operations and activities and has identified the potential human rights issues and impacts. When considering both the severity and likelihood of these potential issues and impacts, UPM considers the salient human rights issues in the company's sphere of influence to be environmental pollution, occupational health and safety (OHS), working conditions, protection of children, and forced labour.\n\nUPM reviews its human rights risks as part of the UPM compliance process quarterly. The assessment of salient human rights issues on a business area level as well as the integration of the process to unit specific management systems continued. The focus was on catching up with the developments in our business landscape and operational environments and on identifying any gaps in our mitigation activities. As a result of the 2022 assessments, contractor management was selected as one of the focus areas going forward. UPM also continued to publish a report of UPM's Human Rights Responsibility.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nUPM requires its suppliers, third-party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct including commitment to anti-corruption, environmental and social responsibility, safe products, human rights and occupational health and safety practices.\n\nTransparent supplier requirements are the basis for responsible sourcing. These requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code. A number of additional requirements are in place for the sourcing of wood, chemicals, pulp and packaging materials, as well as for safety and logistics. All contractors working on site go through UPM's safety requirements and a web-based safety induction training.\n\nUPM identifies its supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. These responsibility-related high risk suppliers are determined by the country of origin, sourced material or service, and the UPM supply chain ESG risk register which holds UPM's view on company and business area relevant risks on people and the environment. UPM also uses EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans to carry out more detailed evaluations of suppliers' activities.\n\nIn 2022, UPM updated its supplier assessment criteria and supplier audit questionnaire, and also started a renewal of its Responsible Sourcing Framework with the aim of improving supply chain resilience and risk management.\n\nUPM continued its co-operation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that promotes and improves sustainability practices within the supply chains. In 2022, UPM conducted some 520 (340) EcoVadis environmental and social risk assessments and 121 (124) supplier audits. In addition, about 360 (300) contractor reviews with a focus on working conditions were carried out.\n\n## Social and employee-related matters\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in social and employee-related matters are: learning and development, responsible leadership, diversity and inclusion, fair rewarding as well as safe and healthy working environment.\n\nUPM is committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. After the Finnish Forest Industries Federation resigned from collective bargaining, the terms of employment are agreed between forest products companies and trade unions. UPM has agreed businessspecific collective labour agreements in Finland (page 67).\n\nUPM aims to empower and engage employees at all levels through responsible leadership. UPM encourages its employees to pursue professional growth, expects development and supports them in learning skills and developing them further.\n\nUPM respects the privacy of employees and promotes equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development. All UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, etc. In 2022, UPM implemented gender pay equity review process closing the unexplained gender pay gap and carried out a living wage review process to make sure that salaries are sufficient everywhere. Greater female representation in professional and managerial roles has been in focus for different organisations.\n\nIn its People Strategy, UPM focused on leadership and creating a safe, inclusive and diverse working environment, as well as aiming higher in performance and ensuring the growth of our people. The aim is to create a unique, positive UPM experience and to develop future ways of working and collaborating, supported by attractive culture, space and technology. In 2022, UPM continued with its programme to develop the UPM experience and ways of working. The enabling\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n139\n\nperformance approach by strengthening feedback culture, agile goal setting and frequent manager-employee discussions is being further strengthened. Development programmes to support growth and performance were continued and implemented virtually. To further develop inclusive leadership and culture, UPM continued to train leaders and launched a digital learning to all UPMers on LGBTIQ+ inclusion in workplace.\n\nUPM promotes employees' health and wellbeing. Safety is an essential part of UPM's activities and business management system. Equal safety requirements are applied to all employees, visitors and contractors working at UPM's premises. Proactively thinking about the safety of employees and contractors remained an important focus area in 2022. The safety and wellbeing of our employees during the global pandemic has been the key priority. The requirements concerning process safety have been clarified with a new safety standard and process safety has been in focus especially in the new investment projects of the biofuel and biochemicals businesses.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nThe majority of UPM's products are made from renewable raw materials and are recyclable. UPM products help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based products with bio-based renewable alternatives. Product stewardship covers the entire lifecycle of all UPM products from the development phase to the end-use and beyond.\n\nIn 2022, the new Sustainable Product Design concept was further tested on several product development cases with UPM businesses. The approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both of which are integrated in sustainable product design practices. During the process, the whole raw material chain, production and distribution efficiency, sustainable use and circularity are considered.\n\nUPM provides product declarations to provide customers with easy access to information concerning the products'environmental and product safety aspects or the wood origin. Together with a number of paper and chemical companies the exchange of information in the supply chain was improved. This facilitated a pre-assessment of chemical use and to ensured compliance with legislations and ecolabels.\n\nMost UPM products are certified with widely recognised ecolabels, such as the EU ecolabel and national ecolabels for graphic paper or ISCC and RSB certification for biofuels, biocomposites and labels.\n\nAll UPM pulp mills, UPM Raflatac sites, UPM Specialty Papers' production lines and UPM Kymi paper mill have implemented food management systems in accordance with ISO 22000. The respective products are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\nIn 2022, we modernised our chemical database to improve access to advanced reporting and control features.",

        "page_content": "## Environment\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in environmental matters are forests, biodiversity, water, waste and climate. UPM uses raw materials, water, energy and other resources in a responsible manner and continuously improves its energy, resource and cost efficiency.\n\nUPM is committed to sustainable forestry and third-party-verified FSC\u2122 and PEFC chain of custody certification covers all sites using wood raw materials. This ensures that the wood is legally sourced from sustainably managed forests. All UPM-owned forests are certified, or in the process of certification if acquired recently.\n\nUPM is continuously working to improve biodiversity in its forests. Since 2022, biodiversity-related activities in Finland, Uruguay and the U.S. have been incorporated in UPM's new Forest Action programme. The new programme covers not only biodiversity and climate but also sustainability criteria related to water, soil and social aspects. In 2022, the importance of biodiversity was also reflected in UPM's broader approach towards biodiversity to also cover other areas beside forests, e. g. streams and mill sites, and in establishing it as an own focus area.\n\nAll of UPM's production plants are located in areas with low and medium basin risk where there is sufficient water available. A comprehensive water risk analysis has provided 2030 and 2050 scenarios of water risks, based on climate and socio-economic changes to enable us to understand and prepare for future water risks and opportunities. The water used by UPM plants comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater resources. UPM uses water responsibly in terms of the company's water usage and effluent quality. If the price of raw water were to increase by EUR 0.01 per cubic metre, it would mean additional water costs of approximately EUR 4 million annually. In 2022, wastewater volume increased by 3% per tonne of paper and by 15% per tonne of pulp. As Finnish pulp and paper mills went on strike in early 2022, effluent treatment plants had to be kept in operation with low capacity while production was ceased, leading to an increase of wastewater volume per tonne of product.\n\nCircular bioeconomy is at the core of our operations. We have developed innovative ways to reduce and recover waste and to use side streams, residues and recovered materials. For example, tall oil is used for the production of UPM BioVerno renewable diesel and naphtha and ash is utilised in soil stabilisation, cement industry or as raw material for paper filler production. Regulatory changes may have an impact on the options for waste or residue use, either by restricting the end uses and thus causing higher costs for alternative solutions, or by creating new opportunities. In 2022, 90 (89)% of UPM's process waste was recycled or recovered, of which 21 (21)% is energy recovery.\n\nIn 2022, UPM's environmental investments totalled EUR 11 million (5 million). The largest investment was for the improvement of one fibre line's brown stock washing at UPM Kaukas pulp mill to reduce the COD load of wastewater. UPM's environmental costs, which were mainly attributable to effluent treatment and waste management, totalled EUR 123 million (111 million), including depreciation.\n\nThe company-wide Clean Run concept, launched in 2012, aims to improve UPM's environmental performance by bringing environmental issues to the forefront of everyday work. All sites systematically follow up any deviations, proactively report observations and near misses, carry out walks and discussions, and compile detailed risk assessments. Approximately 1,400 (1,400) environmental walks were organised and 2,100 (2,500) preventive environmental observations and near misses were reported in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the number of environmental non-conformances decreased by 3 to a total of 22 (25) deviations from permit, contractual or other\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n140\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nobligations. 10 cases were related to air, 9 to water, 2 to soil and 1 to noise. All deviations were reported to the authorities and, where relevant, to local stakeholders. Appropriate measures were taken to normalise the situation, and will be taken to prevent similar occurrences. No major environmental incidents occurred at UPM production plants in 2022 and UPM was not required to pay any significant fines due to environmental non-conformances.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe management of climate change related issues is integrated into the management of other non-financial issues and is reported to the Board depending on the context and matter. For example: 1) risks are reported to the Board by CFO, 2) related compliance and regulatory issues are briefed quarterly to the Audit Committee (Board) by the Compliance Officer, 3) annual progress on 2030 responsibility targets is reported by EVP Stakeholder Relations or 4) if there are specific climate-related topics, then the responsible topic owner briefs the Board. Additionally, major climate-related issues such as scenario analyses, commitments and UPM's overall approach of acting through forests, emission reductions in production and supply chain and through climatepositive products are reported directly to UPM management bodies led by CEO.\n\nUPM's position and resilience in different climate scenarios (IPCC RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, IEA B2DS, IEA NPS and IEA CPS) have been evaluated for the businesses and functions from both physical and transitional angles, involving expertise from scientific community. Generally, in low- and medium-emission scenarios the transition impacts play a bigger role and UPM is well positioned as its business portfolio allows for flexibility regarding recognised risks and opportunities. In the high-emission scenario physical impacts dominate with severe consequences not only for UPM but for the ecosystems and societies across the globe.\n\nUPM's main target related to climate change is reducing fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 65% from 2015 levels by 2030. This target was validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative to be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0 C pathway according to the Paris agreement. In 2022, fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) summed up to 4.5 (5.0) million tonnes, which is a decrease of 11% compared to 2021.\n\nFurther targets related to climate change are reducing fossil CO2 emissions from supply chain (Scope 3) by 30% from 2018 levels by 2030, climate-positive land use and developing climate-positive product portfolio. Concerning land use, forestry and product portfolio, UPM has engaged with scientific partners in order to gain credible data and approaches.\n\nUPM favours the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. Biomass-based fuels make up 65% (70%) of fuels used by UPM worldwide. If UPM needed to buy certificates to cover its whole direct fossil CO2 emissions, and if the price of CO2 certificates were to rise by EUR 10 per tonne, it would mean additional costs of approximately EUR 23 million annually.\n\nIn 2022, UPM finalised a study on climate-related substitution and carbon storage effects of our products with the Finnish SYKE and the German IFEU institutes and we joined the pilot testing phase of the GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance. This development work will help defining UPM's approach for net-zero emissions\n\n## UPM climate related disclosures according to TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) are

In 2021, the European Commission adopted the related EU Disclosures Delegated Act, which requires large financial and non-financial companies to provide information to investors about the environmental performance of their assets and economic activities. In annual reports published in 2022, large companies were required to report the proportion of their economic activities that are considered as Taxonomy-eligible. An eligible economic activity is an activity that is described in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation. In 2023, large companies are required to report also activities that are considered as Taxonomy-aligned, i.e. activities that comply with the requirements for environmentally sustainable economic activities. In the beginning the focus is on activities contributing to climate objectives, climate change mitigation and adaptation, according to the EU Climate Delegated Act.\n\nIn addition, in March 2022, the Commission adopted a Complementary Climate Delegated Act including, under strict conditions, specific nuclear and gas energy activities in the list of economic activities covered by the EU taxonomy. It was published in July 2022 and applies as of January 2023.\n\nIn 2021, UPM carried out its first assessment to identify the economic activities which would be eligible i. e. included in the scope of EU Taxonomy.\n\nIn 2022, UPM conducted a thorough evaluation of the alignment of activities with the sustainability requirements defined in the regulation. After further investigation, UPM also re-evaluated some of the previous identified eligible activities. The assessments were carried out with the support of several UPM functions and businesses coordinated by UPM's finance and responsibility teams. EU NACE Classification (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) was used as a reference in activity identification. The identified eligible activities focus on the climate change mitigation objective. The assessment and its results are based on the current knowledge and available interpretation of the regulation and cover the substantial contribution criteria and the criteria for 'do not significant harm' for the respective activities. In addition, the fulfillment of the minimum social safeguard has been evaluated.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n142\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nRegarding the nuclear and fossil gas related activities, UPM identified the activities in nuclear power through its shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO) which has direct shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). TVO operates two nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto 2) and is constructing one new nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto (Olkiluoto 3), Finland. Olkiluoto 3 has proceeded to its test production phase. UPM did not recognise any fossil gas related activities as defined in the Disclosures and Complementary Climate Delegated Act.\n\nUPM has re-evaluated Taxonomy-eligible activities and made following changes to the eligible scope compared to 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 UPM reports all sales of co-generated energy from bioenergy within activity 4.20 as eligible, not separately within activities 4.15, 4.19 and 4.20.\n- \u00b7 UPM reclassified activity for its investment in the biochemical refinery from 3.14 to 3.6 that includes activities related to manufacture of new developed carbon-low technology.\n- \u00b7 The paper production from mostly recycled content and biocomposites business was reclassified from eligible under 5.9 to non-eligible, due to the EU Commission Notice on the interpretation for the Delegated Act  (2022/C 385/01) regarding the integrated value chains.\n\nNon-financial undertakings falling under the scope of the NonFinancial Reporting Directive are required to disclose the KPIs, the turnover, CapEx (capital expenditure) and OpEx (operating expenses) in relation to economic activities which are Taxonomy-eligible and aligned as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act. The eligibility and alignedrelated financial information to be disclosed pursuant to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation is presented in the following tables. The group has ensured that activities are accounted only once when calculating KPIs.\n\nIn 2022, UPM's total Taxonomy-aligned turnover including the nuclear activities was EUR 896 million, 8% of total sales, Taxonomyaligned CapEx was EUR 424 million, 26% of total CapEx and Taxonomy-aligned OpEx EUR 109 million, 17% of total OpEx as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\n## Turnover of taxonomy-eligible activities (excluding nuclear and fossil gas related activities)\n\n|                                                                                                                        |                    |                      |                               | Substantial contribution  criteria Clim ate  c h Clim ate  c h W ater  an d  Circ ular  P   | Substantial contribution  criteria Clim ate  c h Clim ate  c h W ater  an d  Circ ular  P   | Substantial contribution  criteria Clim ate  c h Clim ate  c h W ater  an d  Circ ular  P   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   | DNSH criteria ('Does Not Significantly Harm') B iov ersity Clim Clim ate  W ater  an Circ   |                                  |                       |                                                             |                                                            |                                       |                                                         |    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                    | Code(s)            | Absolute  turn ov er | P roportion of  turn ov er  % | an ge  m itigation                                                                          | an ge  adaptation                                                                           | m arin e  resourc es                                                                        | ollution an d  ec osy stem s                                                                | ate  c h an ge  m itigation                                                                 | c h an ge  adaptation                                                                       | d  m arin e  resourc es                                                                     | ular  ec on om y                                                                            | P ollution                                                                                  | B iov ersity an d  ec osy stem s | M in im um safeguards | Taxon omy  aligne d  propor tion of  turnov er,  year  2022 | Taxono my  aligne d  proport ion of  turnove r, year  2021 | Categ ory  (enabli ng  activit y = E) | ec on om y Cate gory  '(tran sition al  activi ty'=  T) |    |\n| A.

UPM has calculated the KPIs using the financial information presented in group consolidated financial statements 2022. The definitions of CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators are based on group interpretation of definitions set out in the Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\n## Turnover\n\nUPM has calculated turnover, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, based on the same accounting principles that apply for revenue in IFRS, i.e., covering all amounts derived from the sale of products and services in the course of ordinary activities. Total turnover corresponds to total sales as reported in group consolidated financial statements. Refer to Accounting policy in consolidated financial statements Note 2.2. Sales. Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover include only revenue from sales of products and services generated from activities that are included in the Taxonomy. The majority of UPM's products and services contributing to the turnover are not included in the EU Taxonomy. In determining the eligible and aligned turnover any specific fragments of production inputs, such as use of sustainable raw material or energy, have not been included in the eligible turnover if the main activity is not included in the Taxonomy.\n\nUPM's Taxonomy-eligible turnover includes sales of wood and woodbased biomass such as logs, pulpwood and forest residues from UPM's\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n147\n\nown and leased forests to third party customers (other sources of wood excluded from the eligible turnover), sales of forestry services to private forestry owners, sales of energy generated from hydropower, sales of wood-based renewable diesel and naphtha for transport and petrochemicals, sales of heat and power generated from biomass in combined heat and power plants and revenues from leased vessels. Regarding the power plants, the portion of the fossil fuels has been excluded from the turnover. Apart from the sales of forestry services to private forest owners and revenues from leased vessels, all the UPM's eligible turnover is also Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n## CapEx\n\nUPM has included in CapEx, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, additions to tangible and intangible assets, before any depreciations, impairments, amortisation charges and fair valuations during the financial year, as accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 38 Intangible assets, IAS 41 Agriculture and IFRS 16 Leases. CapEx corresponds to cash payments to acquire fixed assets in the Consolidated cash flow statement adjusted with amounts accrued but not paid at the end of reporting period, and additions to leased assets. Refer to line items Capital expenditure and Additions to forest assets in Consolidated cash flow statement and Note 5.2. Leases in UPM consolidated financial statements 2022.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible CapEx includes purchased and leased land for afforestation, purchased forest land, capitalised forest regeneration costs during the growth cycle, capitalised investments in new",

Apart from the CapEx related to investments on leased vessels, all the UPM's eligible CapEx is also Taxonomy-aligned. Capital expenditure presented in the UPM Annual report within Other financial information differs from Taxonomy-CapEx as it does not include additions to forest assets and leased assets.\n\n## OpEx\n\nUPM has included in OpEx, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, research and development costs as accounted for in accordance IAS 38 Intangible assets, short term lease expenses as accounted for in accordance IFRS 16 Leases, and costs of day-to-day servicing (i.e., repairs and maintenance) of property, plant and equipment as accounted for in accordance IAS 16. Costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment include direct salaries of maintenance personnel, maintenance materials and maintenance services outsourced. In addition, as UPM owns a significant amount of forest assets, it considers forest management and support services as day-to-day servicing of assets as defined in EU Disclosures Delegated Act. OpEx is included in consolidated income statement line item Costs and expenses, refer Note 2.3. Operating expenses and other operating income.\n\nResearch and development costs included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx relate to technologies and products dedicated to the reduction of GHG emissions. These costs relate to Taxonomy-eligible activities 1.3, 3.6 and 4.13 and include mainly new biochemicals biorefinery and next generation biofuels refinery R&D costs. Day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx includes maintenance costs of hydropower and biofuels production facilities and costs related to combined heat power plants and leased vessels. Costs of day-to-day servicing of forest assets included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx relate to forestry infrastructure maintenance, forest fire fighting, protection and environmental activities whereas forest regeneration costs, e.g., planting, growing of seedlings and operation of nurseries, are included in CapEx. All the above-mentioned Taxonomy-eligible OpEx apart from the costs related to leased vessels are also Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n148\n\n## Nuclear and Gas related activities\n\nUPM has reported separately its activities related to Nuclear and Gas as defined in the Complementary Climate Delegated Act (2022/1214). The assessment is based on the comprehensive study made by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) which is in control of the nuclear operations where UPM has shareholdings via Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), refer to Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible turnover from nuclear related activities includes UPM's sales to external customers related to existing nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1 & 2, activity 4.28) and the new constructed power plant (Olkiluoto 3, activity 4.27) which is in the test production phase. Taxonomy-eligible OpEx in activity 4.27 includes, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, UPM's share of day-to-day servicing costs related to property, plant and equipment in the existing nuclear power plants Olkiluoto 1 & 2.

We are a part of the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI) and a member of the 4evergreen alliance, an initiative created by CEPI to raise the overall recycling rate of fibre-based packaging to 90% by 2030. We also joined  EUROPEN, the European association that strives towards carbon neutrality of the packaging value chain.\n\nWe want to take part in the developments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, we actively participated in Hydrogen Cluster Finland, the EU's Clean Hydrogen Alliance and participated in the Roundtable on Clean Hydrogen in industrial applications.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n150\n\n## Our focus in 2022\n\n## Implementing sustainable product design concept\n\nOur 2030 responsibility targets and our contribution to the UN SDGs are integrated into our R&D activities and product development. We want our products to create value for our stakeholders during the whole product lifecycle.\n\nWe started to implement the sustainable product design concept and worked on cases for new product development to form solid sustainability value propositions. At UPM Specialty Papers, the concept was successfully used from development to the new packaging paper launch. The new concept will be adopted gradually in all of our businesses.\n\nOur approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both of which are incorporated in sustainable product design practices. We use different sustainability tools, such as Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), and biodegradability and recyclability testing in product development. LCAs are a good tool to support businesses in sustainability communication.\n\n## Innovating climate-positive products\n\nOur biochemicals biorefinery under construction in Leuna, Germany, will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging as well as pharma and cosmetics products. We introduced UPM BioPura\u2122, renewable monoethylene glycols (bMEG) produced from carbon-neutral feedstocks.\n\nWe are in the basic engineering phase of a next-generation biofuels biorefinery. This biorefinery would produce high-quality renewable fuels, including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with chemical and plastic alternatives.\n\nWe are also examining new ways to utilise renewable fibre-based materials for textiles, nonwovens, hygiene products, labels and flexible packaging for example. We also look into opportunities provided by green hydrogen and biogenic CO2.\n\n## Expanding R&D infrastructure\n\nUPM's four Biofore Base research centres accelerate the development of bio-based products. The new Leuna Biofore Base in Germany works in connection with the upcoming biochemicals refinery and specialises in developing new molecular bioproducts. The centres focus on research, piloting and analytics enabling seamless collaboration with customers, value chain partners and research organisations such as universities.\n\nThey work closely with UPM's mills, businesses and business-specific research centres in various countries.\n\nUPM's first forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations began operations in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay. The centre's research work is mainly focused on developing genetic materials with high productivity, optimal wood quality and tolerance to the pests and diseases that can affect plantations. The new centre contains state-of-theart laboratories and equipment, as well as specific greenhouses and nurseries for various research and development purposes.\n\n## Developing R&D competences\n\nR&D supports our growth and responsibility targets globally and enhance technology-triggered business opportunities and protect performance in existing businesses. The strong focus is on the growth businesses and close collaboration with customers and production.\n\nWe continuously develop our competences for the future needs of our businesses. Competence development is essential for the entire organisation, including both technical capabilities and ways of working. We focused especially on our digi and data and chemistry capabilities. We also started an apprenticeship training to educate new laboratory technicians and piloting plant operators for our growing needs in these areas. In addition to internal competence development, we collaborate with universities and vocational schools to enhance mutual learning, for example through the Aalto International Talent mentoring programme.\n\n## UPM Biochemicals - ramping up new business\n\nThe world's first industrial-scale biorefinery in Leuna is rapidly taking shape, while a robust business platform is almost complete and new customer partnerships confirm a promising commercial future.\n\nManufacturers in multiple sectors must reduce their carbon footprints urgently. UPM's new generation of biochemicals, sourced from sustainably managed forests, will enable brands to redefine their net zero targets, significantly reduce their scope 3 emissions and switch out of fossil-based chemical feedstocks for good. Our biochemicals will support the transition of the chemicals industry towards a renewable circular bioeconomy.\n\nThe EUR 750 million-investment at Leuna is rapidly taking shape, in anticipation for start-up by the end of 2023. The biorefinery will be the first industrial-scale facility of its type ever built, requiring precision in every detail of planning and construction.\n\nThe biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and renewable functional fillers. In addition, the biorefinery will produce biomonopropylene glycols (BioMPG) and industrial sugars.\n\nAfter confirming in January 2022 that the completion of the biorefinery would be delayed, we successfully navigated the challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruptions.\n\nSubstantial progress has been made on-site: the concrete foundations have been laid; the huge pipe rack that will bear the grid for utilities has been built and the first structures are almost complete. [SPU1]\n\nAlong with developing the facility, we are preparing the business to become fully operational. We have hired and started training the operations personnel and established reliable supply chains.\n\nWe have also extended our feedstock sourcing network, resulting in the first deliveries of wood on site in November. This has enabled us to begin testing our wood handling and processing operations. The networks we have built with partners in the forest value chain have helped us to address the benefits of wood use in wider policy discussions.\n\nWe took important steps to bring our products to global markets. We presented our lignin-based Renewable Functional Filler (RFF) solutions, UPM Biomotion\u2122, at the world's biggest rubber industry trade\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n151\n\nfair (DKT IRC) in Nuremberg, further strengthened our distributor network.\n\nWe were ranked by the European Rubber Journal as the most important sustainability project in the elastomers and rubber industry. Our renewable monoethylene glycols (bMEG), UPM BioPura\u2122, were shortlisted by Packaging Europe magazine as one of the standout innovations for its 2022 Sustainability Awards.\n\nWe also announced commercial partnerships for UPM BioPura that will transform the carbon footprint of value chains in different industries. For manufacturers like Dongsung Chemical (a supplier to global footwear brands) and Haertol (a leading engine and battery coolant producer), this is an opportunity to both advance their net zero commitments and achieve a competitive advantage in their global markets, where demand for sustainable products is increasing.\n\nIn 2022 we also staffed our research and application development laboratories, ensuring high quality, continuous process optimisation and ongoing research and development activities around our portfolio of biochemicals.\n\nWhile fully focusing on completing the project and ramping up the business, we have also built the fundamentals for further growth in Biochemicals. We have brought together a team of experts to assess and study future applications for biochemicals. We are exploring opportunities to address needs in additional chemical value chains, utilising side-stream products or based on the technological platform we are now completing.\n\nA heightened focus on reduced carbon emissions means the demand for renewable materials will continue to increase. We are actively working to optimise processes and material streams to further reduce emissions, seeking carbon neutrality - or even carbon negativity - of the products produced in our biorefinery.\n\nThe sustainable sourcing of biomass is a vital factor for our commercial partners.  The wood used to produce UPM's renewable biochemicals is 100% certified and sourced from regional beechwood forests in and around Leuna, conserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems. All the wood used is fully traceable and supported by a verified third-party chain of custody.\n\n## UPM Biomedicals - advancing biomedical innovations\n\nUPM Biomedicals is at the forefront of innovation and commercialisation, with a particular focus on life science and clinical applications.\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products for medical and life science applications. The main component in our products is high-quality nanocellulose, refined from birch wood. All products are animal-free.\n\nWe actively collaborate with universities, research centres and key industrial partners in the fields of high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care. More than 520 patents and patent applications protect our existing and future products.\n\nIn life sciences, our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release living cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a pilot study of GrowDex use in a cell-based model of a liver. Liver models are used in testing the toxicity of almost every new pharmaceutical candidate.  The first mini-livers and other mini-organs are currently growing in UPM's own cell laboratory to better support our customers and product development team.\n\nGrowInk\u2122 is a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting, used in areas like cancer research, where models of tumours can be printed to test",

In 2022, we continued to supply nanocellulose to Cellink.\n\nIn the clinical field, many Finnish healthcare professionals and hospitals already use our CE-marked FibDex\u00ae wound dressings. The products are also being piloted in selected university hospitals in the Nordic countries and in Germany. In 2022, we launched a new clinical investigation for superficial dermal burns led by experienced plastic surgeons in the university hospitals of Uppsala and Link\u00f6ping in Sweden.\n\n## UPM Biocomposites - the best in class\n\nUPM Biocomposites is creating circular economy solutions through the manufacture of innovative composite materials and decking products. The materials are based on our own research and development.\n\nUPM ProFi utilises European post-consumer plastic waste and postindustrial label waste to manufacture high quality composite decking. The label production side streams come from UPM Raflatac and its customers, with the waste collected and delivered to Germany where the composite decking is manufactured. We also utilise recycled plastic from European post-consumer waste in the manufacturing process.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n152\n\nThe UPM ProFi Piazza product range is made with up to 75% recycled materials and offers best-in-class performance. We are a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to increase the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the uncertainty surrounding construction, as well as continued consumer uncertainty, were reflected in UPM ProFi's sales. However, we managed to increase market shares in Central Europe, where we stand out thanks to the responsibility and recyclability of our locally produced products. The UPM ProFi Piazza product range was expanded.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, enabling a reduction in the carbon footprint of the end product by up to 80% when compared to similar products made from fossil-based materials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. Products comply with food safety standards and other similar quality requirements.\n\nBusiness growth continued in 2022 with our customers launching new products on the market, from storage boxes to design objects. Together with new and existing customers, we developed and piloted new end-use areas for the material. Commercial interest was reflected in the strong demand for almost 100% biobased UPM Formi EcoAce.\n\n## R&D's role in different businesses\n\n| BUSINESS AREA              | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Fibres                 | In 2022, UPM saw a clear benefit of having research expertise in several continents. Our global R&D presence in Asia, Europe and the  Americas, enabled us to work faster and better with our customers and partners to find and implement required solutions. By having a local  presence at a global scale we were able to implement solutions even during the exceptional COVID-19 pandemic.  Several developments were made to improve operational reliability, safety and environmental performance at our pulp mills. To further  strengthen our strategy and commitment to developing sustainable and high-quality eucalyptus plantations for pulp production, we opened a new  forestry research centre in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay. The centre's research work focuses mainly on developing genetic materials with high productivity,  improved wood quality and good tolerance to the main pests and diseases that can affect plantation operations.  After a period of solution development stage for our second state-of-the-art eucalyptus pulp mill scheduled to start operating in Uruguay by the  end of the Q1 2023, more emphasis was placed on developing and piloting the first stages of our next fibre based and by-products growth |\n| UPM Energy                 | The focus was on improving the cost-competitiveness and environmental performance of hydropower production assets and on developing  competencies and business operations related to the optimisation of industrial energy consumption and demand-side flexibility.

Through the issuance authorisation described below, the number of shares may increase to a maximum of 558,735,699. On 31 December 2022, UPM held 411,653 treasury shares, representing approximately 0.08% of the total number of UPM shares and voting rights.

The authorisation will be valid for 18 months from the date of the AGM resolution.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 29 March 2022 authorised the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of new shares, the transfer of treasury shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares in proportion to the shareholders' existing holdings in the Company, or in a directed share issue, deviating from the shareholder's pre-emptive subscription right. The Board of Directors may also decide on a share issue without payment to the Company itself.

Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of UPM-Kymmene Corporation to be held on 12 April 2023  that an aggregate dividend of EUR 1.50 per share be paid based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the financial year ending 31 December 2022, and that the remaining portion of the distributable funds be retained in the Company's unrestricted shareholders' equity. The Board proposes that the dividend be paid in two instalments.\n\nThe first dividend instalment, EUR 0.75 per share, is proposed to be paid to shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date for the first dividend instalment 14 April 2023. The Board proposes that the payment date for the first dividend instalment would be on 21April 2023.\n\nThe second dividend instalment, EUR 0.75 per share, is proposed to be paid to shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date for the second dividend instalment 26 October 2023. The Board proposes that the payment date for the second dividend instalment would be on 2 November 2023.\n\nIf the payment of the dividend is prevented due to applicable law, regulation or unexpected circumstances, the Board will resolve, as soon as practically possible, on a new record date and payment date.\n\nOn the date of the dividend proposal, 2 February 2023, the registered number of the Company's shares is 533,735,699. The aforementioned number of shares includes 411,653 treasury shares which are not entitled to dividend. As a result, the proposed dividend would total EUR 800.0 million.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, the distributable funds of the parent company were EUR 2,415,624,457.82. The loss of the parent company for the period was EUR 189,734,449.30. No material changes have taken place in respect of the Company's financial position after the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Board Of Directors, the proposed distribution of profits does not risk the solvency of the Company.\n\nSignatures of the annual accounts and the report of the Board of Directors for the year 2022\n\nHelsinki, 2 February 2023\n\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos                  | Henrik Ehrnrooth   | Topi Manner       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Chair Emma FitzGerald           | Jari Gustafsson    | Piia-Noora Kauppi |\n| Marjan Oudeman                  | Martin \u00e0 Porta     | Kim Wahl          |\n| Jussi Pesonen President and CEO |                    |                   |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n157",

Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by UPM's central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management, under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financial risks are described in the relevant notes as described below.\n\n| FINANCIAL RISK                 | NOTE                                 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management               |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Financial counterparty risk    | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting |\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on the financial statements\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on UPM financial statements has been relatively limited. The group uses estimates and makes significant judgements when valuating certain assets and liabilities, including energy shareholdings, forest assets, retirement benefit obligations and provisions. The group has assessed the impact of COVID-19 to balance sheet items by considering indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of inventories, and collectability of trade receivables. The expectations of future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs were revised to reflect changed economic environment. Based on these assessments, no significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of said assets were made due to COVID-19. However, the increased uncertainty in the economic environment can lead to significant adjustments to the carrying amount of assets.\n\nThe group expects that it will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. UPM has a strong financial position. Net debt in the balance sheet amounted to EUR 2,374 million on 31 December 2022. Cash, investment funds, and unused committed credit facilities amounted to EUR 6.4 billion. The facilities and UPM's outstanding debt have no financial covenants.\n\n## Accounting implications of the effects of the Russia's war in Ukraine\n\nThe group has assessed the balance sheet impact of Russia's war in Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed on Russia, by considering indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of inventories, and collectability of trade receivables. The expectations of future cash flows have been revised to reflect changed economic environment.\n\nDue to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all operating assets and uninsured receivables locating or relating to operations in these countries in Q1 2022. Impairment of fixed assets, inventories and other receivables amounting to EUR 95 million was reported as items affecting comparability. In addition, in Q1 the group increased the general provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables by EUR 17 million, which is impacting comparable EBIT. At the end of 2022, the\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n165\n\nimpairment was EUR 80 million and the credit loss provision was EUR 8 million.\n\nFor the time being, UPM businesses have suspended deliveries to Russia as well as wood sourcing in and from Russia. UPM has also suspended the UPM Chudovo plywood mill operations following carefully the legislation in Russia and with due consideration of local employees, customers, and stakeholders.\n\nThe group expects that it will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. \u00bb Refer Note 2.1 Business Areas and Note 4.6 Working capital for financial information on implications of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n## 1.3  Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nUPM's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and subsidiaries controlled by UPM. All group entities apply consistently UPM's accounting policies. All intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities and unrealised profits, as well as intragroup profit distributions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is a contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nUPM's share in joint operations is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the group's own assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses in the arrangement together with UPM's proportionate share in the joint assets, liabilities and joint income and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions between UPM and its joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the group has significant influence but no control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions without the power to control or jointly control those policies. Joint ventures are joint arrangements where the group has joint control with other parties and the parties have rights to the arrangement's net assets.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Associates and joint ventures follow the group accounting policies for consolidation purpose.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent company and noncontrolling interests is presented on the face of the income statement. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent company.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between consideration paid and the acquired share of the carrying value of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in",

Gains or losses of disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, net of transaction costs.\n\n## 1.4  Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nUPM records foreign exchange differences relating to ordinary business operations within the appropriate line items above operating profit and those relating to financial items are presented separately as a net amount in finance costs.\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from euro are translated into euros at quarterly average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. All resulting translation differences are recognised as a separate component in other comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange differences arising\n\nfrom the translation of net investment in foreign operations and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign entity is partially disposed of, sold or liquidated, translation differences accrued in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale/liquidation.\n\n## 1.5  Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe group has reviewed IFRS standard amendments effective on periods starting 1 January 2022. The amendments effective as of 1 January 2022 did not have any impact on the group's financial statements.\n\n## Change in the composition of reportable segments\n\nThe group has changed its reportable segments composition by moving the UPM Biofuels business into Other Operations on 1 January 2022.\n\nUPM has formed a new business unit by combining UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals and UPM Biocomposites businesses. The aim is to speed up business growth and to leverage the capabilities and competences across projects efficiently. This unit has inherited the name UPM Biorefining and is reported as part of Other operations. UPM Pulp and UPM Timber priorly reported under UPM Biorefining are reported as UPM Fibres business area from 1 January 2022.\n\nFollowing the change, Other Operations include UPM Forest, UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals and UPM Biocomposites businesses as well as group services. The change has impacted KPIs of UPM Biorefining (1.1.2022 UPM Fibres) reportable segment and Other Operations. The comparative periods have been restated according to the new reporting principles. The reporting change has no impact on group financial result or balance sheet.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n166\n\n## UPM Biorefining (1.1.2022 UPM Fibres)\n\n| 2021                                                               | UPM  Biorefining  as  published   | UPM  Fibres  restated   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Sales EURm                                                         | 2,945                             | 2,794                   |\n| Comparable EBITDA, EURm                                            | 1,016                             | 961                     |\n| % of sales                                                         | 34.5                              | 34.4                    |\n| Change in fair value of forest assets and wood  harvested, EURm    | -9                                | -9                      |\n| Share of results of associated companies and joint  ventures, EURm | 2                                 | 2                       |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment  charges, EURm           | -191                              | -173                    |\n| Operating profit, EURm                                             | 817                               | 781                     |\n| % of sales                                                         | 27.8                              | 27.9                    |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm                                              | 817                               | 781                     |\n| % of sales                                                         | 27.8                              | 27.9                    |\n| Capital employed (average), EURm                                   | 4,437                             | 4,277                   |\n| Comparable ROCE, %                                                 | 18.4                              | 18.3                    |\n\n## Other operations\n\n| 2021                                                            | As  published   | Restated   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Sales EURm                                                      | 280             | 483        |\n| Comparable EBITDA, EURm                                         | -19             | 36         |\n| Change in fair value of forest assets and wood  harvested, EURm | 120             | 120        |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment  charges, EURm        | -25             | -44        |\n| Operating profit, EURm                                          | 75              | 112        |\n| Items affecting comparability in operating profit,  EURm        | -1              | -1         |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm                                           | 76              | 113        |\n| Capital employed (average), EURm                                | 1,992           | 2,152      |\n| Comparable ROCE, %                                              | 3.8             | 5.2        |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## 2.

The group has a portfolio of five businesses that operate on growing markets and one business that faces declining demand. All of UPM businesses are competitive and have strong market positions. Financial target setting, follow up and allocation of resources in the group's performance management process is mainly based on the business area comparable EBIT and comparable ROCE.\n\nUPM presents comparable performance measures to reflect the underlying business performance and to enhance comparability from period to period. However, the comparable performance measures used by management should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS.

The revenue comprises also sales of energy, biofuels, sawn timber and plywood products and a very limited amount of services not related to sale of goods.\n\nUPM sells a proportion of its products to several major customers. The largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 3% (2%) of UPM's sales and the ten largest customers represented approximately 15% (15%) of such sales.\n\nThe group disaggregates its external sales by business area, because this depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Sales by UPM business areas are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to UPM's President and CEO who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the business areas. The goods and services included in sales revenue of each business area are presented in below tables.\n\n- \u00bb Refer Note 2.1 Business areas for information on UPM products.\n\n## External sales by major products\n\n| BUSINESS AREA                    | BUSINESS                                                                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EUR million                      |                                                                                 |        |        |\n| UPM Fibres                       | UPM Pulp, UPM Timber                                                            | 2,052  | 2,092  |\n| UPM Energy                       | UPM Energy                                                                      | 343    | 290    |\n| UPM Raflatac                     | UPM Raflatac                                                                    | 1,981  | 1,671  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers             | UPM Specialty Papers                                                            | 1,423  | 1,275  |\n| UPM Communication Papers         | UPM Communication Papers                                                        | 4,792  | 3,536  |\n| UPM Plywood                      | UPM Plywood                                                                     | 518    | 471    |\n| Other operations                 | UPM Forest, UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals, UPM  Biocomposites | 608    | 474    |\n| Eliminations and reconciliations | Eliminations and reconciliations                                                | 2      | 5      |\n| Total                            | Total                                                                           | 11,720 | 9,814  |\n\n| BUSINESS                 | PRODUCT RANGE                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Pulp                 | Softwood, birch and eucalyptus pulp                                                                       |\n| UPM Timber               | Standard and special sawn timber                                                                          |\n| UPM Energy               | Electricity and related services                                                                          |\n| UPM Raflatac             | Self-adhesive paper and film label stock                                                                  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | Labelling materials, release base papers, flexible packaging materials, office papers, graphic papers     |\n| UPM Communication Papers | Graphic papers for various end uses                                                                       |\n| UPM Plywood              | Plywood and veneer products                                                                               |\n| UPM Forest               | Wood and wood-based biomass (logs, pulpwood, chips, forest residues etc.), full forestry service offering |\n| UPM Biofuels             | Wood-based renewable diesel for transport and renewable naphtha for transport and petrochemicals          |\n| UPM Biochemicals         | Lignin products for industrial use                                                                        |\n| UPM Biomedicals          | Wood-based products for biomedical applications                                                           |\n| UPM Biocomposites        | UPM ProFi decking products and UPM Formi granules                                                         |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n172\n\n## Sales by business area\n\n| EURm                     | 2022   | 2021   | CHANGE   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| UPM Fibres               | 2,704  | 2,794  | -3  %    |\n| UPM Energy               | 734    | 526    | 40  %    |\n| UPM Raflatac             | 1,982  | 1,671  | 19  %    |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | 1,677  | 1,482  | 13  %    |\n| UPM Communication Papers | 4,866  | 3,577  | 36  %    |\n| UPM Plywood              | 539    | 492    | 9    %   |\n| Other operations         | 634    | 483    | 31  %    |\n| Eliminations             | -1,415 | -1,210 | -

The biggest factor affecting UPM's financial results is the sales price of paper. A change in the volume delivered has less than half of the effect of the same percentage change in sales prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Sales of goods\n\nUPM's performance obligation in the contracts with customers consists of providing the goods specified in the contracts. Revenue from UPM's product sales is recognised when performance obligation is satisfied, which takes place at point in time when control of the good has been transferred to the customer. In UPM's customer contracts the transfer of control and thus timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on delivery terms. Group terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2020, the official rules for interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. Major part of the sales contracts is on delivery terms basis, whereby delivery is not a promised service to the customer, as the control of a good does not transfer to the customer before shipment. Revenue and the corresponding receivable are recorded at the point in time when the product is delivered to the destination point for terms designated Delivered Duty Paid ('DDP') or Delivered at Place ('DAP'). For sales transactions designated free of carriage (FCA), revenue is recorded at the time of shipment. For sales transactions designated as Carriage paid to (CPT) or Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP), the portion of revenue relating to goods is recorded at the time of loading and the portion of revenue relating to delivery services over time when the service has been performed.\n\nUPM sells energy to NordPool electricity market. Revenue is recognised when electricity is transmissed over time.\n\n## Sales of services\n\nUPM provides forest expertise and contracting services to woodland and forestry owners and freight services (free space on group's vessels sold as freight services). Revenues from services are recorded over time when the service has been performed. Sales of services is very limited and thus the group does not report it separately.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe group recognises revenue as an amount equal to the price specified in the customer contract net of any sales taxes, cash flow hedging results of sales in foreign currency, hedges of energy sales and variable consideration, when applicable. Variable consideration is defined as any variability that may occur between the sales price and the amount UPM expects to receive. The variable consideration includes mainly cash discounts and volume rebates that encourage the customer to take\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n173\n\nspecific volumes in a given timescale. In addition, the group gives the customers the right for purchase price refund in case the products do not meet the quality as specified in the agreement. The amount of variable consideration is recognised as a refund liability when some of the amount received is expected to be refunded to the customer. Customer rebates payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period and expected quality claims are estimated using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund liability is included in trade and other payables.\n\nReceivables are recognised when the goods are delivered, and the consideration is unconditional except for the passage of time. For most of UPM's customer contracts the period between the transfer of goods or services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than 12 months. For these contracts the group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components.\n\nAdvance payments received from customers are recognised as contract liability. UPM does not have any contract assets arising from contracts with customers.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 4.6 Working capital for information on contract liabilities and refund liabilities.\n\n## 2.3  Operating expenses and other operating income\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses excluding forest assets fair value change, wood harvested and share of results of associates and joint ventures are presented below.\n\n| EURm                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs and expenses                        |        |        |\n| Raw materials, consumables and goods      | 6,260  | 5,446  |\n| Employee costs  1)                        | 1,181  | 1,094  |\n| Other operating costs and expenses  2)    | 1,028  | 670    |\n| Delivery costs and other external charges | 1,001  | 894    |\n| Total                                     | 9,470  | 8,104  |\n\n- 1) \u00bb Refer Note 3 Employee rewards, for further information.\n\n## 2) Distribution of other operating costs and expense\n\n| EURm                                         | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rents and lease expenses                     | 29     |     25 |\n| Emission expenses  1)                        | 70     |   -106 |\n| Losses on sale of non-current assets         | 1      |      0 |\n| Credit losses                                | 9      |     -5 |\n| Maintenance and other operating expenses  2) | 919    |    756 |\n| Total                                        | 1,028  |    670 |\n\n- 1) Emission expenses include losses on sales of emission rights EUR 2 (gains 144) million.\n- 2) Other operating expenses include, among others, energy as well as expenses related to services and group's administration.",

The liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights amounted to EUR 53 million (39 million) and is recognised in provisions. The emission rights recognised in intangible assets are specified below:\n\n| EURm                                   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January           |    104 |     95 |\n| Emission rights received and purchased |    231 |     86 |\n| Deliveries and disposals               |   -100 |    -78 |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December         |    235 |    104 |\n| Accumulated costs                      |    236 |    105 |\n| Accumulated impairments                |     -1 |     -1 |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December         |    235 |    104 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as they generate future economic benefits, and UPM can the measure the cost reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives, usually not exceeding five years.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply with the attached conditions. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and accordingly directly reduce the annual depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are recognised in the income statement in the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate. A government grant can also become receivable by the group as compensation for expenses incurred in a previous period. Such a grant is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income mainly includes gains on the disposal of noncurrent assets and rental income. Further, other operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of UPM's normal business activities. Gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying hedge accounting are also recognised in other operating income.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nThe group participates in the European Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Emission rights received from governments free of charge to emit a fixed tonnage of carbon dioxide in a fixed period of time give rise to an intangible asset for the emission rights, a government grant and a liability for the obligation to deliver emission rights equal to the emissions that have been made during the compliance period.\n\nEmission rights are initially recognised as intangible assets based on market value at the date of initial recognition. Emission rights are not amortised. If the market price of emissions rights at the balance sheet date is less than the recognised costs, any surplus emission rights that are not required to cover actual and estimated emissions during the financial year, are impaired to the market price.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the same time as emission rights and are recognised in other operating income in the income statement, systematically, over the compliance period to which the corresponding emission rights relate.\n\nThe liability to deliver emission rights is recognised based on actual emissions. The emissions realised are expensed under other operating costs and expenses in the income statement and presented as a provision in the balance sheet. The liability is settled using emission rights on hand, measured at the carrying amount of those emission rights. Emission rights and associated provisions are derecognised when disposed. Any profit or loss represents the costs of purchasing additional rights to cover excess emissions, the sale of unused rights in the case realised emission are under emission rights received free of charge or the impairment of unused emission rights.\n\n## 2.4  Earnings per share and dividend\n\nOn 2 February 2023, UPM's Board of Directors revised the company's dividend policy to be based on earnings instead of cash flow. According to new dividend policy, the company aims to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time. \u00bb Refer Note 9.3 Events after the balance sheet date.\n\nThe dividend paid in 2022 were EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share) which is 55% of the operating cash flow per share and in 2021 EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share). The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 800 million, EUR 1.50 per share, will be paid in respect of 2022. The proposed dividend represents 49% of UPM's comparable earnings per share for the year 2022.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n175\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| EURm                                                       | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to owners of the parent  company, EURm | 1,526   | 1,286   |\n| Weighted average no. of shares (1,000)                     | 533,324 | 533,324 |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                              | 2.86    | 2.41    |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                            | 2.86    | 2.41    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit for the period attributable to each share.

The amount of the incentive is linked to the executive's position and achievement of annually set targets. The maximum incentives amount to a total of 110% of the annual base salary to the Business Area Executives and to a total of 90% of annual base salary to the other members of the Group Executive Team. For the President and CEO, the maximum annual incentive amounts to 150% of the annual base salary.\n\nThe expenses recognised in income statement in respect of sharebased payments for the Group Executive Team were EUR 3.6 million (3.8 million).\n\nAccording to the service agreement, the President and CEO would have been entitled to retire in November 2020 at the age of 60 but at the request of the company's Board of Directors, the President and CEO has decided to continue in his position. However, UPM's President and CEO Jussi Pesonen has announced that he will exercise his right to retire from UPM during 2024.\n\n## 3.3  Share-based payments\n\nUPM offers rewards and recognition with an emphasis on high performance. All UPM's employees belong to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. In addition, UPM has two long-term incentive schemes: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) is targeted at the President and CEO and other Group Executive Team (GET) members as well as other selected members of the management. Under the PSP 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 UPM shares are awarded based on total shareholder return during a three-year earning period. Total shareholder return takes into account share price appreciation and paid dividends. The performance measures for the PSP 2022-2024 comprise the total shareholder return (80% weighting) and selected environmental, social and governance related (ESG) measures, which are reduction of fossil\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n177\n\nThe President and CEO has a voluntary pension benefit in addition to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The President and CEO's voluntary pension benefit was arranged through a defined benefit plan until the end of November 2020. The last contribution to the defined benefit plan was made in 2020. Under the defined benefit plan, the target pension was 60% of the average indexed earnings from the last ten full calendar years of employment calculated according to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The income of the President and CEO's defined benefit pension plan in 2022 was EUR 0.5 million (1.3 million in 2021). The plan assets amounted to EUR 10.8 million (15.0 million) and the obligation amounted to EUR 9.6 million (12.8 million).\n\nAs of December 2020, the voluntary pension benefit is arranged through a defined contribution plan. First contribution to the defined contribution plan took place in 2021.\n\nThe retirement age of other members of the Group Executive Team is 63. Other Group Executive Team members are under defined contribution plans.\n\nShould the company or the President and CEO give notice of termination of the service agreement, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the 12-month notice period. For GET members, the period for severance pay is 12 months, in addition to the six months' salary for the notice period, unless notice is given for reasons that are solely attributable to the executive. Should a GET member give notice of termination to the company, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the notice period.\n\nIf there is a change of control in the company, the President and CEO may terminate his service agreement within three months and each GET member within one month from closing the takeover and shall receive compensation equivalent to 24 months' base salary.\n\nCO2 emissions from UPM's own combustion and purchased electricity by 65% by 2030 from 2015 level (10% weighting), achievement of a net positive impact on biodiversity in the Company's own forests in Finland (5% weighting) and achievement of gender pay equity (5% weighting). In all plans, the earned shares are delivered after the earning period has ended.",

Prior to share delivery, the share rewards earned are adjusted with dividends and other capital distributions, if any, paid to all shareholders during the restriction period.\n\n| DEFERRED BONUS PLANS                                            | DBP 2019                    | DBP 2020                    | DBP 2021                    | DBP 2022                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| No. of participants (at grant)                                  | 390                         | 393                         | 428                         | 451                         |\n| No. of participants (at 31 December 2022)                       | 334                         | 330                         | 378                         | 423                         |\n| Max no. of shares to be delivered (at grant)                    | 460,000                     | 429,558                     | 459,912                     | 487,130                     |\n| Estimated no. of shares to be delivered at 31 December 2022  1) | 180,334                     | 141,642                     | 362,295                     | 395,908                     |\n| Share delivery (year)                                           | 2022                        | 2023                        | 2024                        | 2025                        |\n| Earning criteria                                                | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA |\n\nThe indicated actuals and estimates of the share rewards under the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan represent the gross amount of the rewards of which the applicable taxes will be deducted before the shares are delivered to the participants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's long-term share incentive plans are recognised as equitysettled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions depending on the settlement. The group classifies the transactions with net settlement features for tax obligations as equity-settled in its entirety. Shares are valued using the market rate on the grant date. The settlement is a combination of shares and cash. The group may obtain the necessary shares by using its treasury shares or may purchase shares from the market. PSP and DBP share deliveries are executed by using already existing shares and the plans, therefore, have no dilutive effect.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n178\n\n## 3.4  Retirement benefit obligations\n\nThe group operates various pension schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries of operations. Retirement benefits are employee benefits that are payable usually after the termination of employment, such as pensions and post-employment medical care.\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nThe pension plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or to trustee-administered funds or foundations and classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n\nDefined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are presented below:\n\n| EURm                                                       | FINLAND   | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   |   TOTAL FINLAND | TOTAL FINLAND   | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   | TOTAL   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-----|----------------------|---------|\n| Present value of funded obligations                        | 27        | 316          | 30  | 11                   |             384 | 577             | 542          | 39  | 15                   | 1,174   |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                  | -26       | -300         | -2  | -11                  |            -340 | -632            | -565         | -2  | -15                  | -1,214  |\n| Deficit (+)/surplus (-)                                    | 0         | 16           | 27  | 0                    |              44 | -55             | -23          | 36  | -                    | -40     |\n| Present value of unfunded  obligations                     | -         | -            | 414 | 52                   |             466 | -               | -            | 548 | 68                   | 616     |\n| Net defined benefit liability (+)/ asset (-)               | 0         | 16           | 442 | 52                   |             510 | -55             | -23          | 585 | 68                   | 576     |\n| Net retirement benefit asset in the  balance sheet         | -1        | -            | -   | -                    |              -1 | -56             | -23          | -   | -                    | -79     |\n| Net retirement benefit liability in the  balance sheet  1) | 1         | 16           | 442 | 52                   |             511 | 2               | -            | 585 | 68                   | 655     |\n\nApproximately 15% (24%) of UPM's employees are active members of defined benefit arrangement plans. In 2022, the most significant defined benefit plan in Finland (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6) was replaced with defined contribution arrangement. Following the replacement, UPM's most significant defined benefit arrangements are in the UK and in Germany. The group has defined benefit obligations also in Austria, Holland, France, Canada and in the US.\n\n## Finland\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). TyEL provides the employee with insurance protection for old age, disability and death.\n\nGroup's Finnish employees are mainly insured with an insurance company and these arrangements qualify as defined contributions plans. At the end of 2021, approximately 21% of group's Finnish employees were insured with TyEL foundation (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6), that is classified as a defined benefit plan. In 2022, the TyEL foundation was replaced with defined contribution arrangement. The assets and liabilities of the plan were transferred to the insurance company and the\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n179\n\ngroup recognised EUR 69 million settlement loss in the income statement. The cash received on the settlement amounted to EUR 128 million.\n\n## UK\n\nIn the UK, the group operates a legacy defined benefit scheme providing benefits that are linked to the salary level near retirement age or an earlier date of leaving service. The scheme is closed both for new members and future accrual for old members. Part of the scheme is a defined contribution plan and is open to all current employees. The UK pension scheme operates under a single trust which is independent from the group.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn Germany employees within defined benefit arrangements are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on their service and final salary. All significant defined benefit plans are closed for new employees.",

The asset values of UK arrangements constitute 88% of total asset values in defined benefit plans within group.\n\n## Interest risk\n\nDiscount rates used in calculations are based on high-quality corporate bond yield curves in currency in which the benefits are paid. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan liabilities. The maturities of yields are reflecting the durations of the underlying obligations. The weighted average duration of group's defined benefit obligation is 14 years (18 years) at the end of 2022.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nIn the UK, the pensions in payment are tied to Retail Price Index whilst being tied to Consumer Price Index during deferment. An increase of 0.5% in indexes will increase the liabilities by some EUR 15 million. In Germany the pensions have to be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n180\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe present value of the net retirement benefit assets and liabilities is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the salary of the plan participants would increase the plan liabilities. In the UK, the changes in salary levels have no impact on the funding position as all defined benefit arrangements in the UK are closed to future accrual. In Germany, an increase of 0.5% in expected future salaries would increase the obligation by EUR 7 million.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nAdjustments in mortality assumption have an impact on group's defined benefit obligation. An increase in life expectancy by one year will increase the obligation in the UK by EUR 11 million and in Germany by EUR 16 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nSeveral actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the defined benefit plans.

The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the term of the related pension liability. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement as employee costs so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs and gains or losses on settlement are recognised immediately in income when they occur.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, contributions are paid to pension insurance companies. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no further payment obligations. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide post-employment medical and other benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to healthcare benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Valuations of these obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n182\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## 4.

The investment includes new production lines, new workspaces and 720 square metres of completely new production space. The investment will be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nIn January 2020, UPM announced that it would invest in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2023, and the total investment estimate is EUR 750 million.\n\nIn January 2019 UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment will be completed in Q1 2023.\n\nIn July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest in port operations in Montevideo and in local investments outside the mill fence. The mill is scheduled to start up by the end of Q1 2023, and the total investment estimate is USD 3.47 billion.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n183\n\nIn October 2019 UPM announced that it would invest EUR 95 million in a Combined-Heat-Power (CHP) plant at the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany. The plant was connected to the grid in Q3 2022.\n\n## Capitalised borrowing costs\n\nIn 2022, the borrowing costs capitalised as part of non-current assets amounted to EUR 20 million (9 million). Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs was EUR 1 million (2 million) and the average interest rate used 0.79% (0.73%), which represents the average costs to finance the projects. In 2022, capitalised borrowing costs were mainly related to the construction of the new pulp mill in Uruguay.\n\n## Government grants\n\nIn 2022, government grants recognised as deduction of non-current assets totalled to EUR 15 million (0 million). Grants relate mainly to the biochemicals biorefinery investment in Leuna.",

Due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all property, plant and equipment as well as operating assets and uninsured receivables locating or relating to operations in these countries.\n\nIn December 2021, UPM conducted an impairment test of UPM Communication Papers fixed assets. The costs of pulp, recycled fibre, logistics and energy increased significantly in 2021 and high production costs continue to challenge the operations in the foreseeable future. Fair value less cost to sell method was used in the calculation with an inflation rate of 2.0%, negative sales growth rate of 5.4% in real terms, and a post-tax discount rate of 6.7%. As a result of the test calculation, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 50 million related to newsprint property, plant and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. Costs of assets of acquired in business combinations are determined at fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment charges, if any. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet represents the cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\nMajor renovations are capitalised and depreciated over the useful lives of the related asset. Ordinary expenses for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.\n\n| ASSESSED USEFUL LIVES             | NUMBER OF YEARS   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Land, not subject to depreciation | -                 |\n| Buildings                         | 20-50             |\n| Power plants                      | 20-30             |\n| Heavy machinery                   | 15-20             |\n| Light machinery                   | 10-15             |\n| Equipment                         | 5                 |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n184\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nCarrying values of individual items included in property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. The carrying value is written down immediately to the asset's recoverable amount if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).\n\nNon-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount will not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe estimations of useful lives, residual value as well as depreciation and amortisation methods require significant management judgement and are reviewed annually. Management makes estimates on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations.\n\nThe long useful lives of assets, changes in estimated future sales prices of products, changes in product costs and changes in the discount rates used could lead to significant impairment charges.\n\nEstimates are also made in an acquisition when determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2  Forest assets\n\nUPM is both a major forest owner and a purchaser of wood.

At the end of 2022, carrying value of own forest land amounted to EUR 736 million (EUR 694 million) and leased forest land EUR 243 million (EUR 219 million).\n\nUPM's own and leased forest land areas are summarised in below table.\n\n|                      | PRO-     | PRO-                  | PRO-           |\n|----------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|                      | FOREST   | DUCTIVE  FOREST  LAND | FORESTED  LAND |\n| 1,000 ha             | LAND 522 | 430                   |                |\n| Finland Uruguay      | 305      | 182                   | 422 176        |\n| Uruguay, leased land | 167      | 136                   | 130            |\n| United States        | 76       | 55                    | 55             |\n| Total                | 1,070    | 802                   | 783            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests, which are recognised as forest assets at fair value less costs to sell, and land. Own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n185\n\nAny changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows considering existing, sustainable harvesting plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices, harvesting and silviculture costs and selling expenses. The fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation\n\nThe valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group's forest assets.\n\nMain factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. Stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management's estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 100 years for forests in Finland and in the US and up to 10 years for plantations in Uruguay. The cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. Felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group's projection of future price and costs development. In addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Finnish forests in 2022 was 8.0% (7.0%) and for Uruguayan plantations 11.0% (9.9%). A decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately EUR 257 million (270 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3 Energy shareholdings\n\nUPM is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. The majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group's pulp and paper production. The production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which UPM has energy shareholdings. Energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. UPM does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies.\n\nThe value of energy shareholdings amounted to EUR 3,652 million (2,579 million) at the end of 2022. These energy companies supply energy or both energy and heat to their shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle energy and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nIn 2020, UPM issued a shareholder loan of EUR 47 million without a maturity date to PVO. Embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the PVO B2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. The loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the PVO B2 series valuation. In addition, in 2020 UPM issued a similar loan commitment of EUR 123 million to PVO, where also a right to issue new PVO B2 shares is embedded starting from 2023. The commitment matures at the end of 2023.",

The B and B2 series relate to PVO's shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). UPM has no direct shareholdings in TVO. TVO operates two nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto 2) and is constructing one new nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto (Olkiluoto 3), Finland. Olkiluoto 3 has proceeded to its test production phase. The operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, European Union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. Pursuant to the Finnish Nuclear Liability Act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. Shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the Nuclear Liability Act. In Finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund). The contributions to the Fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. These contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings.\n\n## Changes in energy shareholdings\n\n| EURm                                                            | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                    | 2,579  | 1,936  |\n| Disposals                                                       | -2     | -1     |\n| Changes in fair value recognised in other  comprehensive income | 1,074  | 643    |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                                  | 3,652  | 2,579  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through OCI. The shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. Purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. Initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. Upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings.\n\nThe fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n186\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation and sensitivity\n\nValuation of energy shareholdings requires management's assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates.\n\nThe electricity price estimate is based on future electricity forward prices and a simulation of the Finnish area electricity price. A change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by EUR 390 (370) million. The discount rate of 7.13% (5.08%) used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. A change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately EUR 230 (330) million.\n\nOther uncertainties and risk factors in the value of the assets relate to start-up schedule of the fixed price turn-key Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant project. UPM's indirect share of the capacity of Olkiluoto 3 EPR is approximately 31%, through its PVO B2 shares. Changes in regulatory environment or taxation also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets. For example, temporary profit tax on the electricity sector applicable in 2023 according to Finnish Government's law proposal.\n\n## 4.4  Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe group's goodwill mainly relates to pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay belonging to UPM Fibres business area. In 2022, the group's goodwill and other intangible assets increased mainly as a result of the company acquisition of AMC AG in UPM Raflatac business area.

In pulp operations the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices and the cost of wood raw material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group's assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement.\n\nWhile management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. Actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Future cash flows\n\nThe review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. The most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. The group is using ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group's business is long-term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. In estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following seven years are taken into consideration. In addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. In the projection of cash flows UPM uses EBITDA adjusted with cash flows not captured within EBITDA, including working capital movements and capital expenditures.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n188\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. The adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the CGU operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination.\n\n## Intangible rights\n\nIntangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. Water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants.\n\nThe values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. Other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (CGUs), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a business area. The carrying amount for the CGU includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the CGU unit\n\nexceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nOther intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount. The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\n## 4.5  Provisions\n\n1\n\n| EURm                                | RESTRUCTURING   | TERMINATION   | ENVIRON- MENTAL   | EMISSIONS   | OTHER   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 2022                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 24              | 36            | 30                | 39          | 26      | 155     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 5               | 11            | 11                | 69          | 21      | 117     |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -12             | -23           | -1                | -54         | -30     | -121    |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -3              | -2            | -11               | -           | -2      | -18     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -               | -             | -                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Translation differences             | -               | -             | -                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 14              | 22            | 29                | 53          | 15      | 134     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 64      |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 70      |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 134     |\n| 2021                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 52              | 91            | 29                | 21          | 28      | 222     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 5               | 6             | 2                 | 41          | 11      | 64      |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -22             | -53           | -1                | -21         | -10     | -107    |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -11             | -8            | -1                | -2          | -2      | -25     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -               | -             | -                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Translation differences             | -               | -             | -                 | -           | -       |         |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 24              | 36            | 30                | 39          | 26      | 155     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 68      |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 88      |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 155     |\n\nUPM has undergone several restructuring in recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programs. Restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. Termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. In Finland termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. Unemployment provisions in Finland are recognised 2-3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 and 2021, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in UPM Communication Papers business area. In 2022 and 2021, there were no significant additions to restructuring and termination provisions.\n\nThe group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a removal of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists. In 2022, the group recognised EUR 8 million additional environmental provision related to prior capacity closures in Finland.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n189\n\nOther provisions are mainly attributable to onerous contracts and will be incurred over a period longer than one year. In 2022, additions to other provisions include EUR 10 relating to tax dispute.\n\nProvisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. The group possesses emission rights amounting to EUR 235 million (104 million) as intangible assets.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights.",

Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\n## Restructuring and termination provisions\n\nA restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. Employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. The recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. Such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. Provisions do not include any third-party recoveries.\n\n## Emission provisions\n\nEmission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. The provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. In case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually.\n\nThe group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. However, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group's operations.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nManagement judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation. Provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, an unfavourable outcome is probable and the amount of loss\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n190\n\nBUSINESSES\n\ncan be reasonably estimated. Due to inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 9.2 Litigation for details of legal contingencies.\n\n## 4.6  Working capital\n\nThe group defines operating working capital as inventories, trade receivables, trade payables and advances received which are presented separately below. The performance obligations related to advances received are typically fulfilled within 12 months of receipt of the advance. UPM is focusing on working capital efficiency and targeting a sustainable and permanent reduction in operating working capital.\n\n## Operating working capital\n\n| EURm              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Inventories       | 2,289  | 1,594  |\n| Trade receivables | 1,614  | 1,320  |\n| Trade payables    | -1,855 | -1,697 |\n| Advances received | -23    | -14    |\n| Total             | 2,026  | 1,204  |\n\n## Inventories\n\n| EURm                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 1,128  | 794    |\n| Work in progress              | 11     | 6      |\n| Finished products and goods   | 1,116  | 769    |\n| Advance payments              | 34     | 25     |\n| Total                         | 2,289  | 1,594  |\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\n| EURm                                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade receivables                       |        |        |\n| Trade receivables                       | 1,647  | 1,345  |\n| Loss allowance provision                | -32    | -25    |\n| Total trade receivables                 | 1,614  | 1,320  |\n| Prepayments and accrued income          |        |        |\n| Personnel expenses                      | 2      | 5      |\n| Interest income                         | 1      | 0      |\n| Energy and other excise taxes           | 15     | 20     |\n| Other items                             | 158    | 175    |\n| Total prepayments and accrued income    | 176    | 200    |\n| Other receivables                       |        |        |\n| VAT and other indirect taxes receivable | 326    | 166    |\n| Cash collaterals                        | 500    | 292    |\n| Other receivables                       | 80     | 47     |\n| Total other receivables                 | 906    | 504    |\n| Total                                   | 2,696  | 2,024  |\n\n## Trade receivables ageing\n\n|                        | 2022               | 2022                       | 2022                                   | 2021               | 2021                       | 2021                                   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| EURm                   | TRADE  RECEIVABLES | LOSS  ALLOWANCE  PROVISION | TRADE  RECEIVABLES,  NET OF  PROVISION | TRADE  RECEIVABLES | LOSS  ALLOWANCE  PROVISION | TRADE  RECEIVABLES,  NET OF  PROVISION |\n| Undue                  | 1,471              | -1                         | 1,470                                  | 1,005              | -5                         | 1,000                                  |\n| Past due up to 30 days | 114                | -1                         | 114                                    | 314                | -1                         | 313                                    |\n| Past due 31-90 days    | 19                 | -3                         | 16                                     | 6                  | -1                         | 5                                      |\n| Past due over 90 days  | 42                 | -28                        | 14                                     | 20                 | -19                        | 2                                      |\n| Total                  | 1,647              | -32                        | 1,614                                  | 1,345              | -25                        | 1,320                                  |\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\n| EURm                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Accrued expenses and deferred income       |        |        |\n| Personnel expenses                         | 184    | 191    |\n| Interest expenses                          | 21     | 9      |\n| Indirect taxes                             | 17     | 13     |\n| Customer rebates                           | 130    | 119    |\n| Customer claims                            | 7      | 6      |\n| Other items                                | 169    | 111    |\n| Total accrued expenses and deferred income | 528    | 449    |\n| Advances received                          | 23     | 14     |\n| Trade payables                             | 1,855  | 1,697  |\n| Other current liabilities                  | 314    | 94     |\n| Total                                      | 2,720  | 2,254  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational credit risk\n\nOperational credit risk is defined as the risk where UPM is not able to collect the payments for its receivables. The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding trade receivables, days of sales outstanding (DSO) and overdue trade receivables are followed on monthly basis. Potential concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables are limited due to the large number and the geographic dispersion of customers. Customer credit limits are established and monitored, and ongoing evaluations of their financial condition is performed. The group has trade credit insurances to protect accounts receivables from significant credit losses. In certain market areas, including Asia and Northern Africa, measures to reduce credit risks include letters of credit, prepayments and bank guarantees. Maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any credit enhancements, is the carrying amount of trade and other receivables.\n\nUPM does not have significant concentration of customer credit risk. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 17% (15%) of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2022 - i.e., approximately EUR 269 million (200 million).\n\nIn 2022, trade receivables amounting to EUR 2 million (5 million) were subject to permanent write-off and the loss was recognised under other costs and expenses. In accordance with the group's accounting policy, trade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. In addition, due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, the group increased the general provision for expected credit losses on trade\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n191\n\nreceivables, and impaired inventories and other receivables. As at 31 December 2022, the credit loss provision related to operations in Russia was EUR 8 million, impairment related to inventories EUR 10 million and impairment related to other receivables EUR 5 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the method most appropriate to the particular nature of inventory, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for inventory obsolescence.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade receivables arising from selling goods and services in the normal course of business are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowance provision. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of 14-60 days, which is consistent with market practice.\n\nThe group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. The group has recognised two types of provisions for trade receivables - a general provision for lifetime expected credit losses and a provision for specified individual trade receivables, both of which are charged to the income statement. The group uses a provision matrix for estimating lifetime expected credit losses where trade receivables are segregated by businesses. The provision matrix is based on historical observed default rates, adjusted by forward looking information. It takes into account trade credit insurances, payment profile of customers and the factor that as debts get older they are more likely not to be paid. Additionally, the group recognises a provision individually for outstanding trade receivables where specific debtor information is available. In these cases there must be objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.\n\nTrade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The customer entering into bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or finalising such proceedings, or entering into debt-restructuring are considered indicators that the trade receivables are no longer expected to be recovered.

        "page_content": "recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the receivables.\n\nOther receivables consist mainly of cash collaterals pledged for commodity contracts and interest rate futures. The fair value equals to the amount of cash pledged as collateral. The cash collaterals cover the counterparties' losses in case UPM is unable to meet its obligations.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade payables arise from purchase of inventories, fixed assets and goods and services in the ordinary course of business from UPM's suppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if they are due to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business or within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables.\n\nThe group is recognising refund liability for expected volume and other discounts arising from contracts with customers. Customer rebates include mainly volume discounts and are recognised as equal to an amount which is most likely to be paid to the customer. The carrying amount of expected customer rebates is updated at each reporting date, using the latest forecast data available.\n\nCustomer claims relating to quality complaints are accounted for as revenue related refund liability. Expected customer claims are estimated based on historical data and the amount of refund liability is updated at each reporting date. Customer claims and customer rebates are typically expected to realise within the next 12 months.\n\nAdvances received are recognised as contract liability until the performance obligation is fulfilled.\n\n## 5.  Capital structure\n\nUPM has a strong cash flow and industry-leading balance sheet that mitigates risks and enables value-enhancing strategic actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.1  Capital management\n\nUPM's objective for managing capital comprising of net debt and total equity is to ensure maintenance of flexible capital structure to enable the ability to operate in capital markets and maintain optimal returns to shareholders. The group manages its financing activities, debt portfolio and financial resources via various policies that are designed to ensure optimum financing arrangements minimising simultaneously financial expenses and refinancing risk and optimising liquidity. Borrowing activities are centralised to the parent to the extent possible and cash resources are distributed within the group by the central treasury department.\n\nUPM targets a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 times or less.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n192\n\n## UPM's capital\n\n| EURm                                                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of the parent  company          | 12,502 | 10,846 |\n| Non-controlling interest                                      | 376    | 261    |\n| Total equity                                                  | 12,879 | 11,106 |\n| Non-current debt                                              | 4,476  | 2,566  |\n| Current debt                                                  | 558    | 86     |\n| Total debt                                                    | 5,034  | 2,652  |\n| Total capitalisation                                          | 17,913 | 13,759 |\n| Total debt                                                    | 5,034  | 2,652  |\n| Less: Interest-bearing financial assets and  investment funds | 2,660  | 2,006  |\n| Net debt                                                      | 2,374  | 647    |\n| Gearing ratio, %  1)                                          | 18     | 6      |\n| Net debt to EBITDA  1)                                        | 0.94   | 0.35   |\n\n1) Refer \u00bb Other financial information on Alternative performance measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing risk\n\nUnder all circumstances, UPM seeks to maintain adequate liquidity, which depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of cash flows from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing. UPM aims to ensure sufficient liquidity by means of efficient cash management and restricting financial investments to investment types that can readily be converted into cash and by keeping a sufficient amount of unused committed credit lines or cash as a reserve. UPM aims to minimise refinancing risks by ensuring a balanced loan portfolio maturing schedule and sufficiently long maturities. The average loan maturity at 31 December 2022 was 4.6 years (7.3 years).\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing\n\n| EURm                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at bank                       | 1,632  | 1,313  |\n| Cash equivalents                   | 434    | 146    |\n| Investment funds                   | 1      | 100    |\n| Committed credit lines             | 5,709  | 909    |\n| of which used                      | -1,378 | -      |\n| Loan commitments                   | -123   | -123   |\n| Used uncommitted credit lines      | -444   | -2     |\n| Long-term loan repayment cash flow | -94    | -77    |\n| Liquidity                          | 5,738  | 2,267  |\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at banks and with original maturities of three months or less.

In 2022, net debt increased by EUR 1,728 million. Net debt totalled EUR 2,374 million (647 million) at the end of 2022. Net debt has been impacted by energy hedging derivative market value payments, which are driven by the increase in energy futures prices and volatility in the energy markets\n\nIn October 2020 UPM established a EUR 3 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and launched a Green Finance Framework. The independent second opinion concerning the framework was provided by CICERO Shades of Green. UPM's framework was rated with the highest-grade, CICERO Dark Green. In May 2022, UPM successfully issued its third Green Bond under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme and Green Finance Framework. The EUR 500 million bond matures in May 2029 and pays a fixed coupon of 2.25%. There are no financial covenants connected to this or the previously issued bonds. The net proceeds from the bonds are used for financing and/or refinancing Eligible Projects and Assets under UPM's Green Finance Framework. All issued euro bonds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin.\n\n## Net debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n195\n\n| EURm                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bonds                               | 1,974  | 1,624  |\n| Loans from financial institutions   | 1,604  | 213    |\n| Lease liabilities                   | 583    | 504    |\n| Derivatives                         | 137    | 23     |\n| Other loans                         | 179    | 201    |\n| Non-current debt                    | 4,476  | 2,566  |\n| Repayments of non-current debt      | 9      | 7      |\n| Repayments of lease liabilities     | 84     | 70     |\n| Derivatives                         | 24     | 8      |\n| Other liabilities                   | 441    | 2      |\n| Current debt                        | 558    | 86     |\n| Total debt                          | 5,034  | 2,652  |\n| Loan receivables                    | 4      | 4      |\n| Derivatives                         | 61     | 126    |\n| Other receivables                   | 19     | 19     |\n| Non-current interest-bearing assets | 84     | 148    |\n| Loan receivables                    | 0      | 3      |\n| Derivatives                         | 9      | 4      |\n| Other receivables                   | 500    | 292    |\n| Investment funds                    | 1      | 100    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 2,067  | 1,460  |\n| Current interest-bearing assets     | 2,576  | 1,858  |\n| Total interest-bearing assets       | 2,660  | 2,006  |\n| Net debt                            | 2,374  | 647    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt comprising of bonds, bank and pension loans, lease liabilities and other loans is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the estimated life of the borrowing. UPM classifies debt as non-current unless due for settlement within a year. Most of the debt is hedged in a fair value hedge relationship as described in \u00bb Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\n## Accounting policies",

Approximately 34% (36%) of leased assets recognised on the balance sheet consists of land areas in Uruguay, which the group uses for eucalyptus plantations. Approximately 24% (30%) of the leased assets on the balance sheet consist of five power plants. UPM uses the energy generated by these plants for its own production. In addition, the group has leased one waste water treatment plant as well as several warehouses, terminals, offices, railcars and vessels. UPM also leases some production machinery and equipment like forklifts and vehicles that are insignificant to the total leased assets portfolio.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n198\n\nIn 2022, additions to lease assets relate mainly to biochemicals refinery utilities in Leuna and new vessels for sea transportation in Europe. Impairment charges in 2022 relate to assets impacted by the Russia's war in Ukraine. Due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all leased assets locating or relating to operations in these countries.\n\nIn 2022, the total cash outflow for leased assets was EUR 91 (84) million. The expenses related to short-term leases recognised in the income statement in 2022 amounted to EUR 3 (3) million. The group had no significant variable lease payments in 2022.\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at year-end 31 December 2022 totalled approximately EUR 245 (409) million, which are mostly related to long-term charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany.\n\n## Changes in leased assets\n\n3\n\n|                                        | LAND AREAS   | BUILDINGS   | MACHINERY  AND  EQUIPMENT   | OTHER LEASED  ASSETS   | ADVANCE  PAYMENTS  1)   | TOTAL   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| 2022                                   |              |             |                             |                        |                         |         |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January           | 252          | 264         | 80                          | 8                      | 4                       | 608     |\n| New contracts and subsequent additions | 24           | 18          | 127                         | -                      | 8                       | 178     |\n| Business acquisitions                  | -            | -           | -                           | -                      | -                       | -       |\n| Reassessments and disposals            | 8            | -           | -8                          | -                      | -                       | -       |\n| Depreciations                          | -16          | -34         | -29                         | -                      | -                       | -80     |\n| Impairments                            | -            | -3          | -7                          | -2                     | -                       | -12     |\n| Reclassifications                      | -            | -           | 5                           | -5                     | -                       | -1      |\n| Translation differences                | 15           | 2           | 1                           | -                      | -                       | 18      |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December         | 283          | 247         | 169                         | 1                      | 13                      | 713     |\n| 2021                                   |              |             |                             |                        |                         |         |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January           | 214          | 245         | 86                          | 12                     | 4                       | 561     |\n| New contracts and subsequent additions | 30           | 47          | 13                          | 5                      | 4                       | 98      |\n| Reassessments and disposals            | 4            | -1          | -                           | -                      | -                       | 3       |\n| Depreciations                          | -13          | -31         | -21                         | -8                     | -                       | -74     |\n| Impairments                            | -            | -           | -                           | -                      | -                       | -       |\n| Reclassifications                      | -            | 2           | -                           | -                      | -2                      | -       |\n| Translation differences                | 18           | 2           | 2                           | -                      | -                       | 21      |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December         | 252          | 264         | 80                          | 8                      | 4                       | 608     |\n\n1) Advance payments for leases not commenced at the year end reporting date 31 December.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Leases\n\n## The group as a lessee\n\nUPM assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the exercise of judgment about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether UPM obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether UPM has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe group recognises a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases. UPM applies this to all asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is not a short-term lease. UPM recognises lease payments of short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease term is determined as the non- cancellable period of the lease taking into consideration the options to extend and terminate if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. If the contract is for an indefinite period of time and the group and the lessor both have a right to terminate the contract within a short notice period (12 months or less) without a significant economic penalties and termination cash payments, the contract is considered to be a short-term.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at the commencement date and measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid during the lease term. The group uses, as a basis, discount rate implicit in the lease and if that rate cannot be readily determined, UPM uses\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n199\n\nincremental borrowing rate which comprises of currency and lease termbased reference rate and specific credit spread as well as other specific terms and conditions of a lease. Lease payments can include fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate and extension option payments or purchase options if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise them. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and remeasured (with corresponding adjustment to the related leased asset) when there is a change in future lease payments due to renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or reassessment of options.\n\nLeased asset comprises the initial lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligations to refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The leased asset is subsequently valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Remeasurement takes place in case lease liability is remeasured and change in cash flows is based on contract terms that have been included in the original contract. The leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. The leased asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment, as for own assets.\n\nThe group has elected to separate non-lease components such as service components and other variable components and account them for as expenses, if they can be separated from the leased asset. However, the group does not separate non-lease components from the lease contracts of company cars.\n\nThe group does not apply portfolio approach of leases with similar characteristics.\n\nLeased assets are presented in the balance sheet as a separate financial statement line item. Lease liabilities are presented as part of non-current debt and current debt line items in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are part of net debt calculation of the group. Short-term lease payments are reported as rents and lease expenses. Variable lease",

If the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, it is considered to be a finance lease; if not, the lease is considered to be an operating lease.

The fair value of non-current loans amounted to EUR 3,607 million (2,573 million) at the end of 2022. For quoted bonds, the fair values are based on the quoted market value as of 31 December. At the end of 2022, all bonds were quoted.\n\nFor other non-current borrowings fair values are estimated using the expected contractual future payments discounted at market interest rates and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information on net debt and bonds.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n201",

They are measured at fair value and any gains or losses from subsequent measurement are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through OCI\n\nThis category includes mainly UPM's energy shareholdings. These assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis category comprises loan receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, as well as trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. They are included in non-current assets unless they mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Cash and cash equivalents are always classified as current assets. Loan receivables that have a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loan receivables without fixed maturity date are measured at amortised cost. As soon as a loan receivables or cash and cash equivalents are originated or purchased, a loss allowance for 12-month expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. If credit risk increases significantly, full lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. In the comparison period, loan receivables were impaired if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated recoverable amount. The credit loss model applied to trade receivables is described in \u00bb Note 4.6 Working capital .\n\n## Derivatives under hedge accounting\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognised in accordance with the accounting principles described in \u00bb Note 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt, trade payables and other financial liabilities. \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n202\n\nThe different levels of fair value hierarchy used in fair value estimation are defined as follows:\n\n## Fair values under level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Derivatives include futures and commodity forwards traded in exchange.\n\n## Fair values under level 2\n\nObservable inputs are used as basis for fair value calculations either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. For investment funds, the valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in markets that are not active. For derivatives, level 2 include OTC derivatives like forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest and currency swaps and commodity swaps. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments at level 2 include the following methods:\n\nInterest forward rate agreements (FRA) are fair valued based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued based on the contract forward rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency options are fair valued based on quoted market rates and market volatility rates on the balance sheet date by using the Black&Scholes option valuation model. Interest and currency swap instruments are fair valued as present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Commodity swaps are fair valued based on quoted forward prices on the balance sheet date.\n\nAn embedded derivative that is by nature a foreign currency forward contract is valuated at market forward exchange rates and is included in level 2.

Amounts are recycled only within equity upon the disposal of the asset.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred and the cost of hedging when recognised in OCI. Amounts are recognised in profit or loss when the associated hedged transactions affect profit or loss or as part of the acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment. In 2022, a gain of EUR 5 million (9) was reclassified from the hedging reserve to other financial income and expenses as a result of inefficiency.\n\n## Share-based payments reserve\n\nThe share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value at the grant date of the share incentive plans, Performance Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, over their vesting period.\n\n## Reserve for invested non-restricted equity\n\nReserve for invested non-restricted equity includes, under the Companies' Act, the exercise value of shareholders' investments in the company unless otherwise decided by the company.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nThis reserve includes the foreign currency differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and the effective result of transactions that hedge the group's net investments in foreign operations. There were no reclassifications from the translation reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency of net investment hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransaction costs directly relating to the issue of new shares or share options are recognised, net of tax, in equity as a reduction in the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the parent company's shares (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the parent company until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2022                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | -32                           | -84                                        | -1                 | 22    | -96     |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | 65                            | 401                                        | 4                  | -94   | 376     |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | 24                            | -                                          | 1                  | -     | 25      |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | -15                           | -1,131                                     | -15                | 228   | -932    |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | 42                            | -814                                       | -11                | 155   | -627    |\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2021                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | 57                            | -26                                        | -2                 | -1    | 28      |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | -5                            | 85                                         | -1                 | -16   | 63      |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | -14                           | -                                          | -                  | -     | -14     |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | -70                           | -143                                       | 2                  | 38    | -172    |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | -32                           | -84                                        | -1                 | 22    | -96     |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n204\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.  Risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.1  Financial risk management\n\nThe objective of financial risk management is to protect the group from unfavourable changes in financial markets and thus help to secure profitability. The objectives and limits for financing activities are defined in the Group Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In financial risk management various financial instruments are used within the limits specified in the Group Treasury Policy. Only such instruments which market value and risk profile can be continuously and reliably monitored are used for this purpose.\n\nFinancing services are provided to the group entities and financial risk management carried out by the central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs a consequence of the global nature of its business, UPM is exposed to risks associated with changes in exchange rates, primarily with respect to USD, GBP and UYU. Foreign exchange risk arises from contracted and expected commercial future payment flows (transaction exposure), changes in value of recognised assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and changes in the value of assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries (translation exposure). The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to limit the uncertainty created by changes in foreign exchange rates on the future value of cash flows earnings and in the group's balance sheet. Changing exchange rates can also have indirect effects, such as change in relative competitiveness between currency regions.\n\n## Transaction exposure\n\nThe group hedges transaction exposure related to highly probable future commercial foreign currency cash flows on a rolling basis over the next 12-month period based on forecasts by the respective business areas. Transaction risk arises from the changes in currency rates of highly probable transactions, which are expected to take place in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The group's policy is to hedge an average of 50% of its estimated net risk currency cash flow. Some highly probable cash flows have been hedged for longer than 12 months ahead while deviating from the risk neutral hedging level at the same time. At 31 December 2022, 51% (49%) of the forecast 12-month currency flow was hedged.\n\nThe group enters into external forward contracts, which are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk of specific future foreign currency flows. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied when possible. If hedge accounting is not possible, fair value changes of the hedging instrument are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of 2022, UPM's estimated net risk currency flow for the next 12 months was EUR 2,291 million (1,886 million).\n\nThe weighted hedging rate by currency against EUR were USD 1.05, UYU 46.18 and GBP 0.87.\n\nIn addition to commercial foreign currency flow, the group has hedged risk currency flow related to investments. Cash flow or fair value hedge accounting is applied. At the end of 2022 the hedged net risk currency flow was EUR 141 million (EUR 360 million).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n205\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n12 months net risk currency flow and hedges 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nm\n\nR\n\nU\n\nE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Translation exposure\n\nThe group has several currency denominated assets and liabilities on its balance sheet such as foreign currency bonds, loans and deposits, group internal loans and cash in other currencies than functional currencies. UPM aims to fully hedge this balance sheet translation exposure, however, UPM might have unhedged balance sheet exposures within the limits set in group Treasury Policy.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the unhedged balance sheet exposures in net of interest-bearing assets and liabilities amounted to EUR 8 million (9 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nThe group has also accounts receivable and payable balances denominated in foreign currencies and UPM aims to fully hedge the net exposure in main currencies. The nominal values of the hedging instruments in net of accounts payable and receivable hedging were EUR 410 million (352 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nUPM's net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency translation differences. The exchange rate differences arising from translation of foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of equity in the translation reserve relate mainly to USD, CNY and GBP. Currency exposure arising from the net investment in foreign subsidiaries is generally not hedged. However, at 31 December 2022, part of the foreign exchange risk associated with the net investments was hedged, major ones in China and Uruguay, and net investment hedge accounting has been applied.

Exchange rate fluctuations have therefore minor or no effects on profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 The position includes foreign currency forward contracts that hedge commercial flows or investments and are part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on equity.\n- \u00b7 The position includes also foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on profit.\n- \u00b7 The position excludes foreign currency denominated future cash flows and effects of translation exposure and related hedges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe interest-bearing liabilities and assets expose the group to interest rate risk, namely repricing and fair value interest rate risk caused by interest rate movements. According to the Group Treasury Policy the interest rate exposure is defined as the difference in interest rate sensitivity between assets and liabilities compared to a benchmark portfolio with a 6-month duration. The total interest rate exposure is a net debt portfolio which includes all interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives that are used to hedge the aforementioned balance sheet items. The policy sets risk limits and allowed deviation from target net debt duration level. UPM has decided to deviate from its policy target and extend the duration of net debt. At 31 December 2022 the duration of net debt was 45 months. The group uses interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate futures and cross currency swaps, to change net debt duration.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n206\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nThe table below shows the nominal value of interest rate position exposed to interest rate risk in each significant currency. The position includes all cash balances, investment funds, interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives used to hedge these items. The positive/ negative position indicates a net liability/asset position by currency and that the group is exposed to repricing and/or fair value interest risk by interest rate movements in that currency.

However, the possible ineffectiveness has an effect on the profit of the year.\n- \u00b7 Cash balances are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Investment funds are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Leasing transactions are excluded.\n- \u00b7 Fixed rate debt that is measured at amortised cost and is not designated to fair value hedge relationship is not subject to interest rate risk sensitivity.\n- \u00b7 Floating rate debt that are measured at amortised cost and not designated as hedged items are included in interest rate sensitivity analysis.\n- \u00b7 Changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives (interest rate futures, swaps and cross currency swaps) that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting affect the financial income or expenses (net gains or losses from remeasurement of the financial assets and liabilities to fair value) and are therefore included in the income-related sensitivity analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity price risk\n\nUPM is hedging the price of electricity consumption and production. Electricity prices rely on weather, fossil fuel and emissions allowance prices as well as the balance of supply and demand. The group's sensitivity to electricity market price is dependent on the electricity production and consumption levels and the hedging levels. The inherent price risks arise from the daily sales and purchases of electricity from the power market with spot prices, and the hedging objective is to reduce the earnings volatility that arises from electricity prices.\n\nUPM considers Nordic system and electricity price area differential (EPAD) for Finland products perfect hedges for corresponding electricity price risk components in Finland. The components of electricity price risk in the Nordic power market are hedged by entering into System and EPAD electricity derivative contracts, mostly Nasdaq Commodities futures and bilateral forwards. System and EPAD prices are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable risk components in electricity sales and purchase contracts as well as in the hedging instruments, as a quoted price is available. Fair value changes of designated system and EPAD derivatives are offsetting electricity sales and purchase price changes. The share of system component covers approximately 80-90% and the share of EPAD component covers 10-20% of the changes in electricity sales and purchase prices.\n\nThe electricity price risk in the Central European power market is hedged by entering into European Electricity Exchange futures. Products used for hedging hedge the entire price risk for the underlying price area.\n\nThe time frame hedged has historically been approximately rolling 5 years. Hedging level has been typically higher for the nearest years and lower for the latter years. Hedging level for a certain year has historically varied between 0-80%. UPM constantly updates its electricity production and consumption forecasts. Hedging level is calculated based on the most recent available information about the electricity production and consumption forecast.\n\nThe group applies cash flow hedge accounting for the hedging relationships when it hedges its electricity price risk. In small amounts, the group is also trading electricity forwards and futures. As well as hedging, proprietary trading risks are monitored on a daily basis. Value-At-Risk levels are set to limit the maximum risk at any given time. Cumulative maximum loss is limited by stop-loss limits.\n\n## Electricity derivatives price sensitivity\n\nSensitivity analysis for financial electricity derivatives is based on position at the end of financial year. Sensitivities change over time as the overall hedging and trading positions change. Underlying physical positions are not included in the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is calculated separately for the hedge accounted and nonhedge accounted volumes. In the analysis it is assumed that forward quotation in Nasdaq Commodities and EEX would change EUR 5/ MWh throughout the period UPM has derivatives.\n\n| EURm                                             | EFFECT   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| +/- EUR 5/MWh in electricity  forward quotations |          |        |        |\n| Effect on profit before tax                      | +/-      | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Effect on equity                                 | +/-      | 93.0   | 115.9  |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n207\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.2  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe group uses financial derivatives to manage currency, interest rate and commodity price risks.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value gain or loss is recognised through the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and on the nature of the item being hedged. Certain derivatives are designated at inception either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge), or hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries with other than the EUR as their functional currency (net investment hedge). Derivative fair values on the balance sheet are classified as non-current when the remaining maturity is more than 12 months and as current when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, UPM documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception date. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions. The group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nCertain derivatives, while considered to be economical hedges for UPM's financial risk management purposes, do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are recognised at fair value through the income statement in other operating income or under financial items.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Cost of hedging, meaning forward points of derivative forward contracts accounted as cash flow hedges, is recognised as a part of the hedging reserve. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement and classified as income or expense in the same period as that in which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the forecast external sale to the group that is hedged takes place).\n\nWhen the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a fixed asset, gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the committed or forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. However, if a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised to the income statement.\n\nIn currency cash flow hedging, the hedging instrument is made in the same currency as the hedged item and hence the fair value change of the hedging instrument are expected to effectively offset the fair value",

        "page_content": "changes generated by the hedged items. Thereby the hedge ratio between the instrument and the cash flow is 1:1. Ineffectiveness may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness can also occur in a situation where the hedging instrument with an appropriate maturity is not available in the market for the whole duration of the hedged item. Then the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item don't fully match, which causes minor ineffectiveness. There are no other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nIneffectiveness in electricity price hedges may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness may also arise in case EPAD prices remained negative for a longer period of time, but considering historical price development UPM considers this scenario to be highly unlikely.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe fair value changes of forward exchange contracts used in hedging net investments that reflect the change in spot exchange rates are recognised in other comprehensive income within translation reserve. Any gain or loss relating to the interest portion of forward exchange contracts is recognised immediately in the income statement under financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\nThe hedging instrument is always made in the same currency as the hedged investment, hence the hedge ratio in net investment hedging is 1:1. For hedging of net investments, ineffectiveness may only arise in the highly unlikely situation where the hedged item is disposed or sold during the duration of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that are prospectively highly effective are recorded in the income statement under financial items, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. The carrying amounts of hedged items and the fair values of hedging instruments are included in interest-bearing assets or liabilities.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n208\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nDerivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges mature at the same time as hedged items. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the expected period to maturity.\n\nIneffectiveness in fair value hedge of fixed interest risk may arise in case of early redemption of such debt, which is hedged under fair value hedge accounting. The group has not recognised other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting also for hedging firm commitment of a purchase in foreign currency. The currency changes of the hedging instrument are recorded through profit and loss in financial items, until they are recognised as a part of the acquisition cost of a fixed asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial counterparty risk\n\nThe financial instruments the group has agreed with banks and financial institutions contain an element of risk of the counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. According to the Group Treasury Policy derivative instruments and investments of cash funds may be made only with counterparties meeting certain creditworthiness criteria. The group minimises counterparty risk also by using a number of major banks and financial institutions. Creditworthiness of counterparties is constantly monitored by Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n## Effect of IBOR reform and significant assumptions\n\nGroup's risk exposure that is directly affected by the IBOR reform is fair value hedge accounting of long-term fixed-rate debt for changes in fair value attributable to USD LIBOR which is the current benchmark interest rate. USD LIBOR is currently expected to be published until June 2023. Group currently has only few contracts which reference USD LIBOR and extend beyond June 2023. Group oversees the IBOR transition and follows ISDA and other market guidelines on effects of these changes to UPM's contracts. In fair value hedging relationships, fair value for both the hedged item and hedging instrument is calculated with identical rate. Therefore no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\n## Net fair values of derivatives\n\n|                                           | Positive fair  values   | Negative fair  values   | Net fair values   | Positive fair  values   | Negative fair  values   | Net fair values   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| EURm                                      | 2022                    | 2022                    | 2022              | 2021                    | 2021                    | 2021              |\n| Foreign exchange risk                     |                         |                         |                   |                         |                         |                   |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts        |                         |                         |                   |                         |                         |                   |\n| Cash flow hedges                          | 67                      | -34                     | 33                | 21                      | -53                     | -31               |\n| Net investment hedge                      | 2                       | -2                      | -

In 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate was affected by the income not subject to tax from subsidiaries operating in tax free zone and German tax rate that is higher than in Finland. In 2021, effective tax rate was also impacted by tax exempt capital gain on the sale of shares of Shotton Mill Ltd.\n\n## Income tax\n\n| EURm                     |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax expense      |    344 |    273 |\n| Change in deferred taxes |     44 |    -32 |\n| Total                    |    388 |    240 |\n\n## Tax rate reconciliation\n\n| EURm                                              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                 | 1,944  | 1,548  |\n| Computed tax at Finnish statutory rate of 20%     | 389    | 310    |\n| Difference between Finnish and foreign rates      | 62     | -16    |\n| Tax-exempt income                                 | -99    | -90    |\n| Non-deductible expenses                           | 11     | 6      |\n| Withholding taxes                                 | 0      | 4      |\n| Tax loss with no tax benefit                      | 19     | 18     |\n| Results of associates                             | -1     | 0      |\n| Change in tax legislation                         | 1      | 2      |\n| Change in recoverability of deferred tax assets   | 9      | 13     |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses | -9     | -3     |\n| Other items                                       | 7      | -3     |\n| Total income taxes                                | 388    | 240    |\n| Effective tax rate, %                             | 19.9 % | 15.5 % |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on the taxable result for the period based on the tax rules prevailing in the countries where the group operates and includes tax adjustments for previous periods and withholding taxes deducted at source on intra-group transactions. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity or as part of other comprehensive income. In these instances, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the group's tax expense and income tax liabilities\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n211\n\ninvolves a degree of estimation and judgement. Tax balances reflect a current understanding and interpretation of existing tax laws. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and adjusts income tax liabilities where appropriate.\n\nThe Finnish Government has published in December 2022 the law proposal for a temporary profit tax on the electricity sector. The proposed tax would be 30% of the companies' net profits generated from the electricity business in Finland in fiscal year 2023 exceeding 10% annual return on shareholder's equity of the electricity business (in addition to standard 20 % corporate income tax rate on profits generated from electricity operations). According to the proposal, internal electricity business profits would not be taken into account when calculating the taxable net profit for the temporary profit tax. UPM Energy is the second largest electricity producer in Finland and in the scope of the proposed temporary profit tax. The tax would become payable in early 2024. However, the financial impact would depend on the results of the electricity business and energy market development.\n\nIn December 2022, EU member states reached agreement to implement at EU level the minimum taxation component, known as Pillar 2, of the OECD's reform of international taxation. The entities in scope will be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between their GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. The EU currently has plans to implement the rules in member states in 2023 with an effective date for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 2023. The rules have no impact on current or deferred taxes for financial reporting period ending on 31 December 2022 as Pillar 2 requirements have not been substantively enacted in any of the territories in which it operates. UPM is currently evaluating Pillar 2 requirements and legislation in the jurisdictions that are likely to be impacted.\n\n## 7.2  Deferred tax\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                  |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | 86     | 83     | 77     |\n| Inventories                                          | 86     | 53     | 38     |\n| Retirement benefit liabilities and provisions        | 88     | 127    | 156    |\n| Other temporary differences                          | 475    | 269    | 163    |\n| Tax losses and tax credits carried forward           | 167    | 230    | 157    |\n| Offset against liabilities                           | -417   | -297   | -170   |\n| Total                                                | 485    | 466    | 421    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | -335   | -261   | -245   |\n| Forest assets                                        | -423   | -398   | -352   |\n| Retirement benefit assets                            | -2     | -17    | -5     |\n| Other temporary differences                          | -294   | -217   | -132   |\n| Offset against assets                                | 417    | 297    | 170    |\n| Total                                                | -636   | -596   | -564   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                | -151   | -130   | -143   |",

At 31 December 2022, net operating loss carry-forwards for which the group has recognised a deferred tax asset amounted to EUR 584 million (802 million), of which EUR 514 million (717 million) was attributable to German subsidiaries. In Germany net operating loss carry-forwards do not expire. In other countries net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates and in varying amounts. Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe assumptions regarding future realisation of tax benefits, and therefore the recognition of deferred tax assets, may change due to future operating performance of the group, as well as other factors, some of which are outside of the control of the group.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe net operating loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax is recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation amounted to EUR 890 million (843 million) in 2022. These net operating loss carry-forwards are mainly attributable to certain German and French subsidiaries and do not expire. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards relating to closed Miramichi paper mill due to only minor operations in Canada. These loss carry-forwards expire at different times by the end of 2029.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n212\n\nThe group has not recognised deferred tax liability in respect of undistributed earnings of non-Finnish subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax liability for the undistributed earnings of Finnish subsidiaries and associates as such earnings can be distributed without any tax consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is calculated based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the taxable values of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that it is probable that these can be utilised against future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised net where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.  Group structure\n\n## 8.1 Business acquisitions and disposals\n\nIn 2022, UPM sold its 33,09 % holding in the associated company Encore Ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6palvelut Oy, and made several minor sales of equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI. In 2021, UPM permanently closed paper production at its Shotton newsprint mill site in North Wales, United Kingdom. The site and all related assets were sold to Eren Paper Ltd, a subsidiary of Modern Karton Sanayi Ve Ticaret A. \u015e ., the containerboard and corrugated packaging business of the Turkish industrial conglomerate Eren Holding ('Eren'), thereby closing the transaction announced in May 2021. Net cash arising from disposal was EUR 157 million and gain on disposal was EUR 133 million. UPM also made several minor sales of equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI.\n\nIn 2022,  UPM made a minor investment in ASK Altpapier Sortierung Kinsau GmbH by acquiring the full share capital of of the company, and made several minor investments in equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI. In 2021, UPM purchased an additional 20.23% share in the joint operation Alholmens Kraft, increasing UPM's ownership from 29.77% to 50.00 %. UPM also made a minor investment in InfraLeuna GmbH which is an equity investment accounted at fair value through OCI.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nOn 15 September 2022, UPM Raflatac completed the acquisition of AMC AG (Advanced Methods of Coating). The acquisition announced in May 2022 was closed after regulatory clearances. AMC AG employs more than 300 people and has two production sites in Northern Germany, in Kaltenkirchen and in Hagenow. UPM Raflatac expects to realize significant synergies through the acquisition.\n\nIf the transaction had occurred on 1 January 2022, UPM's sales for January-December 2022 would have been EUR 11,794 million and profit for the period EUR 1,558 million. These amounts have been calculated using the Group's accounting policies and by adjusting the results of the subsidiaries to reflect the depreciation, amortisation and expenses that would have been charged assuming application of fair value adjustments to other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and inventories from 1 January 2022, together with the consequential tax effects.\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition is mainly attributable to the expected synergies and skilful assembled workforce. Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:\n\n| EURm                         |     |\n|------------------------------|-----|\n| Cash paid                    | 150 |\n| Total purchase consideration | 150 |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n213\n\n| EURm                                             |   15 SEP 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Customer relationships                           |            42 |\n| Trademarks                                       |             9 |\n| Technology                                       |            11 |\n| Other intangible assets                          |             0 |\n| Property, plant and equipment                    |            56 |\n| Leased assets                                    |             0 |\n| Inventories                                      |            20 |\n| Trade and other receivables                      |            22 |\n| Income tax receivables                           |             0 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        |            12 |\n| Total assets                                     |           172 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                         |            26 |\n| Non-current debt                                 |            20 |\n| Current debt                                     |             2 |\n| Trade and other payables                         |            10 |\n| Income tax payables                              |             2 |\n| Total liabilities                                |            60 |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                 |           112 |\n| Net assets belonging to non-controlling interest |             0 |\n| Goodwill arising from acquisition                |            38 |\n\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables included trade receivables with a fair value of EUR 21 million.

Acquisition related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nand contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The group made contributions of EUR 6 million (6 million) to the defined benefit sections of the Scheme in 2022. The fair value of the UK defined benefit fund assets at 31 December 2022 was EUR 300 million (565 million), of which 5% was invested in equity instruments, 26% in debt instruments, 20% in property, 44% money market and 5% in other investments.\n\nAt the end of 2021, pensions for about 21% of the group's Finnish employees were arranged through the TyEL foundation, UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6, which is a separate legal entity. In 2022, the foundation was replaced with defined contribution arrangement and the assets and liabilities of the plan were transferred to the insurance company. In 2022, the contributions paid by UPM to the TyEL foundation amounted to EUR 0 (18) million. Cash received from settlements amounted to EUR 128 million. The fair value of foundation assets at 31 December 2022 was EUR 0 (597) million.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n216\n\nNo assets were classified as held for sale at the end of 2022 or 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, if UPM will recover their carrying amount through a sale transaction which is considered highly probable. Non-current assets classified as held for sale, or included within a disposal group that is classified as held for sale, are not depreciated after the classification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.\n\n## Unrecognised items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.1  Commitments and contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, UPM enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties. The maximum amounts of future payments for which UPM is liable is disclosed in the table below under 'Other commitments'. Property under mortgages given as collateral for own commitments include property, plant and equipment, industrial estates and forest land.\n\n| EURm                                                                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| On behalf of others                                                    |        |        |\n| Guarantees                                                             | 2      | 2      |\n| Other own commitments                                                  |        |        |\n| Leasing commitments for the next 12 months in  accordance with IFRS 16 | 2      | 4      |\n| Other commitments                                                      | 219    | 213    |\n| Total                                                                  | 223    | 220    |\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at the end of 2022 totals approximately EUR 245 million, which are mostly related to longterm charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related to waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany. Such lease commitments at the end of 2021 amounted to EUR 409 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.2  Litigation\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe group is defendant or plaintiff in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations. These lawsuits primarily involve claims arising from commercial law issues.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe Group's management is not aware of any significant litigation at the end of 2022.\n\nIn October 2021, the European Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at UPM's premises. According to the Commission's press release on 12 October, the Commission has concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. The Commission states that the unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in an investigation into suspected\n\nanticompetitive practices, and the fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. UPM takes any suspected violation of antitrust rules very seriously and has a compliance programme in place to mitigate the risk of such violations. For example, all employees and executives are required to take training on the UPM Code of Conduct, which includes a section regarding antitrust compliance. In addition, UPM has also in place a specific training programme regarding antitrust rules which covers approximately 3,000 employees and executives.\n\n## 9.3  Events after the balance sheet date\n\nOn 2 February 2023, UPM's Board of Directors revised the company's dividend policy to be based on earnings instead of cash flow. This aligns the dividend policy with the company's transformative growth strategy. According to the new policy, UPM aims to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time.\n\n## 10. Other notes\n\n## 10.1 Forthcoming new standards, amendments and accounting policy changes\n\nCertain new accounting standard amendments and interpretations have been published that come into effect only after the reporting period started on 1 January 2022. These standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions and have not been early adopted.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n217",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the parent company financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of the parent company are prepared in accordance with Finnish Accounting Standards, FAS. The main differences in accounting policies of the group and the parent company relate to the measurement of financial derivatives and forest assets and recognition of defined benefit obligations, share-based payments, lease agreements and deferred income taxes.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in millions of euros and rounded and therefore the sum of individual figures might deviate from the presented total figure.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date and other commitments are translated into euro currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Exchange rate differences arising from the valuation of trade receivables are recognised in sales and exchange rate differences on trade payables in purchases. Exchange differences arising from the measurement of other receivables and liabilities are recognised in financial items.\n\n## Tangible and intangible assets\n\nTangible and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortisation according to plan and impairments. Emission rights are recognised using net approach. Depreciation and amortization according to plan is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nLand and water areas, no depreciation\n\n| Intangible assets             | 5 - 10 years   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                     | 20 - 50 years  |\n| Light machinery and equipment | 5 - 10 years   |\n| Heavy machinery               | 15 - 20 years  |\n| Power plants                  | 20 - 30 years  |\n| Other tangible assets         | 5 - 20 years   |\n\nForest assets are recognised as tangible assets within land and water areas at historical cost and revaluation. No systematic depreciation or changes in value due to felling is recognised.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are stated at cost less impairments.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or the lower of replacement cost and probable selling price. Costs are measured using FIFO-method. In addition to variable costs, the cost of inventories includes a portion of the fixed costs of acquisition and manufacturing.\n\n## Revaluations\n\nThe balance sheet value of land includes revaluations. No new revaluations are made and the balance sheet value of land is considered to be below their fair value.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\n\n222\n\n## Leases\n\nLease payments of lease contracts are recognised in other operating expenses over the lease term. Lease payments due in future years under lease contracts are presented as off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions include foreseeable future expenses and losses to which the company is committed, the realization of which is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated, e.g. pension and environmental liabilities and termination and restructuring costs. Changes in provisions are recognised in income statement within particular cost items.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales include sales revenue from actual operations less indirect taxes, discounts, claims and exchange rate differences on net cash flow hedges and trade receivables.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). The mandatory pensions are arranged mainly through pension insurance companies. Contributions to pension insurance companies are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. Pension obligations of own pension funds are fully funded.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShare based compensation is recognized as an expense in the income statement over the earnings period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.\n\n## Closing entries\n\nParent company closing entries consists of the change in the depreciation difference and group contributions granted to group companies. The accumulated depreciation difference in the parent company has not been divided into equity and deferred tax liability.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes presented in the income statement consist of accrued taxes for the financial year and tax adjustments for prior years. The parent company has not recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but presents the information in the notes.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nRealised results of derivative contracts and negative fair value of open derivative contracts are recognised in the income statement. Negative fair value of open derivative contracts that are not settled in cash is recognised as a provision in the balance sheet. Hedge accounting is not applied. Income and expenses of balance sheet hedging and forward foreign exchange contracts hedging commercial foreign currency flow of group companies are recognised in financial items. Income and expenses of commodity derivatives are recognised in operating profit. Income and expenses of commodity derivative contracts of group companies are recognized in financial items.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nMajority of financial derivative contracts of the group are made by the parent company. All contracts are made with external counterparties except internal derivatives which are used to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposure.\n\nFinancial risks, fair values and maturities of the group external derivatives are disclosed in \u00bb Note 6.1 Financial risk management and in \u00bb Note 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\n## Service charges from group companies\n\nThe classification of service charges from group companies has been changed in the income statement of UPM-Kymmene Corporation during the fiscal year. Some of the service income previously presented in UPM-Kymmene Corporation's income statement as 'Other operating expenses' as netting items are now presented as 'Other operating income' in the income statement. In 1 January - 31 December 2021, the reclassified income totalled EUR 57 million. The service income subject to reclassification relate to services that are internally produced by the entity and are further charged from group companies. These charges are now presented in Other operating income which describes the nature of the activity more precisely.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe classification of derivative contracts of group companies has been changed in the income statement of UPM-Kymmene Corporation during the fiscal year. The provision on unrealised negative fair value and realised result of forward foreign exchange contracts hedging commercial foreign currency flow of group companies were previously presented in 'Sales'. Provision for unrealised negative fair value and realised result of commodity derivatives of group companies were previously presented in 'Materials and services'. These derivatives are now presented in the income statement in 'Financial income and expenses'.\n\nThe income statement and notes to the financial statement of the comparison year 2021 are now changed to reflect the classification changes. These changes do not have any effect to equity or the balance sheet. This accounting policy change's effect to income statement in 2021:\n\n| EURm                           | Note   | Published  1.1.-31.12 .2021   |   Changes | Adjusted  1.1.-31.12 .2021   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|\n| Sales                          | 1      | 2,554                         |       -12 | 2,542                        |\n| Materials and services         |        | -1,757                        |       262 | -1,505                       |\n| Financial income and  expenses |        | 281                           |      -251 | 30                           |\n| Profit for the period          |        | 469                           |         0 | 469                          |\n\n## 1.

2022\n\n230\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Auditor's Report (Translation of the Finnish Original)\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of UPM-Kymmene Corporation\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Opinion\n\n## In our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's financial position and financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU\n- \u00b7 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company's financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of UPM-Kymmene Corporation (business identity code 1041090-0) for the year ended 31 December 2022. The financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies\n- \u00b7 the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.3 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Overall group materiality: \u20ac 95 million, which represents approximately 5 % of the the profit before tax.\n- \u00b7 The group audit scope encompassed all significant group companies, as well as a number of smaller group companies in Europe, Asia, North America and South America covering the vast majority of revenue, assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of forest assets\n- \u00b7 Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 95 million (previous year \u20ac 77 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | Approximately 5% of the profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose profit before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which the performance of the Group is commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted  benchmark. We chose approximately 5%, which is within the range of acceptable quantitative  materiality thresholds in auditing standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the UPM-Kymmene Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the group. Selected specified procedures as well as analytical procedures were performed to cover the remaining group companies.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matter in the audit of the group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of forest assets\n\nRefer to note 4.2. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe group owns and leases total of a 1 070 thousand hectares of forests and plantations in Finland, the United States and Uruguay. The value of the forest assets, i.e. standing trees, amount to \u20ac 2 442 million at 31 December 2022. Forest assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows. Young saplings and land are valued at cost. Main factors used in the valuation are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nIn testing the valuation of forest assets, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodologies adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n\n-\n\n- Assessed the discount rates applied in the valuation;\n- -Assessed the other key valuation assumptions; and,\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as stumpage price, trend price forecast, tree growth assumptions, consumer price index and inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nRefer to note 4.3. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe energy shareholdings amounted to \u20ac 3 652 million at 31 December 2022. The energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments in energy companies and are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable. The fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis. The main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends, discount rates, the start-up schedule of the nuclear power plant unit Olkiluoto 3, and the temporary profit tax on the electricity sector applicable in 2023 according to Finnish Government's law proposal.\n\nIn testing the valuation of the energy shareholdings, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodology adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the future electricity prices and price trends;\n- -Assessed the discount rate applied in the valuation;\n- -Validated the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit start-up schedule against the most recent available information;\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as production costs and volumes, UPM's ownership percentages, inflation, tax rate and net debt.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nWe have no key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Reporting Requirements\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe have been acting as auditors appointed by the annual general meeting since 30 April 1996. Our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 27 years. The Company arranged the latest audit tendering process in 2013. Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen has acted as the responsible auditor since 4 April 2019, representing a total uninterrupted period of four years.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. In our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements\n- \u00b7 the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Other Statements\n\nWe support the proposal that the financial statements are adopted.
