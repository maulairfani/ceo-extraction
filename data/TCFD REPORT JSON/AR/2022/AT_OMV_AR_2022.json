But what really matters is the future.'\n\n## A conversation with Alfred Stern, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of OMV\n\n- \u25b8 More information is available in the video by Alfred Stern in our online report www.reports.omv.com/en/annual-report/2022\n\n## Mr. Stern, what's the first things that come to your mind when you think about 2022?\n\nFirst of all, I share the disbelief of everyone at the Russian attack on Ukraine. I clearly see the pain that it causes every day. I also think about the fact that, in February 2022, OMV swiftly reacted to this unprecedented situation and tackled the various consequences - thanks to our employees, who were still dealing with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and had to throw themselves straight into the next challenge. That deserves huge respect. But I don't want the entirely new direction and transformation of our Company to get lost in all of that. We initiated this path during the difficult environment of the previous year and have been following it consequently ever since.\n\n## Was it immediately clear what had to be done regarding Russia?\n\nFor us, there was no option but to immediately reevaluate our entire Russian business in line with the sanctions. We removed Russia from our core regions, and decided to make no further investments there. Additionally, we undertook value adjustments for our activities in Russia and conducted a strategic assessment of our shareholding in a natural gas field. We are considering all options in this regard, including sale and withdrawal, but we're also aware that doing that in the current legal environment is an extremely taxing endeavor. At the same time, however, we've also been focusing on securing the supply to our customers. We have succeeded in doing this by using alternative sources of supply, securing transport capacity, and pursuing a consistent storage strategy. The gas task force we set up for this purpose performed and continues to perform incredible work in this regard.\n\n## OMV's new strategic direction was almost overshadowed by the outbreak of war. Was it also superseded by the events?\n\nNot at all. We obviously had to make tactical adjustments, but the strategy was confirmed with all of its cornerstones. As a result of the war, it became clearer than ever that the world needed a new footing for its energy supply. With the importance of sustainability in mind, we need to reduce our use of resources, of fossil fuels, by replacing them with alternatives, and to find a quicker way to drive forward the circular economy. We describe in our Strategy how that might work, and implementing it is a top priority.\n\n## With the development of the Strategy 2030, you've also redefined OMV's very reason for being.\n\nWe have chosen a fundamentally different path, analyzed future global developments, and asked ourselves what OMV will look like in ten, twenty, or thirty years' time. The result is summarized in our purpose 'Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living': we see it as our duty to develop solutions to help us not only to ensure our quality of life, but more importantly to enable more people to share this sense of well-being with the smallest possible carbon footprint. Stemming from this aspiration, 2023 sees the establishment of our revised corporate structure and OMV's new strategic direction in all three business segments: the gradual replacement of fossil-based energy sources through sustainable operations in the new Energy business segment; the goal for the Fuels & Feedstock segment, as a leading provider of sustainable fuels and chemical feedstocks, to contribute to climate-friendly mobility and materials management; and for the Chemicals & Materials business to become both a world leading provider of special polyolefin solutions and a leading Company in the field of circular economy.",

Our industry is one of the key levers for a successful reversal of climate change.\n\nALFRED STERN Chairman of the Executive Board\n\n## There is also criticism. How do you convince people of the reliability of your strategy?\n\nFrom our point of view, there is no more meaningful path for OMV to take toward a sustainable future. The Energy business segment is proving its worth as the financial driver of our transformation. The sustainable direction of Fuels & Feedstock is taking shape. The same applies for Chemicals & Materials. We only presented the Strategy 2030 a year ago. Operationally, we've launched two promising geothermal projects in Austria and Germany and recently entered into an agreement to form a joint venture to develop the geothermal potential in the Vienna Basin. We've been able to celebrate initial success in terms of sustainable aviation fuels, are putting our ReOil \u00ae 2000 plant into operation in Schwechat with a processing capacity of 16,000 t this year, and are working on the global licensing of the technology. Also in Schwechat, Borealis is planning a further plant for advanced recycling, and this year we will complete the largest electrolysis plant in Austria, which will produce 1,500 t green hydrogen per year. Financially, we are in a very strong position to invest in growth. By 2030, an average of 40 percent of our investments will be in sustainable projects. All of this shows that we are consistently taking the path we have chosen.\n\n## Geopolitical tension and climate change are placing OMV increasingly in the spotlight of public interest. How do you handle this?\n\nThe significance of energy companies has taken on a whole new dimension. Our industry is one of the key levers for a successful reversal of climate change. At the same time, we need to help ensure a secure and affordable energy supply - now more than ever in the wake of the Russian attack on Ukraine. If we want to fundamentally realign a company under these conditions, we need not just a few but all stakeholders on board - no matter whether they're owners, the capital market, the procurement or sales market, employees, prospective employees, politicians, the media, or the general public.",

        "page_content": "## The current environment is generating high profits, which are controversially being referred to as 'excess profits.' What's your opinion?\n\nThe 2022 business year was an exceptionally successful one and the generated returns will need to be deployed in a focused manner: on the one hand for a secure energy supply in the future, but predominantly also for the sustainable, successful development of the Company over the long term. That requires enormous investment in research, development, and innovative production processes. Of course, we also want our shareholders to participate appropriately in the success of the Company. That's why we will propose OMV's highest ever regular dividend of EUR 2.80 to the Annual General Meeting this year, and on-top of that a special dividend of EUR 2.25. In order to ensure an appropriate participation also over the long term, we have modified our dividend policy and introduced the special dividend as an additional instrument. With this modified dividend policy we aim to distribute approximately 20 to 30 percent of the cash flow from operating activities including net working capital effects, if sufficient funds are available and the Company's leverage ratio is below 30 percent.\n\n## You described the Chemicals & Materials business as the future growth driver of OMV. What makes you so sure of this despite the current weak market?\n\nThe market will grow, especially considering the increasing number of people living in economic prosperity. At the same time, we need to keep an eye on dwindling resources and the ever-growing threat to the climate. And this is where our C&M business will play a key role, through the accelerated development and production of high-quality, sustainable chemical and plastic products, which ensure the efficient use of resources and increase energy efficiency of solar panels, wind farms, electricity transmission, and mobility solutions - to name just a few examples. Furthermore, we will make use of OMV and Borealis' expertise in the area of mechanical and chemical recycling of plastics in order to take a leading role in the global circular economy. We need to succeed in decoupling economic growth and consumption of resources. This will help to lower emissions and reduce waste. Overall, this offers enormous market potential that we want to capitalize on as much as possible.\n\n## A strategy has long-term targets. As the war on Ukraine shows, time and again, unforeseen events have huge implications. How is it possible to know at all times that you're on the right path?\n\nThat's very true. As a company, you also need to be able to act on developments at short notice. A well thought out strategy provides the necessary scope and flexibility to do this. The OMV strategy has proven itself in this regard over the past twelve months. At the same time, however, we must never lose sight of the overarching goal, and that is and will remain simultaneously addressing the climate crisis and the ever-increasing consumption of energy and resources. This demands new solutions. For this reason, the long-term success of a company depends on its ability to harness sustainability as a driver of innovation and growth. We have made sustainability the starting point and the core element of our strategy, and therefore the foundation of our successful development.\n\nVienna, March 9, 2023\n\nAlfred Stern m.p.",

        "page_content": "## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe challenges posed by the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate became even more pronounced in 2022: on top of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic came the war in the Ukraine, a complex energy crisis and the highest rate of inflation for 70 years. Thanks to our new strategy, we've set the course for a sustainable future and already taken the first steps in this transformation. At the same time, however, the environment demanded short-term tactical adjustments in order to be able to best secure the supply of energy. I personally believe OMV management and employees did an extraordinary job balancing these different priorities.\n\nDuring this time of uncertainty, both the Company's ability to react quickly to changing circumstances and its high degree of diversification have once again been proven to be important. While in the Refining & Marketing business segment high refining margins led to a record result, the high energy prices in the chemical sector combined with a decline in demand had a negative impact. Bolstered by high oil and gas prices, the Exploration & Production segment was able to make a significant contribution to the overall performance of the Company. All of this led to the best result in the history of OMV.\n\nWe want to allow our shareholders to also benefit from this strong result and the stable financial situation. For this reason, we promised a special dividend of EUR 2.25 per share during the course of the 2022 financial year, and fundamentally expanded our dividend policy to include a special dividend instrument. For you, dear shareholders, this means that we will be proposing a total dividend of EUR 5.05 per share to the Annual General Meeting for the previous financial year.\n\nAs a Supervisory Board, our key priorities include the strategy, succession planning for Executive Board level, governance topics, and the approval of larger investment projects. I'm able to report positive developments in all of these areas. Below, I would like to inform you about the Supervisory Board's work during the 2022 financial year. After having initially focused predominantly on the strategy, we then moved on to the topics of corporate structure and management ( Strategy, Structure, People ).\n\n## Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nIn December 2021, the Supervisory Board approved the new strategy. Because the key points of this strategy require different skill sets and as we strive to achieve more diversity and internationality in general, a few amendments were made to the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, a new organizational structure for the Group came into force - the business segments are now divided into Fuels & Feedstock, which includes refining, marketing, and trading, Chemicals & Materials, which comprises the entire chemicals value chain, and Energy, meaning the traditional exploration, production, and gas business, plus the low-carbon business. Several changes to the composition of the Executive Board had already been made in preparation for this new operating model:\n\nThe areas that were formerly the Refining and Marketing & Trading business segments were combined to form the new Fuels & Feedstock business segment. Elena Skvortsova, Executive Officer Marketing & Trading, left OMV's Executive Board at the end of October 2022 by mutual agreement. At the meeting of October 27, 2022, the Supervisory Board tasked Martijn van Koten, who had previously headed the Refining segment, with also leading the Marketing & Trading business segment from November 2022 as a result of the consolidation to form the new Fuels & Feedstock segment from January 2023. As a manager, Martijn van Koten has an extraordinary wealth of international experience in the refining and chemicals businesses, and places a strict focus on the market and customers.\n\nIn November 2022, the Supervisory Board appointed external candidate Daniela Vlad as the new Executive Board member in charge of the Chemicals & Materials business segment, which was previously led by Executive Board Chairman Alfred Stern. She has been in this position since February 1, 2023. Daniela Vlad is a manager with many years of international experience in the chemicals business and in leading strategic transformations. She brings chemical and financial expertise and experience in the field of sustainable technical solutions, which are indispensable for profitable growth with emphasis on sustainability and innovation.\n\nFinally, at their meeting on December 13, 2022, the Supervisory Board appointed Berislav Gaso as Executive Board member for the Energy business segment, effective from March 1, 2023. On the same day, Johann Pleininger handed in his resignation with effect from the end of 2022. To bridge the two-month gap, the Supervisory Board entrusted Reinhard Florey with running the Energy agenda. Berislav Gaso is a proven energy expert with extensive international experience of major transformations, and takes responsibility for exploration and production activities in 13 countries.",

The decisions taken around strategy, structure, and management will pave the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nMARK GARRETT Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\nThere were also changes to the Supervisory Board in 2022. At the Annual General Meeting of June 3, 2022, Edith Hlawati, Robert Stajic, and Jean-Baptiste Renard were elected to the Supervisory Board. Christine Catasta, Christoph Swarovski, and Cathrine Trattner resigned from the Supervisory Board. Edith Hlawati took on the role of the first Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThere was one change to the employee representatives during 2022. Mario Mayrw\u00f6ger was elected as successor to Gerhard Singer on the Supervisory Board with effect from June 7, 2022.\n\n## Supervisory Board activities\n\nThe Supervisory Board carried out its activities during the financial year with great care and in accordance with the law, the Company's Articles of Association, and the Internal Rules. It oversaw the Executive Board's governance of OMV and advised it in decision-making processes on the basis of detailed written and verbal reports as well as constructive discussions between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board.\n\nFollowing the Supervisory Board sign-off, the Executive Board presented the Strategy 2030 at the Capital Markets Day in March. The aim of the strategy is for OMV to evolve into an integrated provider of sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials with a strong focus on solutions for the circular economy, and to achieve its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Sustainability and Transformation Committee of the Supervisory Board, founded at the end of 2021, got to work in 2022. During four meetings, it addressed topics related to ESG, with the focus naturally being on climate issues. The committee supports and oversees the transformation toward a more sustainable business model.\n\nAs Chairman of the Supervisory Board of a listed company, I really value discussions with, and feedback from, investors. After two years of only being able to hold virtual meetings because of COVID-19, it was such a pleasure to combine those virtual sessions with meetings in person with our large institutional investors, a voting rights consultant, and two climate-protection-related associations of investors in Frankfurt and London in December 2022 as part of a Governance Roadshow. The feedback we received reinforced our commitment to our transformation strategy and confirmed our focus on ESG topics.\n\nAs in the past, training specifically designed for the Supervisory Board took place in 2022. The Supervisory Board's annual self-assessment, based on surveys, was supported by an external consultancy firm. The results are used to help decide which issues and activities to prioritize in 2023.",

Furthermore, it focused on the issue of long-term Executive Board succession planning.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee handled the updates to the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board, also taking into account feedback from the capital markets. It also discussed and agreed on the contractual conditions for the new members of the Executive Board, and the termination agreements for the Executive Board members who resigned.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2022, in addition to being presented with the Remuneration Reports for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, shareholders were able to vote on the revised Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board. In this policy, the performance criteria and all variable remuneration elements had been adjusted according to the new Strategy 2030, and ESG criteria were more strongly weighted.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee looked at important topics related to accounting processes, the internal audit program, risk management, and the Group's internal control system. The OMV Group's long-standing annual auditor, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., was present at every meeting of the Audit Committee with one exception - the meeting that took place as part of the selection process for the Group's auditor where other auditing companies were presenting to the committee. At the ordinary Annual General Meeting in 2023, the election of a new auditing company will be on the agenda.\n\nMeetings of the Portfolio and Project Committee are held regularly prior to the meetings of the Supervisory Board. The committee used its meetings in 2022 to prepare decisions regarding key investment and M&A projects on the basis of extensive information and intensive discussions.\n\nThe newly formed Sustainability and Transformation Committee met four times in 2022. Its tasks include overseeing the strategy in terms of sustainability, ESG standards, performance, and processes, including HSSE and climate protection in particular.\n\nFurther details regarding the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees can be found in the (Consolidated) Corporate Governance Report.",

Both the Annual Financial Statements and the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for 2022 received an unqualified opinion from the auditing company Ernst & Young Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. The Supervisory Board also approved the (Consolidated) Corporate Governance Report reviewed by both the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee as well as the (Consolidated) Report on Payments Made to Governments.

The remaining amount of the net profit after the dividend distribution will be carried forward to new account. The Supervisory Board will review the separate consolidated non-financial report (Sustainability Report) individually, and this report will be published separately after the Annual Report together with the corresponding Supervisory Board report.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees for their commitment and extremely successful work in the 2022 financial year, which was marked by so much uncertainty. I would like to give special thanks to OMV's shareholders for their continued trust as well as to all of OMV's customers and partners.\n\nVienna, March 9, 2023\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nMark Garrett m.p.",

        "page_content": "## OMV on the Capital Markets\n\n2022 was a difficult year for global equities. High inflation, the Ukraine war, and Chinese COVID-19 lockdowns were the main culprits. Oil and gas stocks strongly outperformed the market, mainly due to high commodity prices. While OMV fared better than the ATX and the wider European market, it lagged behind its peers, weighed down by concerns triggered by the Ukraine war.\n\n## Financial markets\n\nHigh inflation rates, the Ukraine war, and China's zeroCOVID-19 policy were the main reasons why the performance of European equities was exceptionally weak in 2022. With the global MSCI World Index and Europe's STOXX 600 down 18% and 13% respectively according to Bloomberg, the yearly performance was the worst since the global financial crisis in 2007/2008.\n\nFixed income could not help in the same way as it often does when equities are down. The high inflation rate drove central banks around the world to hike interest rates. The resulting tighter liquidity and raised volatility negatively affected bond market performance. On the flip side, interest on traditional 'risk-free' savings accounts recovered in such a way that they are once again an attractive investment vehicle for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIn a comparison of all sectors, energy equities performed best in Europe and the United States. This was mainly a consequence of surging energy prices, which were principally caused by supply concerns fueled by the war in Ukraine.\n\nOn the crude oil side, the strength of the Brent price in the first half of 2022, driven by strong demand and\n\nRussian supply concerns, turned into a gradual decline mid-year that lasted through the remainder of the year. This was caused by the interest rate hikes and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China, which weighed on demand. However, the 2022 average of the Brent price was clearly above that of the three respective prior years.\n\nBenchmark prices for natural gas spot trading at European hubs continued at a record-high level during most of 2022, with a surge to unprecedented levels toward the end of the summer. Prices were mainly driven by the fear of a supply shortfall during the winter heating season, as it was unclear whether European storage operators would receive sufficient volumes from Russia and whether it can potentially be replaced by deliveries from alternative sources like LNG and piped gas from Norway.\n\nOnly toward the end of the year did European natural gas spot prices recede back to normal levels, as it became clear that storage facilities would be filled sufficiently and a looming supply shortfall would most likely be averted. Added to that was the unusually mild weather at the beginning of winter and the perspective of expanding supply from sources other than Russia, with Germany's first LNG import terminal commencing operations in December.\n\n## At a glance\n\n|                                            |           |   2022 |   2021 | 2020   |   2019 | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of outstanding shares 1             | in mn     | 327.1  | 327    | 327.0  | 326.9  | 326.7  |\n| Market capitalization 1                    | in EUR bn |  15.7  |  16.3  | 10.8   |  16.4  | 12.5   |\n| Volume traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange | in EUR bn |   9.8  |  10.4  | 9.3    |   8.2  | 9.1    |\n| Year's high                                | in EUR    |  58.26 |  55    | 50.76  |  54.54 | 56.24  |\n| Year's low                                 | in EUR    |  36.02 |  32.74 | 16.33  |  39.32 | 37.65  |\n| Year end                                   | in EUR    |  48.1  |  49.95 | 33.00  |  50.08 | 38.25  |\n| Earnings Per Share (EPS)                   | in EUR    |  11.12 |   6.4  | 3.85   |   5.14 | 4.40   |\n| Book value per share 1                     | in EUR    |  58.55 |  47.41 | 42.02  |  39.8  | 36.44  |\n| Cash flow per share 2                      | in EUR    |  23.73 |  21.47 | 9.60   |  12.42 | 13.46  |\n| Dividend Per Share (DPS) 3                 | in EUR    |   5.05 |   2.3  | 1.85   |   1.75 | 1.75   |\n| Payout ratio 3                             | in %      |  45    |  36    | 48     |  34    | 40     |\n| Dividend yield 1                           | in %      |  10.5  |   4.6  | 5.6    |   3.5  | 4.6    |\n| Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 4           | in %      |   1    |  57    | (29)   |  36    | (25)   |\n\n- 1 As of December 31\n- 2 Cash flow from operating activities, based on total weighted average outstanding shares\n- 3 2022: as proposed by the Executive Board, subject to review by the Supervisory Board; subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting 2023.

With the subsequent outbreak of the Ukraine war, the stock lost almost a third of its value within less than three weeks. However, while having to change the consolidation method for its Russian operations, OMV could prove to investors that the company was able to continue to operate with high profits despite the changed circumstances. By early June, on the back of solid results and a higher dividend payment (EUR 2.30 per share), OMV's share price was back above EUR 55 each.\n\nIn the following weeks, the financial consequences of the technical incident at the Schwechat refinery in conjunction with the general natural gas supply insecurity\n\nin Europe and the natural gas trading difficulties created by the war in Ukraine led to a new downturn in OMV's share price, resulting in the year's low of EUR 36.02 on September 23.\n\nPersistent exceptional profitability, improving visibility regarding the supply of natural gas during the heating season, and the introduction of a new and additional special dividend option and the announcement of one helped the share price recover to the high forties during the final two months of the year.\n\nOMV's share price closed the year at EUR 48.10. The average daily trading volume of OMV shares in 2022 was 420,539 shares (2021: 451,538). At year end, OMV's total market capitalization stood at EUR 15.7 bn, compared to EUR 16.3 bn at the end of 2021.\n\n## OMV share price performance 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOMV's share price declined by 3.7% across 2022, thus showing a slightly better performance than the wider Euopean market (FTSE Eurotop 100: -7.1%) and a significantly better performance than the Vienna Stock Exchange's blue chip index ATX (-19.0%). However, the stock underperformed compared to the European oil and gas sector (FTSEurofirst 300 Oil & Gas +26.9%).\n\nAssuming dividend reinvestment, the total shareholder return for the year was 0.8%. Measured over a fiveyear period, OMV generated a better return. A EUR 100 investment in OMV stock at year end 2017 with continuous dividend reinvestment in further OMV stock would have grown by an average annual return rate of 2.7% to EUR 114 at year end 2022.",

Supervisory Board elections were also held.\n\nFor the upcoming Annual General Meeting (to be held May 31, 2023), the Executive Board will propose a regular dividend of EUR 2.80 per share, plus a special dividend of EUR 2.25 per share for 2022. This represents an annual increase of the regular dividend of 22%. Based on the total amount of dividends paid (regular plus special) of EUR 5.05 per share, the dividend yield calculated using the closing price on the last trading day of 2022 amounts to 10.5%.\n\n## Amended dividend policy\n\nOMV is committed to delivering an attractive and predictable shareholder return through the business cycle. According to its progressive dividend policy, OMV aims to increase its regular dividend every year or at least to maintain the level of the respective previous year.\n\nIn addition, OMV has added special dividends as a new, additional instrument to the existing dividend policy. If the leverage ratio is below 30%, OMV aims to distribute approximately 20-30% of the OMV Group's operating cash flow (including net working capital effects) per year to its shareholders through its regular dividend, as a priority, and additionally, if sufficient funds are available, through the new instrument of a special dividend. In case of a leverage ratio of 30% or higher, OMV's progressive regular dividend will be maintained, but no special dividend shall be paid.\n\n## OMV shareholder structure\n\nOMV's shareholder structure remained relatively unchanged in 2022 and was as follows at year end: 43.1% free float, 31.5% \u00d6sterreichische Beteiligungs AG (\u00d6BAG, representing the Austrian state), 24.9% Mubadala Petroleum and Petrochemicals Holding Company (MPPH), 0.4% employee share programs, and 0.1% treasury shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While Moody's did not take any rating action during 2022, Fitch confirmed OMV's A- rating and revised its outlook from 'negative' to 'stable' on March 28, 2022. Fitch's outlook revision reflects its expectations of OMV's strong financial performance based on its higher oil and gas price assumptions, and OMV's new strategy gradually focusing on chemicals and materials, as well as sustainable fuels. This was confirmed on October 14, 2022. Moody's confirmed its rating and outlook for OMV in early 2023.\n\n## Analyst coverage\n\nDuring 2022, the total number of sell-side analysts covering OMV's share increased to 22, up from 21 at the end of 2021. This development further improves the visibility of OMV in the financial community. AlphaValue and Bank Pekao joined the list of covering brokerages, while Concorde Securities discontinued coverage. The majority of recommendations are 'buy' or equivalent, with a share of 62% of all recommendations at the end of 2022. 'Hold' recommendations slightly decreased to 33% and there was one 'sell' recommendation (compared to 0 last year), representing a share of 5% of all recommendations. Following the share price development, the average target price for OMV decreased slightly to EUR 58.80 at the end of 2022, from EUR 59.83 per share a year earlier.\n\n## Investor Relations activities\n\nOMV's Investor Relations department continued the intensive dialogue with the capital market during 2022. The main event of the year was the presentation of OMV's new Strategy 2030 at a Capital Markets Day held virtually on March 16. In the days that followed, a multitude of virtual conversations took place, giving OMV's executives a chance to lay out the details of the new strategy to analysts and investors.\n\nBeginning in June 2022, easing pandemic restrictions allowed the gradual restart of a selection of in-person meetings with international investors, always in strict compliance with the respective health and safety regulations. In addition to these in-person meetings, the familiar routine of virtual meetings remained in place, reducing the time, costs, and carbon emissions of Investor Relations activities.\n\nIn December 2022, OMV organized a governance road show with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, both virtually and physically, in London and Frankfurt, continuing the dialogue with the governance experts of some of our largest shareholders.\n\nOverall, the Investor Relations department again fulfilled its mission to provide comprehensive insight into OMV's strategy and business operations to all capital market participants, thereby guaranteeing equal treatment of all stakeholders. In this way, OMV's Executive Board was able to continue the constant dialogue with investors and analysts in Europe, North America, and Asia throughout 2022, regardless of the restrictions imposed to control the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "## Market Outlook\n\nInflation and significant reductions in the availability of Russian commodities, especially natural gas, in Europe following the removal of almost all Russian supply to the region, were the key causes of a substantial increase in global energy prices in 2022, leading to the 'first global energy crisis' as described by the IEA. This has amplified the incentive for Europe to further diversify and decarbonize its energy supply. High prices, in particular for gas and electricity, have put the focus back on security of supply.\n\n2022 was something of a watershed year in energy markets. Consumers and central banks across the globe were faced with the challenge of rapidly rising inflation already at the end of 2021 and the early part of 2022, and this was before the picture was further complicated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. Significant reductions in the availability of Russian energy, especially natural gas, in Europe following the removal of almost all Russian supply to the region were the key causes of a substantial increase in global energy prices in 2022. Energy commodities ended up being one of the few asset classes to post gains during 2022, as inflation and subsequent rapid interest rate hikes by central banks saw a broad-based sell-off of riskier assets and the long bull market in equities came to an end.\n\nThe developments in energy markets during 2022 have been described as the 'first global energy crisis' by the IEA's Fatih Birol. With natural gas in Europe averaging at several times its value from the last few years, the incentive for Europe in particular to further diversify and decarbonize its energy supply has been amplified. This urgency was reflected in the political landscape of 2022. The RePowerEU program and the Inflation Reduction Act in the US in particular will provide significantly expanded provision and financial support for the build-out of clean energy over the coming years.\n\nThe goal of achieving net zero emissions by the middle of the century has never been shared by more governments and corporations. As of the end of 2022, countries representing more than 90% of global GDP had made a commitment to net zero emissions. An increase of 10 percentage points compared to the end of 2021, according to the University of Oxford's Net Zero Tracker. Emissions coverage has increased by an estimated 6 percentage points to 83%, compared to 2021. While this trend is encouraging, the hurdles to achieving these goals remain significant.\n\nIn particular, the events of 2022 and the accompanying high prices, especially for gas and electricity, have put the focus back on security of supply. Europe's natural gas infrastructure is being rapidly retooled to shift from a high dependency on pipeline imports of gas from the east to a\n\nmore diversified portfolio that includes much larger volumes of LNG from the global seaborne market. The urgency of ensuring basic supplies of energy to consumers and businesses took precedence over long-term decarbonization goals during 2022, and it is entirely possible that this will be the case again over the next couple of years. Associated trends, such as resurgent coal demand for power generation and subsequent higher emissions intensity, can also be expected to recur. At the end of 2022, policymakers were occupied with the question of how severe recessionary effects will be during 2023, especially in Europe, where many observers have pointed to an existential threat to the viability of the regional manufacturing base.\n\nNevertheless, over the medium and long term, OMV fully expects the structure of energy supply and demand to undergo drastic changes as efforts are made at varying speeds and with varying degrees of success to decarbonize electricity production, transport, industry, and other carbon-intensive sectors of the global economy. A viable path to a net zero global energy system by the middle of the century has to include a diverse range of technologies being employed in place of the traditional fossil and biomass energy sources. No single energy source should account for more than a quarter of total primary energy supply by 2050, according to the most recent update of the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.\n\nOn a global level, there remains a significant implementation gap - the difference between the combined pledges on emissions reductions and the actual measures that have been taken to achieve them. Compared to 2021, additional announced pledges on emissions reductions from India and Indonesia have served to reduce the perceived gap between announced pledges and a net zero energy system. However, major uncertainty remains. This is reflected in the range of modeled shares of the different energy sources in the IEA's most recent World Energy Outlook: By the end of this decade, oil and gas will supply only 46% of total global primary energy in the net-zero scenario (down from 53% in 2021). However, this number remains essentially unchanged in the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) by 2030, and falls only to 47% by the middle of the century.",

In these environments, the question of underinvestment in upstream oil and gas remains a pertinent one for the energy system as a whole. Various analyses have shown that capital expenditure in E&P has so far not responded to the marked increases in oil and gas prices observed since the depths of the pandemic-related sell-off in the middle of 2020 in the same way that was characteristic of previous commodity cycles.\n\n## World total primary energy supply\n\nIn EJ\n\n1\n\nSource: IEA World Energy Outlook 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite these factors long term assumptions remain largely unchanged. For example, the expectation that advanced economies will see the most notable negative growth trends for fossil fuels over the medium and long term remain in place. The EU sees faster declines in oil demand than any other large country or region except Japan in the IEA's projections. The CAGR of EU oil consumption for 2021-2030 is -2% in the STEPS, falling to -3.8% in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). China, the engine of global oil demand growth over the last two decades, sees a CAGR on oil demand of less than 1% up to 2030 even in the STEPS.\n\nIn addition to an entrenched demand-decline trend in the domestic market, the European refining industry is likely to face ongoing headwinds in the form of higher utility and fuel costs vs. the other refining hubs, especially those in the US and the Middle East. While these higher costs are to some extent offset by higher market prices for refined products, they are nevertheless expected to continue to weigh on European competitiveness. Meanwhile, consensus demand assumptions continue to imply an advantage in the market for players with petrochemical integration. It is notable that, even in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, oil demand for non-energy use falls by only 6% by 2050 vs. 2021 levels (vs. a decline of almost 80% for oil demand overall).\n\n## Global petrochemicals 1 demand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Chemical Market Analytics by OPIS, a Dow Jones Company 1 Ethylene and propylene\n\nOil demand for chemical production is expected to increase, primarily originating from rising demand in emerging markets and closely linked to GDP development. By 2030, oil demand for chemical production will rise by about 2% per year. Approximately 80% of chemical and plastic demand growth will be concentrated in emerging markets, mainly Asia, until 2030 and beyond. This region represents most of the global population growth and the corresponding potential for improving living standards. For mature markets such as Europe, North America, and Japan, demand growth is anticipated to remain healthy in the long term, in line with economic development, but growth rates are expected to slow.\n\nNote: In its 2022 World Energy Outlook, the IEA did not include the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which has been used as a reference point in the past by OMV. In terms of cumulative emissions for the global energy system, the SDS is most closely comparable to the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS).",

A stress case that sees a faster transition away from fossil fuels than that in the Sustainable Development Scenarioused in the 2021 IEA report, though not as aggressive as the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.

The Group aims to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050 for all three scopes of greenhouse gas emissions. By taking this path, OMV expects to deliver an operating cash flow excluding net working capital effects of around EUR 6 bn by 2025 and at least EUR 7 bn by 2030, a ROACE of at least 12%, and to grow the distributions to its shareholders. Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living is OMV's purpose. 1\n\nTo drive sustainable growth and innovation, starting with January 1 st , 2023, OMV reorganized its corporate structure in three business segments: Chemicals & Materials, Fuels & Feedstock, and Energy. Chemicals & Materials continues to cover the entire chemicals value chain, including responsibility for capturing value from the circular economy. Fuels & Feedstock combines the previously distinct Executive Board areas of Refining and of Marketing & Trading. The Energy segment includes the traditional Exploration & Production (E&P) business as well as the entire gas business and the new Low-Carbon business focused on geothermal energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS). As part of the introduction of the new corporate structure, Gas & Power Eastern Europe, which includes supply, marketing and trading of gas in Romania and Turkey and one gas-fired power plant in Romania, was transferred from Fuels & Feedstock to the Energy business segment.\n\n## Strategic cornerstones\n\nOMV's goal is to transform from an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company into a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials, leveraging opportunities in the circular economy. An integral part of the Group's strategy is its ambition to become a netzero emissions company by 2050 for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.

By 2030, OMV aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% and its Scope 3 emissions by 20%. The Group also aims to reduce its intensity in energy supply by 20% by 2030. This will be achieved by decreasing fossil fuel sales, increasing zero-carbon energy sales, increasing polyolefin recycling and sustainable feedstocks and products, as well as using neutralization measures such as CCS.\n\nThis path will enable OMV to deliver operating cash flow excluding net working capital effects of around EUR 6 bn by 2025 and at least EUR 7 bn by 2030, a ROACE of at least 12% in the mid and long term, and continuation of its attractive shareholder distributions. These are supported by sound capital allocation priorities and a strong balance sheet, with a mid/long-term leverage ratio of below 30%.\n\nBuilding on its current strengths and a vision of leadership in technology and innovation, OMV will be well positioned to thrive sustainably in a world with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This strategy enhances OMV's shareholder value, as its transformation path allows for a sustainable growth business model, showing the Group's commitment to cutting GHG emissions and delivering strong financials and attractive shareholder distributions.\n\nThe Chemicals & Materials business will be the core growth engine of the Group.

In this context, the Group's target is to deliver around 2 mn t of sustainable Chemicals & Materials products by 2030. 80% of these volumes are planned to be produced in Europe, which represents around 40% of OMV's polyolefin production capacity in Europe.\n\nOMV also aims to become a leading innovative producer of sustainable fuels and chemical feedstocks. To achieve this, the Company will optimize the interface between oil and chemicals, with a focus on the integrated Schwechat and Burghausen sites, by redesigning plants to maximize high-value fossil resources, and with a growing share of sustainable fuels and feedstocks for chemicals production. This will significantly reduce diesel product output by 2030, while increasing the chemical yield to around 24%. The production of renewable fuels and sustainable feedstocks will increase to approximately 1.5 mn t, while crude oil distillation throughput will decrease by 2.6 mn t. Furthermore, OMV aims to become the first choice of our customers for energy, mobility, and convenience, focusing on the sale of sustainable aviation fuels, building an EV charging network and growing its non-fuel retail business.\n\nIn the Energy business, OMV is focusing on maximizing value and harvesting cash. OMV Energy will gradually reduce its fossil production to ~350 kboe/d by 2030, with a share of around 60% of natural gas. In the same period, OMV will make significant investments in lowcarbon solutions, namely in around 10 TWh of renewable energy (e.g., geothermal) and around 5 mn t p.a. of CCS capacity by 2030 to reduce its GHG footprint. The\n\nEnergy business will act as a cash engine for the Group and will support the transformation.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials (C&M)\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Grow in attractive markets with a particular focus on North America and Asia\n- \u25b8 Develop into a global leader in specialty polyolefin solutions\n- \u25b8 Grow sustainable chemical production capacity to up to 2 mn t\n- \u25b8 Diversify portfolio by entering adjacent products and new product groups\n- \u25b8 Establish a leading position in renewable and circular economy solutions\n\nDemand for chemical products will continue to grow ahead of global GDP, even in a low GHG emission world. Virgin polyolefin demand is expected to grow slightly above global GDP with a CAGR (2022-2030) of 4.1%. Most of this demand growth stems from highgrowth markets in Asia and is associated with a variety of different end-user markets and applications, providing a natural hedge against the volatility of individual industries. Recycled polyolefins are projected to grow with a CAGR (2022-2030) of 12%, significantly above GDP, thanks to strong end-market commitments especially in the consumer goods sector, increasing regulatory pressure, and the need for end-of-life solutions for plastic waste.\n\nPolyolefins play a critical role as eco-efficient enablers for a sustainable future, e.g., making lighter-weight automotive solutions and packaging that reduces food waste and increases shelf life possible. The current linear value chain in polyolefins faces significant challenges: mismanaged and unmanaged waste, environmental pollution, unnecessary emissions, and accumulation of microplastics. Transforming the value chain from a linear into a circular model will be one of the priorities for a sustainable chemicals business going forward. However, this requires a profound transformation to enable scale at attractive profitability. Current feedstock accessible directly from recycling is limited. For this reason, tapping into upstream and downstream feedstocks, primarily through partnerships, is critical to ensuring sufficient access to plastic waste. Partnerships with brand owners and retailers ensure attractive long-term offtake agreements with green product premiums. In addition, the future operating model needs to be set up to rapidly respond to changing customer and regulatory demands, with a primary focus on the advanced European landscape but also on the ability to quickly roll out successful blueprints globally.",

As a result, F&F will enable the transformation to low-carbon operations and sales while maintaining strong profitability.\n\nEuropean fossil refining market potential will decrease significantly up to 2030, as both volumes and refining margins are expected to be under pressure driven by the pace of the energy transition in Europe. In the same time horizon, strong growth will materialize for renewable mobility fuels, as well as sustainable chemical feedstocks. F&F will proactively decrease crude oil distillation throughput in the Schwechat and Burghausen refineries, from 12.9 mn t in 2019 to approximately 10.3 mn t in 2030, in line with changing demand patterns. This adaptation will significantly reduce heating oil and diesel product output by 2030, while increasing the chemical yield to around 24% for the Western refineries. To leverage the opportunities of the ongoing energy transition, the F&F division is developing a sustainable production portfolio for renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks, such as the co-processing of biogenic feedstocks in Schwechat, reaching approximately 1.5 mn t in total by 2030. In this context, the sourcing of bio-feedstocks will be a critical success factor. 80% of 2030 OMV's feedstock requirements already has a clear sourcing plan.\n\nOMV will optimize the interface between oil and chemicals, with a focus on the integrated Schwechat and Burghausen sites, by reconfiguring plants and sites to maximize high-value fossil resources, and with a growing share of sustainable feedstocks for chemicals production. OMV will continue to operate its three European refineries in Austria, Germany, and Romania as an integrated system, optimizing asset utilization and maximizing margins. Furthermore, the Company is implementing energy and operational efficiency measures within the existing refinery assets to maintain a leading cost position in Europe.\n\nOMV's goal with its international, non-operated refining positions in the UAE (ADNOC Refining) and Pakistan (PARCO) is to improve their commercial performance. The focus in the short to mid-term will be on operational excellence and performance culture at each asset. In the mid to long term, OMV will evaluate commercial options for the production of sustainable mobility fuels and chemical feedstocks.\n\nThe F&F activities in Europe secure OMV's customer and market access. In line with changing demand patterns, as well as regulatory obligations, OMV will gradually transform its product portfolio to include more sustainable fuels and services by 2030, thereby increasing\n\nthe resilience of its product mix. OMV will build a growing business for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in Central Europe by establishing new market positions in the vicinity of planned production sites. F&F will market at least 700,000 t of SAF by 2030. OMV will aim to grow SAF sales volumes significantly beyond the planned regulatory framework and will target the growing voluntary compliance market. Simultaneously, F&F will sustain its position of bitumen and marine fuel oil to safeguard refinery utilization, while continuing to evolve these products to lower GHG emissions.\n\nIn Retail Mobility & Convenience, OMV intends to further develop existing market potential by significantly growing the non-fuel business sector. New gastronomy and service concepts, as well as cooperation in the food logistics sector, are expected to significantly increase the volume and margin of the non-fuel business by 2030. In parallel, the Company will further increase its premium fuel share to more than 30% as a differentiator and significant margin generator by 2030. OMV Retail Mobility & Convenience will expand into e-mobility, building a leading position in out-of-home Electric Vehicle (EV) charging locations such as highway and transit refilling stations, as well as convenience hubs. With a total investment in this segment of more than EUR 400 mn by 2030, OMV will grow the profitability of the retail business as well as monetizing the value of its assets.\n\nTotal organic investments in the F&F business will average EUR 1 bn p.a. in 2022-2030, EUR 0.5 bn p.a. of which will be allocated to sustainable and carbon emissions reduction projects.\n\nWith this new strategy, OMV will accelerate the attainment of its goal of lowering GHG emissions by reducing fossil fuels, stepping up the production and marketing of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks, and implementing energy efficiency measures.\n\n## Energy\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Production is expected to decline to ~370 kboe/d by 2025 and ~350 kboe/d by 2030, excluding any potential divestments\n- \u25b8 Portfolio managed as a robust cash generator to support the Group's transformation\n- \u25b8 Low-carbon business solutions will be developed, with around 10 TWh in renewable energy (e.g., geothermal) and around 5 mn t p.a.

        "page_content": "In the context of the ongoing energy transition and to support the OMV Group's transformation, Energy will be managed as a robust cash generator and will focus on further upgrading its competitive asset portfolio, concentrating on the three core regions: Central and Eastern Europe, the North Sea, and Middle East and Africa. The shift of the hydrocarbon portfolio to gas will continue, with further divestments of non-core positions to improve efficiency, while the low-carbon business will be ramped up to achieve a material contribution by the end of the decade. On February 27, 2023, OMV announced that it started the sales process for the divestment of its E&P assets in the Asia-Pacific region: a 50% stake in SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd. and 100% of the shares in OMV New Zealand Limited.\n\nStarting with 2023, the Energy business incorporates the entire value chain of gas, as Gas & Power Eastern Europe, which includes Supply, Marketing and Trading of gas in Romania and Turkey and one gas-fired power plant in Romania, was transferred from Fuels & Feedstock to the Energy business segment.\n\nBoosting value delivery and cash generation are the main goals and criteria for managing and developing the portfolio of oil and gas assets, with a strong emphasis on gas. The delivery over the mid-term of key projects in the portfolio, such as the Neptun Development in Romania, and the Umm Lulu SARB Phase 2 plateau extension in the UAE, will support strong cash generation by and beyond 2025. OMV expects production levels of ~370 kboe/d by 2025 and ~350 kboe/d by 2030, with a share of around 60% of natural gas, excluding any potential divestments. In order to sustain the above-mentioned production levels, ramp up the lowcarbon business, and deliver strong cash generation, OMV Energy anticipates a total annual average CAPEX in 2022-2030 of around EUR 1.6 bn, EUR 0.6 bn of which are earmarked for low-carbon activities. OMV's exploration and appraisal activities are being streamlined further, and the total annual average budget is expected to be around EUR 0.2 bn over the decade. Toward the end of the decade, oil and gas CAPEX and E&A expenditure will be reduced, thereby allowing for more capital to be allocated to ramping up the low-carbon business and the broader OMV transformation.\n\nOMV Energy plans to reinforce the competitiveness of its portfolio and resilience through a strong focus on operational excellence, fostered by digitalization and agile ways of working, as well as portfolio optimization.\n\nTo supply its gas customers, OMV will continue to complement its own natural gas production in Norway, Austria, and Romania with third-party supply sources on\n\nwhich the Group is working to diversify. The equity gas contribution to the gas sales business will decrease significantly toward the end of the decade in the Northwestern European region due to natural fields decline, and, as needed, will largely be replaced with green gases, such as biogas and hydrogen, primarily obtained from the markets, to reduce the carbon intensity of its product portfolio. New equity gas volumes from the Romanian Neptun project will keep volumes high in Southeastern Europe. OMV will also aim to direct an increasing share of its natural gas sales to customers from non-energy sectors, to further reduce its Scope 3 portfolio emissions.\n\nThe Group will explore a range of opportunities and portfolio choices that enhance cash flow generated by the current Energy business and support a potential accelerated transition to sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. These opportunities may include capturing the full value potential of the asset base, e.g., low-carbon business potential, maintaining reservoir production excellence, and optimizing costs as well as assessing and developing joint venture opportunities for selected assets without excluding inorganic options.\n\nTo reduce its operational carbon footprint, OMV Energy will pursue the phase-out of routine gas flaring and venting, reduce fugitive methane emissions, and introduce portfolio optimization measures. In addition, renewable energy projects will also be pursued for the purpose of powering OMV's own operations, such as the photovoltaic plant developed with VERBUND in Sch\u00f6nkirchen (Austria). To achieve an overall reduction of both absolute and relative GHG emissions from its product portfolio, OMV Energy will leverage its existing asset base and core skills to deliver financially strong low-carbon business projects. Available opportunities will be captured to build up geothermal energy capacity that generates up to 9 TWh p.a. by 2030. In addition to geothermal, around 1 TWh from renewable power will be developed in OMV core regions with favorable sun and wind conditions to serve primarily captive demand, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions by OMV's own operations. The Energy business will further tap its existing reservoirs and (sub-)surface capabilities to implement opportunities that lead to a CCS capacity of approximately 5 mn t p.a. of CO2 net to OMV by 2030. In addition, further opportunities where OMV Energy can leverage its strengths and capabilities are being explored, e.g., hydrogen and energy storage, and will potentially be pursued in consideration of OMV strategic priorities.",

OMV targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net-zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scopes 1 and 2, OMV aims for an absolute reduction of 30% by 2030 and of 60% by 2040. For the defined categories in Scope 3, OMV aims for an absolute reduction of 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040. In terms of reducing the carbon intensity of energy supply, OMV intends to achieve a decrease of 20% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.\n\nOMV has also voluntarily committed to apply the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) framework. As a result, OMV committed to:\n\n- \u25b8 E&P methane emissions accounting shall be in line as a minimum with the OGMP 2.0 framework\n- \u25b8 Reduce methane intensity to 0.2% by 2025 and to 0.1% by 2030.\n- \u25b8 Operated E&P asset must have a source-level measurement of methane emissions (OGMP 2.0 level 4) in three years at the latest\n\nOMV awaits the publication of the science-based targets (SBT) methodology for the oil & gas sector to evaluate its targets against the SBT requirements and get them approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\nThese emission reductions can only be achieved with\n\nconsiderable effort and capital allocated: the Group has earmarked organic investments of more than EUR 13 bn for this purpose in 2022-2030, which represent around 40% of total organic CAPEX. All business units will build on their existing strengths and know-how\n\non this transformation journey. Three key initiatives will be undertaken to achieve the targeted reductions by 2030:\n\n- \u25b8 Decrease in fossil fuel sales: significant decrease in fossil fuels and a less steep decline in natural gas sales\n- \u25b8 Increase in Chemicals & Materials recycling and sustainable feedstocks, and delivery of approximately 2 mn t p.a. of circular products: recyclate production substituting fossil chemicals and materials production and production from biogenic feedstock\n- \u25b8 Increase in zero-carbon energy sales: significant increase in sustainable and biobased fuels, green gas sales, and build-up of photovoltaic electricity capacity primarily for captive use as well as geothermal energy\n\nBesides these efforts, neutralization measures will be necessary. OMV anticipates that it will use around 5 mn t of CCS capacity across all business units. All energy purchases will be 100% renewable.

The value-driven finance strategy operates according to a clear framework for enabling long-term profitable and resilient growth, and aims to achieve a ROACE of at least 12%, positive free cash flow after dividends, a strong balance sheet, with a mid/long-term leverage ratio of below 30%, a clean CCS Operating Result of at least EUR 5 bn by 2025 and EUR 6 bn by 2030, increasing clean CCS net income attributable to shareholders, operating cash flow excluding net working capital of around EUR 6 bn by 2025 and at least EUR 7 bn by 2030, as well as attractive shareholder distributions. When building its financial plan, OMV defined a sound capital allocation policy: first, investing in its organic portfolio; second, paying attractive dividends; third, pursuing inorganic spending for an accelerated transformation; fourth, deleveraging; and fifth, special dividends. In its capital allocation, the Group focuses on selecting the most competitive and resilient projects. The defined investment criteria include hurdle rates and payback periods by business reflecting respective risk and return profiles, as well as testing projects for their resilience and break-even versus relevant market KPIs.\n\nTo achieve its strategic goal, OMV plans a yearly organic CAPEX of around EUR 3.5 bn for the period 2022-2030. Overall, the Group is allocating more than EUR 13 bn in this period to achieve its ambitious decarbonization targets, which represents around 40% of total organic CAPEX. In addition, OMV will consider inorganic growth in areas of strategic importance. However, this will depend on the Group's indebtedness headroom. Moreover, the Group's portfolio of assets can provide options through divestments to accelerate strategy execution when attractive acquisition targets in targeted growth areas become available.\n\nThe Group's strategy, supported by disciplined capital allocation, will enable OMV to generate increasing and resilient cash flows and higher earnings. These solid financials ensure a strong balance sheet for the Group. In its financial framework, OMV has made a significant commitment to ensuring a robust balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. The Company aims to achieve a leverage ratio of below 30% for the mid- and long-term. Depending on portfolio measures, the leverage ratio can exceed 30%; however, this will then be followed by a deleveraging program to ensure the balance sheet is strengthened.\n\nOMV seeks to align its long-term funding policy with the Company's sustainability strategy. Therefore, OMV is assessing the opportunity of sustainability-linked funding, which links the cost of a financing instrument to the achievement of specific strategic sustainability targets, such as GHG emission reduction goals or sustainable polyolefin production targets.\n\nDuring the strategy period, OMV is committed to delivering attractive shareholder distributions. The Group has amended its shareholder distribution policy in December 2022 and added special dividends as a new, additional instrument to the existing progressive dividend policy. The progressive regular dividend policy is maintained and unaffected by this amendment. When OMV's leverage ratio is below 30%, OMV aims to distribute approximately 20% to 30% of the OMV Group's operating cash flow (including net working capital effects) per year to its shareholders through its regular dividend, as a priority, and additionally, if sufficient funds are available, through the new instrument of a special dividend. In case of a leverage ratio of 30% or higher, OMV's progressive regular dividend will be maintained, but no special dividend shall be paid. The dividend payments in any given year are subject to specific dividend proposals by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "## Climate Change\n\nOMV recognizes climate change as one of the most important global challenges and fully supports the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement. OMV integrates risks and opportunities related to climate change impacts into the development of the Company's business strategy and the planning of operational activities. In this regard, OMV continuously improves the carbon efficiency of its operations and product portfolio and is fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition. We aim to become a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner.\n\nOMV implements measures aimed at optimizing its operational processes, increasing energy efficiency, reducing flaring and venting, reducing methane emissions through leakage detection and repair, and improving asset integrity. We will continue phasing out routine flaring and venting as soon as possible, but no later than 2030, as part of OMV's commitment to the World Bank's 'Zero routine flaring by 2030' initiative. For example, in late 2022, a new gas treatment station for Low Temperature Separation (LTS) at a Romanian E&P asset was brought on stream. As a result, gas that would normally be flared is captured and made available for sale. Consequently, through the aforementioned approach for example, GHG emissions are estimated to be reduced by 24,000 t CO2e from 2023 onward due to the elimination of routine flaring.\n\nWe are also increasingly turning to renewable sources of electricity to power our operations. In Austria, following the realization of Phase II of the OMV and VERBUND photovoltaic park at Sch\u00f6nkirchen, 12.9 GWh of renewable electricity was produced. It is estimated that throughout the year 15.84 GWh of renewable energy will be produced. In Romania, OMV Petrom completed the installation of PV panels at its first solar park. The park includes nearly 1,000 PV panels installed over an area of 5,500 m 2 . The green energy produced will be used to supply electricity for ongoing operations in the E&P segment. Also by the end of Q4/22, PV panels were installed at 380 OMV and OMV Petrom-branded filling stations. The electricity produced from these installations annually is estimated at 7,000 MWh. In parallel, several Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy providers were signed by OMV Group in 2022. For instance, in October 2022, Borealis and Axpo Nordic, a subsidiary of Switzerland's largest renewable energy provider, signed a wind PPA, which includes the annual supply of more than 130 GWh of wind power to the Borealis production location in Stenungsund (Sweden) over the next ten years. The elec-\n\nricity will be generated by a new onshore wind farm located in central Sweden, with delivery expected to start in January 2024.\n\nA cornerstone of our climate strategy is increasing the share of zero-carbon products in our product portfolio, as well as decreasing fossil fuel production and sales. Oil and gas production will be decreased to around 350 kboe/d by 2030. Growth will instead come from zero-carbon products, such as geothermal energy, hydrogen, and Sustainable Aviation Fuels. In our E&P segment, we will build up around 10 TWh of renewable energy production (including geothermal, PV, and wind). In 2022, OMV made headway in the development of two geothermal projects: one in Austria, the other in Germany. In Austria, OMV conducted a production and injection test to analyze the geothermal potential in the Vienna Basin. Regional and local geological studies have been progressing, and potential locations for geothermal power plants have also been selected. In Lower Saxony (Germany) OMV and partner ZeroGeo Energy GmbH have an equal interest of 50% each in a geothermal exploration project called Thermo. The initial project aim is to collect geological data, in particular gravity and magnetic measurements, over an area of approximately 5,000 km 2 . The data collected will be used to assess the geothermal energy potential and will be part of a comprehensive evaluation of future geothermal activities in the area. Based on preliminary studies, subsurface experts indicate that the geothermal conditions in the Vienna Basin are suitable for use as a direct heat carrier. In northern Germany, the geothermal energy could be used to generate electricity.\n\nWe aim to step up the production of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks to approximately 1.5 mn t per year, including marketing at least 700,000 t of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) per year. In 2022, three Memorandums of Understanding for the intended offtake of SAF were signed with Lufthansa Group, Ryanair, and WizzAir. The total amount of intended SAF offtake between 2023 and 2030 is more than 800,000 t for the Lufthansa Group, up to 160,000 t for Ryanair, and up to 185,000 t for WizzAir.\n\nOur climate targets can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. The OMV Group has earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn by 2030 for this purpose, representing around 40% of organic CAPEX over that period. All business units will build on existing strengths and expertise to contribute to this transformation.",

        "page_content": "## Business principles and social responsibility performance\n\n## Business ethics and compliance\n\nOMV is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and has a Code of Business Ethics in place that applies to all employees. Although we are headquartered in Austria - a country with high business ethics standards - we operate in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Americas, and Europe that are defined as high risk by the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. We strive to avoid the risks of bribery and corruption that are specific to our sector. We also highly value our reputation. Therefore, our highest priority is ensuring uniform compliance with our business ethics standards wherever we operate. Compliance with ethical standards is a non-negotiable value that supersedes any business interest. Absolute commitment to this objective is embedded at all levels of OMV from top management to every employee. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. Every Company activity, from planning business strategy to daily operations, is assessed for compliance with ethical standards, such as the Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics.\n\nA dedicated cross-regional compliance organization ensures that OMV standards are consistently met across the Group. In 2022, 7,537 OMV Group employees were trained in business ethics. The Integrity Platform provides an anonymous whistleblower mechanism for OMV employees and external stakeholders, such as suppliers. They can use this platform to report issues relating to corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, antitrust law, capital market law, public procurement, environmental protection, product and food safety and consumer protection, corporate tax regulations, and data protection.\n\n## Supplier Compliance\n\nImplementing sustainable procurement means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the goods and services the Company intends to purchase. OMV has a Code of Conduct in place that ensures that suppliers support OMV's principles. It is of paramount importance to our organization to be fully compliant with all applicable legal requirements, as well as with our internal safety, environmental protection, and human rights standards while managing our supply chain. OMV has a process in place to ensure that existing and potential business partners sanctioned by the EU or international organizations, such as the United Nations, are not accepted as procurement partners.\n\nTo mitigate supply chain risks including forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and corruption, OMV imposes the legal requirements and internal rules and standards applicable to OMV on its suppliers. Our suppliers and supply chain partners are obligated to sign and fully comply with the content of the Code of Conduct. In addition, our suppliers must accept the General Conditions of Purchase, which further detail our business standards (e.g., labor rights), as an integral part of our contractual agreements. OMV reserves the right to terminate relationships with suppliers if non-compliance is discovered or not addressed in a timely manner.\n\nSupplier prequalification is a part of precontractual activities, during which OMV collects information from a potential supplier for the purpose of evaluating compliance with our HSSE and other sustainability requirements. The goal of the prequalification process is to screen potential suppliers before bringing them on board or during the tender stage to ensure that only those suppliers who meet our HSSE and sustainability standards can be considered for future collaboration. Following prequalification, the procurement colleagues and business representatives select the best suppliers based on a predefined set of commercial and technical criteria during a tender process. In 2022, we continued to embed sustainability elements into sourcing activities (e.g., technologically innovative elements, carbon emissions, energy efficiency KPIs, CDP and EcoVadis score) during several pilot projects.\n\nOMV conducts supplier audits as part of the prequalification process and/or during contract execution. The aim of the audits is to measure the performance of our suppliers and define actions that will enable them to optimize their performance and meet OMV requirements. During the audits, we pay special attention to the financial stability of our suppliers, their strategy and organization, supply chain, sustainability (e.g., human rights, carbon footprint management, environmental management, certifications, and social responsibility), and their cybersecurity performance. We also carry out yearly subject-specific audits on topics such as process safety, quality, and efficiency. During the supplier audits, we place great emphasis on understanding not only the management approach to the topics within the scope of the audits (e.g., HSSE aspects), but also how the topics are understood and applied by the employees on site (e.g., through discussions with workers and managers).\n\nSince 2021, OMV has been a member of Together for Sustainability (TfS). As a joint initiative and global network of 40 companies, TfS sets the de facto global standard for the environmental, social, and governance",

Being a TfS member helps OMV to further embed sustainability into its dayto-day business operations and further cascade sustainability requirements within our supply chain.\n\nWe aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon volume of our purchased goods and services. Only by working together with our suppliers will we be able to define joint low-carbon initiatives to continuously decrease the carbon emissions in the supply chain and meet our Paris Agreement commitments. As part of its CDP Supply Chain membership, in 2022 OMV invited 231 suppliers to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire. Suppliers were selected based on spend, estimated carbon emissions volume, and the carbon intensity of the goods and services purchased from them. In addition to reporting their emissions, we asked the suppliers whether they have carbon reduction targets in place, and invited them to share with us any initiatives or projects to reduce carbon emissions in which they would like us to participate. 75% of responding suppliers have a climate target in place (vs. 63% in 2021).\n\n## Human Rights\n\nHuman rights are universal values that guide our conduct in every aspect of our activities. Our responsibilities in the area of human rights include, but are not limited to, equality and non-discrimination, decent wages, working hours, employee representation, security, primary health care, labor rights in the supply chain, education, poverty reduction, land rights, and free, prior, and informed consent. OMV respects and supports human rights as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in internationally recognized treaties, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO). We have been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2003 and are fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We fully support the aims of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are committed to operating our business and supply chain free of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. OMV considers human rights to be an important aspect of our risk management approach, which is integrated into our decision-making processes. OMV recognizes its responsibility to respect, fulfill, and support human rights in all business activities and to ensure that OMV does not become complicit in any human rights abuses as defined under current international law.\n\nWe conduct human rights risk assessments at country level to identify and assess ongoing and emerging human rights impacts and the resulting potential risks relevant to OMV business activities in the country in order to prevent and mitigate human rights risks and impacts. A total of 4,254 employees received training on human rights topics through the e-learning tool and in-person training sessions (2021: 980). As professional training is essential to ensure compliance with our human rights commitment, we have set ourselves the goal of training all employees in human rights topics by 2025. In addition, internal awareness campaigns on human rights were implemented. In 2022, 35 incidents of human rights grievances were reported (2021: 7).\n\nIn late July 2022, OMV's subsidiary Borealis was confronted with reports of alleged human trafficking practices conducted by the main contractor (IREM) and their sub-contractor on a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant construction site in Kallo, Belgium. The practices were reported to involve exploitation, inadequate compensation, lack of social security, and poor housing conditions. Borealis immediately suspended and later terminated all contracts with IREM due to its non-compliance with their fundamental principles, and retendered the contracts. After careful consideration, Borealis granted the majority of the works to the contractor Ponticelli and implemented thorough social controls at the Kallo construction site to respect and value the workers there. Work on the construction site gradually increased from October 2022.\n\nThe OMV Group always seeks to improve, and is strongly committed to further strengthening its processes and mitigation measures to prevent any maltreatment and disrespect of workers' human rights in the supply chain. At corporate level, we analyzed the HSSE and Procurement directives for contractor management and prepared a detailed checklist for human rights compliance to be used at site level. The revised human rights e-learning refers specifically to human rights in business relations, and the new OMV Group Human Rights Policy Statement details our human rights commitment related to labor rights and business partners in line with business best practice and international standards. Additionally, individual monitoring initiatives were implemented at local level throughout the Group to ensure our suppliers' compliance with human rights.\n\n## Community Relations and Development\n\nOMV maintains an active partnership with local communities in all countries in which the Company does business and is committed to adding value to these societies.

The integrity of OMV's operating facilities, loss prevention, proactive risk management, and climate change mitigation are essential for attaining OMV's HSSE vision of 'ZERO harm - NO losses.'\n\n## HSSE Strategy\n\nTo achieve this vision, the OMV Group's HSSE Strategy was established as an integral part of the OMV Sustainability Strategy. The HSSE Strategy focuses on the cross-functional goals of strong HSSE commitment and leadership, increased efficiency and effectiveness of HSSE processes, management of HSSE risks, and skilled people, as well as subject matter goals in the areas of:\n\n- \u25b8 Health: improving the ability to work through integrated health management\n- \u25b8 Security: protecting people, assets, and reputation from emerging malicious intentional threats\n- \u25b8 Safety: establishing sustainable safety for people and facilities\n- \u25b8 Environment: minimizing the environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of activities\n\n## Health, safety, and security\n\nIn 2022, the combined Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR) for OMV employees and contractors was 0.78 (2021: 0.57), and our combined Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) was 1.23 (2021: 0.96). We are deeply concerned about the work-related fatality of a contractor who fell off a roof while carrying out repairs in France. Managing the COVID-19 pandemic remained a high priority in 2022 alongside routine HSSE management. Our main focus was to learn from incidents across the Company: videos, alerts, and communication campaigns were again used to reach out to all employees.\n\nThe business segment Chemicals & Materials reached a TRIR of 2.85 (2021: 2.25). There was a strong focus on implementing occupational safety improvement initiatives, holding dedicated HSSE training sessions, as well as the further strengthening of the safety culture and risk awareness. Special attention was paid to contractor HSSE management and learning from past incidents, to prevent recurrences and embed appropriate improvement measures.\n\nThe HSSE performance of Refining & Marketing in 2022 resulted in a TRIR of 0.82 (2021: 0.54). Great effort was put into broad safety and security awareness and prevention campaigns in order to establish a strong and positive safety culture. This was especially the case during the planned maintenance turnarounds that took place in the Schwechat and Burghausen refineries. During the past year, special emphasis was placed on findings from incidents, leadership engagement, contractor management, and training on various emergency and crisis management scenarios. The consistent implementation of the process safety road maps and improvement initiatives was another area of focus.\n\nExploration & Production had a TRIR of 1.09 (2021: 0.92). The numbers show that a constant effort is required to minimize the occurrence of incidents. In addition, we encountered 18 High Potential Incidents (HiPos) that could have resulted in serious or fatal injuries under slightly different circumstances. All these incidents were subjected to thorough incident investigations and measures were taken to prevent recurrence. Contractor management continues to be a focus area in our HSSE efforts. Our activities concerning process safety management, and various other initiatives aimed at ensuring the safety and integrity of our facilities, continued in 2022.\n\n## OMV Group safety performance\n\nIn mn hours worked\n\n|                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Company                         |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 1.11   | 0.70   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 1.32   | 1.18   |\n| Contractors                     |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 0.62   | 0.51   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 1.19   | 0.85   |\n| Total (Company and contractors) |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 0.78   | 0.57   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 1.23   | 0.96   |",

The year 2022 was still strongly influenced by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Our medical teams and service providers were challenged with supporting the emergency management teams in updating and implementing pandemic preparedness plans, guidelines and health information, and providing support to employees suffering from COVID-19 at home and in hospital. In addition, OMV continued its long tradition of offering health and prevention programs, such as cardiovascular disease prevention programs, thyroid screenings and other voluntary health checks, vaccinations (especially against flu and in some countries COVID-19), and virtual health hours, such as ideas for a healthy worklife balance or first aid measures that go far beyond legal requirements.\n\nIn 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic again posed major challenges for safety management. At the operational level, we took preventive and business continuity-related measures, such as strictly segregated teams in key areas, hygiene measures, and ongoing awarenessraising. Despite restricted travel and thanks to digital communication and collaboration tools, we were able to carry out the following important safety-related activities:\n\n- \u25b8 We have updated our Life-Saving Rules and harmonized them across the OMV Group. This simple set of rules helps prevent fatal and severe accidents, and applies to all employees and contractors. Training and communication materials have been produced in 18 languages for an intensive refresher campaign in 2023.\n- \u25b8 As part of our safety culture program, we held several workshops on 'making HSSE personal' at different levels of the Company. The semi-annual meetings with the program owner were conducted online.\n- \u25b8 All incidents at level 3 and higher and HiPos were investigated, and lessons learned were communicated throughout the organization. Improvement initiatives were developed and closely monitored using our HSSE reporting tool.\n- \u25b8 Contractor HSSE management is key to the OMV Group's safety performance. We introduced a new e-learning program, held webinars, and delivered over 900 trainings to more than 660 beneficiaries and procurement staff on the internal regulations framework. We also held strategic supplier meetings with prime contractors to share information, experiences, and expectations.\n- \u25b8 Global HSSE training for employees and managers was completely revised and updated. An e-learning\n- course consisting of 13 modules was developed for basic HSSE training.\n- \u25b8 We supported and followed up on the implementation of process safety road maps across OMV's ventures, assets, and refineries. In our Integrated Risk Register, we continued to analyze and prioritize process safety risks to ensure that investments effectively lead to a significant reduction in risks.\n- \u25b8 We developed a harmonized set of KPIs and a process safety dashboard. Furthermore, a Group Process Safety Committee has been established, including Members of the Executive Board, which meets periodically to discuss process safety performance, achievements, and challenges.\n- \u25b8 The OMV Group Process Safety Network, a large online collaboration platform, met quarterly to exchange information and experiences in virtual meetings (> 200 participants). Senior management also participated.\n- \u25b8 An important milestone has been achieved with the successful go-live of the OMV Group HSSE reporting tool. This is a key step in our ongoing harmonization and enables us to report in one single system across the OMV Group and Borealis by replacing all existing tools.\n- \u25b8 We completed the review of 15 group-wide HSSE regulations and achieved systematic alignment between the OMV Group and Borealis.\n\nAn unstable geopolitical environment combined with complex new and enduring regional conflicts remained a constant security focus throughout 2022. The Corporate Security department continued to monitor these geopolitical situations, accelerating OMV's understanding of strategic events to identify any emerging threats that might interfere with business planning. This included cases of armed conflict, civil unrest, and criminality at local, national, regional, and international levels.\n\nWe updated our proven security management system in 2022, enabling us to anticipate or respond to a broad spectrum of geopolitical, regional, or isolated security incidents. The security risk assessment platform continued to provide real-time oversight of asset risk exposure levels as influenced by geopolitical or security events. Despite various geopolitical and pandemic-related challenges, the Corporate Security department continued to deliver global operational support, governance, and oversight, and will maintain a comparable and effective security strategy to allow OMV to operate despite converging asymmetric threats.\n\nIn 2021, OMV's Executive Board took the decision that OMV would join the Voluntary Principles on Security",

As a result of this analysis, we are now in the process of adopting their recommendations with a view to joining the VPSHR in 2023.\n\n## Environmental management\n\nDue to the nature of its operations, OMV has an impact on the environment. The Group strives to minimize this impact at all times, particularly with respect to spills, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water and waste management. OMV strives to optimize processes to use natural resources as efficiently as possible and reduce emissions and discharges.\n\nIn 2022, there were 2 major hydrocarbon spills (level 3 of five; 2021: 3 spills). The total volume of hydrocarbon spilled was higher compared to the previous year. OMV continues to work on its oil spill response preparedness and capabilities.\n\nKey environmental measures and achievements in 2022:\n\n- \u25b8 Water management plans have been established at our main operational sites to reduce water-related risks and ensure efficient and sustainable water use.\n- \u25b8 At our FCC unit, the installation of an additional electrostatic precipitator module reduced dust emissions by up to 70%.\n- \u25b8 At the Schwechat refinery, we succeeded in significantly reducing water consumption and emissions to air. More than 5% of the average annual water consumption has been saved, most of it through a new control concept for cooling water in a heat exchanger group in the ethylene plant.\n- \u25b8 At the Petrobrazi refinery, the tank modernization program continued in 2022 with the modernization of one volatile product tank and the commissioning of a new tank, according to best available technology, which will contribute to the reduction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.\n\n- \u25b8 In 2022, OMV Petrom completed the surface abandonment of 746 wells and 40 facilities in the E&P division. A total of 157,000 t of contaminated soil was treated in our bioremediation plants, and 13,180 t of metal scrap was recycled by authorized companies.\n- \u25b8 Borealis is further commited to restore and maintain a healthy and productive ocean based on the UN Sustainable Ocean Principles and the UN Global Compact membership. Furthermore, Borealis continued its STOP project, a pioneering program to support cities in developing and emerging countries in establishing cost-efficient, effective, and circular waste collection systems. For more information, visit the STOP project website at www.stopoceanplastics.com.\n- \u25b8 An enhanced monitoring tool for spill prevention has been implemented at OMV Petrom. The industry-recognized digital well integrity tool was established to assess risks to the integrity of individual wells, prioritize inspections, and take appropriate mitigation actions. By the end of 2022, we had successfully completed the digitization of 4,000 wells, which represents more than 50% of the total.\n- \u25b8 To honor the commitment to achieving zero pellet losses in operations and the supply chain, Borealis has incorporated all elements of Operation Clean Sweep \u00ae (OCS), an international pellet loss reduction program. In addition, Borealis has proactively contributed to the development of a third-party audit and certification scheme for OCS led by the industry interest group Plastics Europe. Borealis' target is to achieve full third-party OCS certification at all of its sites in Europe by 2024.\n- \u25b8 Planting continues at the Pohokura natural gas production station in New Zealand. As part of a threeyear planting plan to regenerate native species,  500 specimens were planted in 2022.\n- \u25b8 We have continued to work on improving our impact on nature. To achieve this, we apply the mitigation hierarchy in our projects with the following steps: Avoidance, Minimization, Restoration, Offset and Compensation. We want to make a positive impact on nature by implementing biodiversity initiatives, such as our green areas project in arid parts of Tunisia. We continued our tree planting initiatives in 2022 at our Waha and Nawara sites, which include an irrigation system. The goal is to create recreational areas to improve the well-being of employees and visitors.",

        "page_content": "## Employees\n\nWe know that it is the combined 22,300 employees of OMV who turn the Group's strategy into results and success. We are proud of what we have achieved together. Trust and pride in the organization fuel our employees' energy and determination to tackle challenges and to focus on innovative solutions to make us even stronger.\n\n## OMV's People & Culture Strategy\n\nIn 2022, we developed a Group-wide People & Culture Strategy, which fully supports the transformation of OMV. The core of the new People & Culture Strategy is our purpose, i.e., 'Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living'. We have developed four strategic drivers, plus one additional pillar, Transformational Leadership:\n\n- \u25b8 Employee Experience\n- \u25b8 Organizational Evolution\n- \u25b8 Growing Talent\n- \u25b8 New Ways of Working\n\n## Highlights of 2022\n\nFollowing the announcement of the OMV Group's Strategy 2030, all Human Resources (HR) functions Groupwide were renamed People & Culture (P&C). The aim of this department is to fully support the OMV Group's Strategy 2030 by prioritizing key aspects that enable us to unlock our organization's full potential. The new name points to the department's aim and purpose, and emphasizes that people and culture are central to achieving the targets defined in our strategy. As such, the statement 'People make it happen' not only creates the right working environment in which our employees can thrive, but also ensures that they can further develop their skill sets to meet the demands of our dynamic business.\n\nIn March 2022, our Group-wide purpose, 'Re-inventing essentials for sustainable living', was launched. To bring this purpose to life, a change agent and volunteering network has been set up. We also introduced Purpose Learning Weeks, focusing on the three purpose enablers, namely Advancing Circular, Working Together, and Stimulating Transformation. With the Purpose Learning Weeks, we want to create deeper insight into each of our purpose enablers. The first Purpose Learning Week on Advancing Circular took place in June 2022 and addressed various topics relating to the circular economy.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to affect our employees in 2022, many implemented employment-related measures were continued to protect the health, well-being, and economic situation of our employees. In 2022, we worked specifically on our work-from-home concepts to give employees more flexibility. Working from home is now offered to a broader group of staff and the number of work-from-home days per month has significantly increased.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced an employee engagement strategy whereby we check in with our employees on how they are doing and how they are dealing with the pandemic situation. In September 2022, a Group-wide Pulse Check was performed throughout the OMV Group. The Pulse Check is one of our most important tools for measuring the engagement of our employees. It is an essential part of our new People & Culture Strategy relating to Employee Experience. We achieved a very high response rate of 70% on a Group level, and conclusions and subsequent actions will be agreed.\n\nIn 2022, there was a focus on mandatory, legally binding, and business-critical independent learning (e.g., e-learning, online learning through our partnership with LinkedIn Learning, and virtual courses/webinars). Due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19, we again concentrated on virtual training delivery, as in 2021. All measures to support employees in the virtual and hybrid environment were therefore continued. This included the delivery of virtual health webinars, virtual training of facilitators, and an updated personal skills SharePoint, among other things.\n\nLeadership training focused on first-time leaders, women in leadership, and how to manage remote and hybrid teams. For identified talents at executive level, a dedicated talent program focusing on enhancing executive leadership skills was implemented. New ways of working also continued to be a focus point, for example through the integration of agile ways of working and the newly introduced Project Management Certification Program. In terms of graduate development, we expanded our portfolio offering to include a tailored graduate program in Refining as well as continuing with our long-standing Integrated Graduate Development (IGD) Program in E&P.",

These new values have been co-created together with our employees to help shape the future of the OMV Group and how we all work together. The new values will then be launched in 2023 alongside a campaign. Moreover, we are also developing leadership competencies closely linked to the newly defined values, to help in identifying and developing future and present leaders.\n\nTo achieve the OMV Group's Strategy 2030, we will roll out dedicated global initiatives on Purpose and Values and a new transformational leadership program in 2023. We will also set up a Sustainability Academy that offers an ever-growing selection of varied, pre-selected learning material to support our employees in expanding their knowledge and enhancing their mindset when it comes to OMV's journey to net zero. Additionally, we plan to offer specific training initiatives to support the upskilling of technical employees, for example training on low-carbon energy, geothermal energy, decision quality, and data science.\n\n## Diversity\n\nAn employee survey on diversity, equal opportunities,\n\nand inclusion was launched at the end of 2021. Through this, the OMV Group was able to further strengthen the culture of listening to unheard voices in our Company, and collect feedback from employees on diversity, equal opportunities, and an inclusive environment in the Company. The survey's findings played an important part in developing OMV's new Group-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy 2030, which was launched in 2022.\n\nOur focus on diversity is also being actively nurtured throughout the organization today, supported by a range of training sessions, activities, and awareness campaigns. We also continued our series of online events with external guest speakers on relevant diversity topics. International Women's Day is a day to focus on equality and women's rights worldwide. In 2022, the motto #BreakTheBias directed the focus toward prejudices that still stand in the way of women's equality. OMV fully supports this approach and therefore organized events in March 2022, including a presentation of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) quick poll insights and a discussion on the topic. The DEI Awareness Month took place in October 2022, with various events focusing on the topics of interest as determined by the DEI survey conducted in 2021 (gender, generations, parenting, disabilities, and unconscious bias).\n\nOMV is committed to ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees and has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind. In line with our commitment to equality and non-discrimination, we began working on a formal non-discrimination policy in 2022. This will be introduced in 2023.\n\nWe have designed and implemented targeted training programs, such as SHEnergy, a blended learning program for women at OMV, to support women's leadership skills. The program focuses on active inclusion skills and also emphasizes the power of mentoring and networking in developing female leaders.\n\nAs a result of these measures, the percentage of women in the Group is about 27% (2021: 27%). A total of 21.6% (2021: 20.9%) of employees in advanced and executive positions are female.",

        "page_content": "## OMV Group Business Year\n\nIn 2022, OMV has achieved a strong clean CCS Operating Result of EUR 11.2 bn. Furthermore, cash flow from operating activities excluding net working capital effects remained significant amounting to EUR 9.8 bn, and the organic free cash flow before dividends totaled EUR 4.9 bn. As a consequence, the leverage ratio decreased from 21% at the end of 2021 to 8% at the end of 2022. This financial strength is an excellent basis for OMV's further strategic development into a leader in sustainable fuels, chemicals and materials while committing to deliver attractive shareholder returns.\n\n## Business environment\n\nGlobal economic growth during 2022 is estimated to have been the weakest for two decades, save only for the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis (2009) and the depths of the COVID-19-related slowdown (2020). A broad set of headwinds confronted the global economy in 2022, with annual growth expected at some 3.2%, according to the IMF. This represents a significant drop from the 6% registered in 2021. According to UNCTAD, global trade, meanwhile, is expected to have reached an outright record in 2022 1 , with growth more concentrated in services. However, the second half of 2022 saw something of a slowdown, with global goods trade turning negative in the third quarter, before services trade followed in the fourth quarter.\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact markets in early 2022, even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine tipped supply and demand further out of balance from the second half of Q1 onward. Outsized spending on goods relative to services - combined with ongoing bottlenecks in supply chains - drove rapid, marked increases in inflation in almost all large economies. Headline CPI topped 8% on average over Q2 in the US, peaking in June at 9.1%. Headline inflation in the Eurozone averaged in double digits at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022, with a peak of 10.6% in October. Combating price increases for consumers and businesses became the main focus of central banks in 2022, while governments were tasked with mitigating the effects of price rises. This was especially true in Europe, where year-on-year price growth in energy was the single largest contributing factor to headline inflation. This became arguably the dominant political and economic issue for the region in 2022.\n\nThe economic headwinds piled up in various metrics as 2022 progressed. Purchasing Managers' Indices sank from mostly expansionary at the end of 2021 to mostly being in contraction territory by the middle of 2022, with only a couple of exceptions. Eurozone net exports flipped negative by Q3 (Eurostat), while essentially all other economic indicators spent the second half of the\n\nyear trending lower, i.e., toward recession territory. By the end of the year, financial conditions, consumer confidence, and services PMIs had made their way below the 20th percentile in data going back more than 20 years. The only metric to buck this trend has been the labor market, which, as of late 2022, remains historically tight, with unemployment numbers continuing to trend close to record lows.\n\nThis conundrum was still in place for central banks at the end of 2022 on both sides of the Atlantic. The macro environment focus has shifted definitively to the effects of more expensive financing and the potential for this to contribute to recessionary effects in advanced economies. The latest available GDP figures for the Eurozone indicate a significant decline in the third quarter of 2022. By the end of the year, the European Central Bank had raised its key deposit rate by 250 basis points, a rapid increase necessitated by surging inflation. Higher interest rates are having and will continue to have a lagged effect on consumer and business spending.\n\nThe fallout from the geopolitical upheaval following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been wide-ranging. However, supply and trade disruptions were arguably more pronounced in energy than anywhere else. And within energy, no region saw more pronounced price effects than Europe. Following the invasion, the decision by many western corporations to 'self-sanction' ahead of government mandates to limit or cease the trade and import of Russian energy was a key driver of the oil price rally that peaked at the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\nHowever, it was the natural gas market that was the epicenter of the energy-related difficulties experienced by Europe in 2022. The removal of the vast majority of Russian gas pipeline flows from the middle of the year posed an unprecedented challenge for the European Union, which, in 2021, sourced almost 40% of its natural gas imports from Russia and which was 20% dependent on natural gas for power generation. The removal of the region's single largest supply source from the market, combined with the government mandates",

        "page_content": "for minimum storage levels ahead of the onset of the heating season and reduced liquidity, saw an unprecedented peak in natural gas prices in August 2022 of more than EUR 300/MWh. This price level represented a tough test for both the region's energy markets and its industrial base, with production in a range of energyintensive industries forced lower or offline completely due to poor economics.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the pressure coming from high gas and power prices had moderated significantly. However, Europe's energy markets remain fundamentally tight. This fragility means the impact of disruptions to current supply sources is potentially very significant. LNG has taken on huge importance in meeting European demand for natural gas. Continued high imports of LNG into Europe to offset the loss of Russian pipeline flows requires Europe to outcompete Asia as the most attractive export destination for spot cargoes on the international market. This in turn requires Europe to have the most expensive natural gas market globally. 2022 saw wheels set in motion to change the European energy landscape faster than anybody would have anticipated at the beginning of the year but, for the time being, high energy prices should be expected to continue.\n\nNatural gas demand in Europe is expected to have fallen by some 10% during 2022 vs. 2021 based on a combination of factors, by far the largest of which is price-related demand reduction. Over the first half of 2022, it was residential and commercial demand for gas in Europe that was exhibiting the fastest demand declines. This was increasingly overtaken in the second half of the year as industrial gas demand fell rapidly as wholesale prices hit extremely high levels. Industrial gas demand is expected to have fallen some 20% year on year in Europe in 2022, far exceeding the estimated 3% decline in gas demand in the region's power generation.\n\nNatural gas was the standout performer in 2022 in price terms, but energy commodities as a whole led the market in a year when the majority of other asset classes declined. Major US and European stock indices were down significantly compared to the previous year, while bonds failed to provide any hedge against equity declines and posted their worst performance in decades in 2022. After European gas and electricity, other commodities whose price benefitted directly or indirectly from the fallout of the Ukraine conflict included coal and refined products, especially middle distillates such as diesel and heating oil. Despite high prices for refined products in 2022, Europe has seen new demand for middle distillates and some other products emerge from\n\nindustrial processes that have switched away from natural gas due to the extremely high prices in that market. The IEA estimates that this demand, comprising mostly gasoil, will average more than 500 kbbl/d over the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIt was a year of huge volatility in the Brent price. The first half of the year was defined by rapid demand growth, as oil consumption continued to recover from its 2020 lows. This contributed to the price rally in Brent, which peaked in Q2. However, supply was increasingly able to catch up. Non-OPEC supply is thought to have reached almost 67 mbbl/d by Q4/22, a 2 mbbl/d increase over the same quarter in 2021. At the same time, demand growth was starting to top out. High prices have also taken a toll on demand, which is estimated to have fallen in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year. Despite the marked decline in the Brent price in the latter part of 2022 on this softening fundamental picture, the annual average increase came in at around 40%. Industry investments have so far not exhibited any appreciable increase corresponding to the higher oil prices of the last two years.\n\nIn comparison to 2021, the olefin indicator margins were higher in 2022, driven by low feedstock prices except for the peak in the first quarter of 2022, and high monomer contract prices. On average for the year, indicator margins were on a healthy level. For some products, such as benzene, indicator margins reached historic highs in 2022 even though the market environment was challenging, which was caused by several factors, namely: the Russia/Ukraine conflict, high energy costs, high inflation, and decreasing demand throughout the year. Following the attack on Ukraine, the crude slate became lighter and naphtha was readily available in the market, which led to lower feedstock prices. Furthermore, high gas prices in Europe affected demand throughout the value chain. In summer, the low water level of the Rhine caused logistical constraints on the derivative market. All crackers in Europe reduced the throughput due to weak demand and high energy prices, especially in the second half of 2022. The cracker rates in Europe reduced to the globally near record low levels of 65% in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to extremely weak demand. French strikes and several cracker outages helped only a little in October. The entire supply chain was under the pressure of destocking as year end came to maximize cash and minimize inventory.",

In the second quarter of 2022, margins were supported by the heavy spring turnaround season. In the second half of 2022, however, margins deteriorated, with demand decrease seen across most grades of polyolefins due to the poor macroeconomic conditions (cost of living crisis reducing discretionary incomes of consumers). Imports of polyolefins into Europe were also ample in the second half of the year thanks to the easing of the global container freight market, which ended the year being similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nArguably the most significant result of the events of 2022 has been the reemergence of energy security as a key pillar of energy policy. The reality of overdependence on a single source of energy has been laid bare via numerous reversals on long-held policies, most notably German U-turns on coal and nuclear plant life spans, as well as a rapid build-out of infrastructure to import LNG into the region's largest economy. The sheer size of Europe's energy bill - and its impact on corporate competitiveness and household budgets should prevent energy security from being neglected in what's known as the energy trilemma at any time in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Crude price (Brent) - monthly average 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 ICE Brent generic 1st contract monthly average",

All three business segments contributed significantly, supported by the overall favorable market environment. Especially the Exploration & Production segment benefitted from the rise in oil and gas prices, while results were burdened by the impact of the war in Ukraine, including the change of the consolidation method of E&P Russian assets as well as supply curtailments in Gas Marketing Western Europe.\n\nGroup tax rate adjusted for special items and CCS effects. It represents the average rate at which the Group's profit before tax is taxed.\n\n## 2022 performance:\n\nComing in at 48%, the clean CCS Group tax rate increased by 12 percentage points compared to 36% in the previous year, stemming from an increased contribution from Exploration & Production, in particular from countries with a high tax regime.",

The gearing ratio excl. leases is calculated by net debt (interest-bearing debts including bonds less liquid funds) excluding leases divided by equity, expressed as a percentage.\n\n## 2022 performance:\n\nOMV's strong financial performance as well as positive contribution from inorganic cash flow from investing activities, such as the Borouge IPO, partial loan repayment from Bayport Polymers LLC (Baystar), as well as the sale of filling stations in Germany, have led to a continuous deleveraging throughout the year, resulting in a leverage ratio of 8%. The gearing ratio excluding leases came in at 3%.\n\nThe clean CCS ROACE (%) is calculated as Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT - as a sum of the current and last three quarters) adjusted for the after-tax effect of special items and CCS, divided by average capital employed (equity including non-controlling interests plus net debt).\n\n## 2022 performance:\n\nDriven by the strong operational performance, OMV was able to deliver a clean CCS NOPAT of EUR 5.7 bn in 2022, compared to EUR 3.8 bn in 2021.

A substantially higher contribution from the nitrogen business and the positive impact from stronger olefin margins were more than offset by considerably weaker European polyolefin margins, significantly lower positive inventory valuation effects, lower sales volumes in Europe, and a reduced contribution from the Borealis JVs.\n\nThe contribution of OMV base chemicals decreased despite higher ethylene and propylene indicator margins, mainly as a result of the planned turnaround of the Burghausen steam cracker and the incident at the crude distillation unit at the Schwechat refinery on June 3, 2022. The ethylene indicator margin Europe grew by 20% to EUR 560/t (2021: EUR 468/t), while the propylene indicator margin Europe increased by\n\n18% to EUR 534/t (2021: EUR 453/t). While the first half of the year was characterized by strong demand for olefins and supply shortages, the second half saw a sharp decline in demand, which was partially compensated for by lower operational rates of European crackers. Declining naphtha prices, after the peak in the first quarter, provided support to the olefins indicator margins in a very volatile market environment. Lower production due to the reduced utilization rate at the Schwechat and Burghausen steam crackers, higher costs of the feedstock mix, which also includes other intermediates besides naphtha, and growing utility prices weighed on the result.\n\nThe utilization rate of the European steam crackers operated by OMV and Borealis went down by 16 percentage points to 74% (2021: 90%). The utilization rate in 2022 came in lower as a result of the planned turnaround of the steam crackers in Burghausen and",

        "page_content": "Stenungsund, but also as a result of the incident at the crude distillation unit at the Schwechat refinery on June 3, 2022.\n\nThe contribution of Borealis excluding JVs declined by EUR 470 mn to EUR 967 mn (2021: EUR 1,437 mn). This was primarily due to substantially lower polyolefin indicator margins and significantly lower positive inventory valuation effects, while the outstanding performance of the nitrogen business and higher olefin indicator margins provided some support. The Borealis base chemicals business experienced a decline despite improved olefin indicator margins, mainly caused by negative inventory valuation effects and the impact from the planned turnaround at the Stenungsund steam cracker. The polyolefin business saw a strong decline in polyolefin indicator margins and substantially lower positive inventory valuation effects. In 2021, polyolefin indicator margins experienced historic highs, driven by strong demand in the European markets coupled with a tight supply-demand balance, as a result of a heavy maintenance season and worldwide logistical constraints. The polyethylene indicator margin Europe decreased by 33% to EUR 390/t (2021: EUR 582/t) while the polypropylene indicator margin Europe came down by 34% to EUR 486/t (2021: EUR 735/t). In the first half of 2022, polyolefin indicator margins started to normalize from the highs of 2021, at a slow pace to start, but deteriorated substantially in the second half of the year on the back of a slump in demand induced by the global economic slowdown and inflationary pressure on customers. In addition, increased availability of imported volumes into Europe put pressure on the margins. While the realized margins for standard products saw a substantial negative impact due to the emerging demand weakness and higher utility costs, margins for specialty products experienced slight improvements. Higher feedstock discounts and stronger prices, above market indicators, for certain product categories provided some relief. Polyethylene sales volumes went down by 7%, while polypropylene sales volumes decreased by 13% compared to 2021. The decrease in sales volumes stemmed mainly from the consumer products and infrastructure industries, while the mobility industry experienced a slight increase. The contribution from the nitrogen business saw a substantial increase compared to 2021. Fertilizer margins were substantially higher compared to 2021, as a tight supply situation more than offset the increased natural gas prices. The reclassification as asset held for sale also impacted the result positively.\n\nThe contribution of Borealis JVs declined by EUR 202 mn to EUR 332 mn (2021: EUR 534 mn), mainly due to lower contributions from Borouge and from Baystar. The favorable impact of a stronger USD managed to partially compensate for these effects. Polyethylene sales volumes from the JVs remained at the previous year's level, while polypropylene sales volumes from the JVs increased by 19%. In 2022, Borouge sales volumes benefited in particular from the ramp-up of the new polypropylene unit (PP5). A onetime effect from pension provisions negatively impacted the result in 2022 at Borouge, and the successful listing of 10% of Borouge's total issued share capital on June 3, 2022, lowered financial and operational contributions in comparison to 2021. The pricing environment in Asia weakened compared to 2021, as new polyolefin production capacities came online and consumer demand was dampened by COVID-19 lockdowns. Compared to 2021, Baystar experienced a softer market environment and was impacted by the full depreciation charge after the start-up of the ethane cracker and increased interest expenses, while the new unit experienced only a slow ramp-up in light of operational challenges.\n\nNet special items amounted to EUR 582 mn (2021: EUR (396) mn) and were mainly related to the successful listing of a 10% share in Borouge, which led to a gain from disposal of around EUR 0.3 bn. In addition, the binding offer received from AGROFERT for Borealis' nitrogen business triggered a write-up of around EUR 0.3 bn. The Operating Result of Chemicals & Materials came in at EUR 2,039 mn, compared to EUR 1,828 mn in 2021.\n\nCapital expenditure in Chemicals & Materials amounted to EUR 1,896 mn (2021: EUR 835 mn). The increase was driven by an equity injection to Borouge 4 of around EUR 0.4 bn in 2022 and growth in organic capital expenditure. In 2022, besides ordinary running business investments, organic capital expenditure was predominantly related to investments by Borealis in the construction of the new propane dehydrogenation plant in Belgium, which included non-cash effective CAPEX related to leases in the amount of around EUR 0.5 bn, the construction of the ReOil \u00ae demo plant in Austria, and the turnaround at the Burghausen refinery.",

The Company supplies services and products to customers around the globe through OMV and Borealis and its two joint ventures: Borouge (with ADNOC, based in the UAE and Singapore) and Baystar (with TotalEnergies, based in the United States).\n\nThe segment comprises the production of base chemicals integrated with OMV operated refineries in Austria and Germany, the Borealis business of base chemicals, polyolefins, and fertilizers, and the joint ventures Borouge and Baystar. With a strong European footprint through Borealis and its two joint ventures, Borouge and Baystar, the Group is active in over 120 countries.\n\n## Base chemicals\n\nBase chemicals are building blocks for the chemical industry and are transformed into plastics, packaging, clothing, and many other consumer products.\n\nWhile the refinery-integrated, OMV-operated steam crackers in Schwechat and Burghausen mainly use naphtha as a feedstock, the steam crackers operated by Borealis in Stenungsund and Porvoo feature high feedstock flexibility using naphtha, ethane, propane, butane, or any LPG mix as feedstock. In Kallo, Borealis runs a propane dehydrogenation unit based on 100% propane feedstock.\n\nThe OMV Group produces base chemicals such as olefins (ethylene, propylene, butadiene, and high-purity isobutene) and aromatics (benzene and phenol).\n\n- \u25b8 Ethylene and propylene are important chemical building blocks for producing polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene), for example, which are in turn used to manufacture a wide variety of consumer and industrial products.\n- \u25b8 C4s (e.g., butadiene and butene) are used in a variety of applications, with butadiene primarily used in manufacturing synthetic rubber, making it a fundamental material for the tire and automotive industries. Butenes are used in specialty chemicals, such\n- \u25b8 Aromatics such as benzene are used as starting materials for heat insulating materials and consumer products, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, computers, and sports equipment.\n- \u25b8 High-purity isobutene is a feedstock for key chemical products like adhesives, lubricants, and vitamins.\n\nas oxo-alcohols for plasticizers and polyols for coatings and synthetic lubricants.\n\n- \u25b8 Phenol and acetone are sold mainly to the polycarbonate and epoxy resin industries. Phenol is also used in phenolic resins and in caprolactam. Acetone is also an ingredient in solvents and MMA for PMMA (plexiglass).\n\nThe year 2022, was a challenging year with a very volatile market, which was caused by several main factors: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, high energy costs, high inflation, and decreasing demand across the year.\n\nIn comparison to 2021, the ethylene and propylene indicator margins were higher in 2022, driven by low feedstock prices, except for the peak in Q1/22, and high monomer contract prices. In Q1/22, even though the olefin market was tight, margins were negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. Starting from April 2022, naphtha availability in Europe increased due to lighter refinery feedstock and lower demand from China. Together with a healthy demand in the spring turnaround season this led to historically high margins in Q2/22. After July, both the ethylene and propylene markets became extremely long. All crackers in Europe reduced throughput based on weak demand and high energy prices. Low Rhine water levels caused logistical constraints on the derivative market throughout the summer months. As the market was struggling with these constraints, thanks to declining naphtha prices, the healthy indicator margin could be kept throughout Q3/22. However, demand did not improve from the summer lull into fall, the dramatic collapse in demand continued until the end of the year. The cracker rates in Europe reduced to global minimum levels of 60% to 65% in Q4/22 due to extremely weak demand.\n\nThe propane dehydrogenation (PDH) margin remained on a healthy level in the first half of 2022 on the back of a decent propane spread versus naphtha. Margins dropped severely in the third quarter, driven by lowering demand and a strengthening propane price versus naphtha due to higher propane demand, mainly in Asia. Margins improved again in the last quarter of the year driven by lowering propane demand due to lockdowns in China and a mild winter in Europe.",

        "page_content": "Butadiene demand was healthy in Q1/22, but with increasing naphtha prices, the indicator margins were at the lowest level of the year. Starting from May, supply was low due to reduced cracker rates on a long olefin market, however, the market was still balanced as the demand was low. The skyrocketing natural gas prices in Europe put its chemical industry under great strain, with high energy prices, a significant driver of inflation, and economic weakness lowering demand. Most producers had to add energy surcharges to their prices. The highest butadiene price and indicator margin of the year was achieved in August.\n\nFollowing the ISCC PLUS-certification at the Burghausen refinery in March 2022, OMV successfully sold its first ISCC PLUS certified benzene volumes this year. The benzene crack hit an all-time high in July at around EUR 900/t, however, the crack significantly weakened later in the year and reached around zero by year end due to volatile market conditions. Uncertainty in economics, logistical constraints and skyrocketing gas prices affected production costs and demand heavily.\n\n## Polyolefins\n\nThrough its subsidiary Borealis, OMV is the secondlargest polyolefin producer in Europe and among the top ten producers globally. Borealis operates seven polyolefin plants located in Schwechat, Stenungsund, Porvoo, and Burghausen, where they are integrated with steam crackers, as well as in Beringen and Kallo, where they are integrated with the existing PDH facility, and in Antwerp. In addition, Borealis operates several compounding plants in Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Brazil.\n\nThe value-add polyolefin products manufactured by Borealis are the foundation of many valuable plastics applications that are an intrinsic part of modern life. Advanced Borealis polyolefins have a role to play in saving energy along the value chain and promoting more efficient use of natural resources. Borealis works closely with its customers and industry partners to provide innovative plastics solutions that create value in a variety of industries and segments. These solutions make end products safer, lighter, more affordable, and easier to recycle. In short: They enable more sustainable living. Borealis offers advanced polyolefins for virgin and circular economy solutions, servicing the following key industries: consumer products, energy, healthcare, infrastructure, and mobility.\n\nFollowing the historically high levels reached in 2021, polyolefin margins slowly normalized in the first half of 2022, supported by a busy spring turnaround season, particularly in the second quarter. As of the third quarter, margins deteriorated due to plummeting demand resulting from the global GDP slowdown, and inflationary pressure on customers. In the meantime, the robust recovery of the international container freight market, which in December 2022 had approached preCOVID-19 levels, allowed imports to surge. Toward the end of the year, polyolefin margins recovered slightly thanks to low operating rates.\n\n## Renewables and circular chemicals\n\nPlastics continue to play a vital role in the economy and in our business, making our lives more efficient, convenient, and safe. Yet, when insufficient effort is made to recover and reuse plastics, most of them end up in landfill or incineration. The vision of a circular economy where we optimize resource efficiency and reuse, recycle and re-purpose endlessly is both a business imperative and an opportunity. Demand for recycled plastics is growing due to increasing public awareness of the importance of using resources sustainably to ensure a climate-neutral future.\n\nThe circular economy opens up new ways to reinvent the economy in the interest of preserving natural capital and minimizing waste. OMV and Borealis are pursuing various initiatives in mechanical and chemical recycling, Design for Recycling (DfR), and circular polyolefins that are manufactured with second-generation renewable feedstock. While mechanical recycling has proven to be effective and will likely remain the eco-efficient method of choice for the foreseeable future, chemical recycling will play an increasingly important role to complement it for hard-to-recycle materials.\n\nIn June, Borealis launched the Borvida\u2122 portfolio of circular base chemicals: Borvida\u2122 B is produced using non-food waste biomass, while Borvida\u2122 C is made of chemically recycled waste. The traceability of these ISCC PLUS-certified products - which include ethylene, propylene, butene, and phenol - is ensured thanks to the mass balance method of documenting and tracking renewable-based content across complex manufacturing systems. The Borvida\u2122 portfolio will be extended in due course with the Borvida\u2122 A range sourced from atmospheric carbon capture.",

        "page_content": "In October 2022, planning started for the construction of a novel and advanced commercial-scale mechanical recycling plant in Schwechat (Austria) to augment the three existing polyolefin recycling operations currently operated by Borealis in Europe. The plant will be based on the proprietary Borcycle\u2122 M technology, which transforms polyolefins-based post-consumer waste into high-performance polymers. Once operational in 2025, the new plant will have an annual production capacity in excess of 60,000 t. These large volumes will ensure the ample supply of high-quality recyclate so as to fulfill growing demand for circular products and solutions.\n\nSince 2021, Borealis has procured pyrolysis oil for the chemical recycling process from Belgium-based Renasci with which it manufactures Borcycle\u2122 C circular polyolefins and base chemicals at several of its own production locations. Since then, Borealis has gradually increased the stake it holds in Renasci: from 10% in 2021 to just over 27% in November 2022, and as of January 2023 to a current majority shareholding position of 50.01%.\n\nOMV is currently constructing a demo plant based on its proprietary ReOil \u00ae technology to scale up its chemical recycling capacities. The plant has a capacity of 16,000 t p.a. and is scheduled to start up in 2023. The feedstock will consist mainly of polyolefins and will be sourced in Austria in close cooperation with local waste management companies. Examples of such plastic waste include food packaging, plastic cups, lids from takeout coffee, and confectionery packaging. OMV's next step toward an industrial-scale plant with a processing capacity of up to 200,000 t/year is planned for 2026.\n\n## Fertilizers, melamine, and technical nitrogen products\n\nThrough its subsidiary Borealis, OMV is a leading European manufacturer and distributor of fertilizers, technical nitrogen products, and melamine: The Company is Europe's third-largest nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and the world's third-largest melamine producer by production capacity utilized.\n\nIn 2020, the OMV Group announced that it had started the divestment process for the nitrogen business unit, which includes fertilizers, technical nitrogen, and melamine. A binding offer received from EuroChem in February 2022 was declined in March after assessing the consequences of the war in Ukraine and related sanctions. In June 2022, Borealis received a binding offer from Czech-based AGROFERT that valued the business on an enterprise value basis at EUR 810 mn. Pending regulatory approval, closing is anticipated for the first quarter of 2023. The sale of the Company's share in Rosier, which operates the production sites in the Netherlands and Belgium, to Yilfert Holding was completed on January 2, 2023.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\n## Borouge (Borealis 36%, ADNOC 54%, free float 10%)\n\nEstablished in 1998, Borouge is a true success story of the long-term partnership with ADNOC. The joint venture has successfully combined the leading-edge Borstar \u00ae technology with competitive feedstock and access to growing Asian markets. Through Borouge, the Group's footprint reaches all the way to the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.\n\nIn June 2022, Borouge, became the largest-ever IPO in Abu Dhabi when it was listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX). The IPO offered 10% of Borouge's total issued share capital and raised over USD 2.0 bn in gross proceeds. It drew USD 83 bn in orders and was oversubscribed by nearly 42 times in aggregate.\n\n## Baystar (Borealis 50%, TotalEnergies 50%)\n\nBaystar is a joint venture between TotalEnergies Petrochemicals & Refining USA, Inc. (TEPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE, and Novealis Holdings LLC (Novealis), a wholly owned subsidiary of Borealis AG.\n\nTotalEnergies contributed its award-winning Bayport facilities to the JV and will be the operator of the cracker in Port Arthur. Borealis brings its proprietary Borstar \u00ae technology to North America for the first time along with the Bayport site for unique polyethylene grades for the most demanding applications.",

        "page_content": "## Growth projects\n\n## Borouge\n\nBorouge continued to drive growth in 2022. February saw the ground-breaking ceremony for Borouge 4, the new USD 6.2 bn facility under construction at the Borouge complex in Ruwais (UAE). Once operational, Borouge 4 will help meet growing demand for polymers in the Middle East and Asia, and will also supply feedstock to the adjacent TA'ZIZ Industrial Chemicals Zone. The successful start-up of PP5, the fifth Borouge polypropylene (PP) unit, also took place in February, boosting total Borouge PP capacity by more than 25%. The new PP5 unit is leveraging the proprietary Borstar \u00ae technology to deliver greater quantities of polymerbased material solutions for a wide range of industries, from packaging and consumer goods to pipe and infrastructure.\n\n## Baystar\n\nThe largest Borealis growth project underway in North America is the Baystar\u2122 joint venture with TotalEnergies in Port Arthur, Texas. A new ethanebased steam cracker was started up in July 2022. With an annual production capacity of 1 mn t of ethylene, the cracker supplies feedstock to Baystar's existing polyethylene (PE) units. In the future, it will also supply ethylene to the new, 625,000 metric-ton-per-year Borstar \u00ae PE unit once construction and ramping up have been completed. Baystar is a crucial growth anchor as it enables Borealis to bring Borstar to North America for the first time.\n\n## Kallo\n\nProgress was made in the first half of 2022 at the new world-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant in Kallo (Belgium). However, construction was stopped after misconduct on the part of the site's contractor, IREM, was uncovered. Borealis suspended, then terminated all contracts with IREM and its subcontractors due to non-compliance with fundamental contractual principles. Work resumed in October following a re-tendering process. Start-up of the new PDH plant is expected in the second half of 2024. Borealis has zero tolerance for non-compliance in all aspects of its operations and has since implemented more extensive controls and monitoring measures to ensure full future compliance.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nOMV's ReOil \u00ae proprietary thermal cracking technology was developed to meet the European Commission's targets for the circular economy and to fulfill future packaging recycling quotas. The ReOil \u00ae plant at the Schwechat refinery, which has a capacity of 100 kg/h, has been recycling post-consumer and post-industrial plastics into synthetic crude oil using a pyrolysis process since 2018. This synthetic crude is then processed mainly into monomers and other hydrocarbons in the Schwechat refinery. The pilot plant has been running for a total of 18,000 hours since its commissioning, enabling improvements in the thermal cracking process and supporting the further scale-up of the ReOil \u00ae technology. OMV and Borealis are pursuing the clear ambition of becoming a leading player in chemical and mechanical recycling technologies. In November 2022, OMV has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Wood, a global leader in consulting and engineering solutions in energy and materials markets, to enter into a mutually exclusive collaboration agreement for the commercial licensing of OMV's proprietary ReOil \u00ae technology.\n\nAt Borealis, innovation is fundamental for contributing to the circularity of polyolefins and creating a more sustainable way of life. It also helps the Group improve its competitiveness and enhance its efficiency and sustainability - and therefore has a direct impact on people, the planet, and profit. Borealis is investing in R&D and new technologies in order to accelerate Value Creation through Innovation, particularly in the circular sphere.\n\nAround 500 people are active in R&D at the Borealis Group. This figure includes scientists and researchers at the Innovation Headquarters in Linz (Austria) and the two innovation centers in Stenungsund and Porvoo.\n\nBorealis continues to be among the top-ranked companies in Austria with respect to patent filings. In 2022, Borealis filed 128 new priority patent applications at the European Patent Office. This is just short of its previous record of 133 patent applications filed in 2021. As of January 2023, the Borealis Group holds around 11,500 individual patents or patent applications which are subsumed in approximately 1,450 patent families. The growing number of patents is proof positive of the Group's dedication to Value Creation through Innovation.\n\nThe K 2022 trade fair held in Germany in October was the ideal stage for showcasing the many new products and material solutions generated through innovation",

        "page_content": "and collaboration. Center stage was taken by the Borstar \u00ae Nextension technology, a step change for performance-based polyolefins. The unique combination of Borstar \u00ae technology and single-site Borstar \u00ae Nextension catalysts improves PP properties and produces a wider range of tailored polyolefins. Borstar \u00ae Nextension facilitates easier recycling because its use in multilayer applications allows for the replacement of multiple different materials with only one material; it thus encourages design for recycling by enabling monomaterial solutions. The single-site catalysts for this breakthrough technology are manufactured at a newly built Borealis plant in Porvoo (Finland). Two BorPure\u2122 and a nonwoven grade based on Borstar \u00ae Nextension technology were also launched in October, each offering superior performance combined with circularity and material efficiency.\n\nGrades from the Bornewables\u2122 portfolio of premium circular polyolefins based on renewably sourced feedstocks are being used to develop an increasing number of novel applications, many of which are generated through value chain collaboration. To name just a few of the products made using grades from the Bornewables\u2122 range and presented at the K 2022: the MAM Original Pure climate-neutral baby pacifier, a coffee-togo cup in the Tupperware ECO+ product line, a reusable and fully recyclable lightweight plastic bottle co-developed by Borealis and Trexel, and a series of rigid food packaging applications based on Bornewables\u2122 and Borcycle\u2122 C co-developed by Borealis and ITC. In the Pipe sector, collaboration with Uponor resulted in the first PE-X pipes based on Bornewables\u2122 feedstock, while co-operation with NUPI produced nextgeneration PP-RCT pipes based on Bornewables\u2122.\n\nOther circular highlights of 2022 include three fully recyclable, PE monomaterial pouch solutions; lightweight and ultra-lightweight reusable cups made of Borealis PP using the patented Bockatech EcoCore plastic foaming technology; a series of flexible packaging formats incorporating 50% PCR; and the world's first shoe made from carbon emissions, On's Cloudprime, containing high-performance, easy-to-process ethylene vinyl acetate foam supplied by Borealis. In June, the first Borcycle\u2122 M jacketing compound containing up to 50% PCR was launched, thereby promoting enhanced circularity in the Wire & Cable sector. Finally, in the automotive sector, Borealis announced in October that collaboration with Tier One supplier Magna had produced the first and largest-ever all-thermoplastic tailgate for the new Volkswagen Multivan, a prime example of customer-centric innovation resulting in high-performance yet lighter-weight parts that help reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nStepping up digitalization in Chemicals & Materials is one of the key drivers for transformation. Not only will it increase the Group's productivity and improve the customer experience, it will also support the achievement of sustainability goals. In particular, digital solutions for the circular economy of plastics will become more important for the success of the Group's carbon neutrality journey.\n\nFor that reason, Borealis decided in 2017 to implement a digital program and to create a state-of-the-art IT and digital organization, which led in 2018 to the creation of the Borealis Digital Studio in Brussels (Belgium). The Digital Studio is Borealis' creative and agile enabler for developing smart solutions for customers and employees. It consists of a diverse, cross-functional team of digital professionals, including designers, usability experts, business analysts, software developers and engineers. Its mission is to support the Group's businesses as they adapt to a rapidly changing environment and to keep Borealis sustainably profitable, by creating innovative digital solutions that have a positive impact on the Group, its people, and the environment. Adding value is key when creating digital solutions and end-users are always at the heart of the process, as the solutions are built both with and for them, following the agile methodology. Together with the Borealis IT organization, the Digital Studio explores innovation options with the business functions.\n\nAn innovative game-based interactive learning solution helps employees and contractors learn the Group's Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Rules in a very immersive way, allowing them to apply theory to practice without stopping production or risking injury. The training combines a 3D-modeled plant environment, an engaging story, and motivating gamification elements to simulate safety scenarios, enabling people to learn faster and retain knowledge better than traditional methods. In addition, Borealis has explored virtual reality technology to complement existing training methods and support the Group's journey to reach Goal Zero.\n\nBorealis is employing artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve quality. A solution that uses image recognition to trace contamination has been rolled out to multiple locations across the Group. It gives customers peace of mind by ensuring they receive very clean polymer material, which is especially relevant for high-voltage insulation applications in the Energy business. In addition, Borealis' plastic recycling businesses are using AI to improve their intake quality and waste sorting,",

It puts easy order management at the customers' fingertips, along with a complete library of order, product, and complaint documentation. The application works around the clock, providing instant access to up-to-date information, with ordering fully integrated with supply chain and IT processes. A single global portal supports eight languages, allowing organizations in Europe, North America, and South America to use it. By the end of 2022, 20% of the order volume came in via the portal, up from 18% at the start of the year.\n\nBorealis has developed a solution for recording and following up on the condition of equipment at its plants. The integrated digital tool allows the operator to access and enter real-time data in the field, using tablets compliant with ATEX, the two European Directives for controlling explosive atmospheres. Additionally, a failure prediction model using Borealis' cloud-based data and analytics platform has been rolled out on rotating equipment. The model allows live anomaly detection and will be adapted for other equipment types, contributing to higher reliability for the Group's production assets. Other initiatives to increase reliability include introducing autonomous robots with sensors for monitoring data points from equipment, using smart glasses to enable skilled experts to provide remote assistance in the field, and creating a Group-wide data platform containing 3D scans of critical spare parts. To better support Borealis' complex activities in plant turnarounds, a Management Tool for Turnaround and Projects has been rolled out, which fully integrates planning and progress reporting on work orders, as well as the Go4Zero tool, which supports safety follow-up for employees and contractors.\n\nAt the K 2022 trade fair, Borealis presented Neoni, a new carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions calculator that is currently under development. This digital tool is the first in the industry to offer CO2e emissions data down to the grade level for polyolefins, providing more transparency to Borealis' customers so they can make informed decisions on which materials best meet their circularity goals. Neoni offers a partial carbon footprint of products from Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), in the form of cradle-to-gate CO2e emissions. This means the calculation includes all CO2e emissions incurred up to the moment the grade leaves Borealis' facilities. The tool will soon offer customers the option to calculate additional CO2e emissions incurred from Borealis to their own operations, further enhancing its usefulness. Neoni presents CO2e emissions for a wide range of materials, from virgin, fossil feedstock-based solutions to renewable feedstock-based grades in the Bornewables\u2122 portfolio of circular polyolefins, as well as those in the Borcycle\u2122 portfolio of mechanically recycled polyolefins. The results from the tool will be accessible to customers on MyBorealis, the online platform for Borealis customers.",

For comparison only, 2021 figures are presented based on the new calculation logic.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe clean CCS Operating Result increased significantly to EUR 2,415 mn (2021: EUR 945 mn). Exceptional refining indicator margins, a significantly better result in Gas & Power Eastern Europe, and a remarkable ADNOC Refining & ADNOC Global Trading result more than compensated for the negative production effects following the turnaround and incident at the Schwechat refinery, higher costs driven by turnaround activities, and a lower retail result.\n\nThe OMV refining indicator margin Europe went up sharply to USD 14.7/bbl (2021: USD 3.7/bbl). Higher cracks for diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel were only partially offset by rising fuel and losses due to the further Brent price increase, and lower heavy fuel oil cracks. In 2022, the utilization rate of the European refineries decreased by 15 percentage points to 73% (2021: 88%), mainly caused by the turnaround and the incident at the Schwechat refinery, as well as the turnaround at the Burghausen refinery in the second and third quarters of 2022. At 15.5 mn t, fuels and other sales volumes in Europe decreased slightly by 5%, mainly as a consequence of lower supply availability in Schwechat and the divestment of the German retail business, partly offset by higher jet fuel\n\nsales volumes. The result of the commercial business declined slightly, mainly due to the price cap regulations in several countries, especially in Hungary and Slovenia. This was partially offset by increased demand for jet fuel driven by the easing of travel restrictions. The contribution from the retail business to the result decreased significantly, mainly driven by the divestment of the German retail network in May 2022, higher utilities costs, lower fuel unit margins following the price caps in several countries, and higher fixed costs driven by inflation. This was partially offset by better performance in the non-fuel business and costcutting efficiency measures.\n\nIn 2022, the contribution of ADNOC Refining & ADNOC Global Trading to the clean CCS Operating Result grew substantially to EUR 350 mn (2021: EUR (11) mn), mainly as a result of higher refining margins, and robust operational performance at ADNOC Refining. In addition, ADNOC Global Trading provided strong support to the result compared to the same period of the previous year.",

        "page_content": "The contribution of the Gas & Power Eastern Europe business to the result more than tripled to EUR 605 mn (2021: EUR 188 mn), mainly due to the positive impact of increasing gas selling prices, high gas margins on gas transactions outside Romania, and better power results due to higher margins following higher power selling prices. This was partially offset by Petrom Gas & Power being significantly regulated through extended scope of capped prices and of overtaxation, for both gas and power.\n\nNet special items amounted to EUR 774 mn (2021: EUR (924) mn) and were primarily related to the sale of the German filling stations in May 2022 and commodity derivatives. In 2021, special items were mainly related to an impairment in ADNOC Refining in the amount of EUR (669) mn. CCS effects of EUR 202 mn were recorded in 2022 as a consequence of increasing crude oil prices. The Operating Result of Refining & Marketing rose substantially to EUR 3,392 mn (2021: EUR 451 mn).\n\nCapital expenditure in Refining & Marketing amounted to EUR 821 mn (2021: EUR 633 mn). Organic capital expenditure in 2022 was predominantly related to the European refineries and the retail network. The increase in capital expenditure in 2022 was mainly due to turnaround activities, repair works at the Schwechat refinery, and investments in the co-processing unit at Schwechat.\n\n## Business overview\n\nThe Refining & Marketing business segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks, and markets fuels as well as natural gas and power. Its activities include Refining, Supply and Trading, Commercial, Retail, and Gas & Power Eastern Europe. OMV owns a total refining capacity of around 500 kbbl/d, with three wholly owned refineries in Europe and a 15% share in ADNOC Refining and ADNOC Global Trading. In Europe, refining activities are highly integrated with marketing to serve a strong branded retail network and a broad base of commercial customers. Total fuels and other sales volumes Europe amounted to 15.51 mn t in 2022. The strongly branded retail network comprising 1,803 filling stations accounts for around 40% of the sales volumes, while commercial customers are mainly from industrial transportation and construction sectors and account for the remaining sales volumes. In the Gas & Power Eastern Europe business, OMV Petrom operates a gasfired power plant in Romania and is engaged in gas and power sales.\n\n## Refining including product supply and sales\n\nThroughout 2022, we saw exceptional refining margin strength. A boom in benchmark refining margins took hold from the end of the first quarter, when middle distillate tightness really started to become apparent. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which was followed by a raft of 'self-sanctioning' measures by western firms in the trade of Russian oil, contributed significantly to this tight picture. Resurgent demand in the first half of the year also exposed significant tightness in the global refining system's ability to supply additional distillate volumes.\n\nThis distillate tightness was consistently the driver of refining economics over the course of the year. With Russia's established role as a key supplier of distillate molecules into the European market severely curtailed, the value of distillate molecules in Europe surged. This peak was sustained throughout the second quarter, with ultra-low sulfur diesel in Rotterdam averaging a premium of close to USD 50/bbl to Dated Brent over the quarter. Jet quotations tracked a similar high-premium path. The refining system's struggle to meet demand was also evident in the rate at which inventories were drawn down in high-visibility hubs over the first half of the year. A significant degree of tightness in the production capacity of core refined products can in part be attributed to a raft of capacity losses since the high water mark for demand in 2019.\n\nLate in the second quarter turned out to be the high point for benchmark margins, as refinery supply increasingly caught up with demand as the year progressed. As product supply increased in response to the unprecedented rally in middle distillate and gasoline cracks over the second quarter, headwinds in naphtha and heavy products became increasingly apparent. Naphtha cracks versus Brent in Europe lost more and more ground over the first half of 2022, averaging a discount of more than USD 35/bbl versus Dated Brent in June and posting only a moderate recovery over the second half of 2022. Demand for naphtha remained weak as petrochemical margins remained under significant pressure. Fuel oil cracks similarly failed to post any appreciable recovery from the declines seen over the first part of the year. High-sulfur fuel oil in Rotterdam came off its mid-year lows when it was trading at a discount of more than USD 40/bbl versus Dated Brent, but remains heavily discounted.",

        "page_content": "The extreme divergence of product cracks throughout 2022 reflects the forced rearrangement of interregional crude and product flows as Russia, a major supplier of both, was shut out of many importing markets. At the same time, European in particular and to some extent Asian gross margins had to reflect the much higher cost of refinery production (i.e., energy and refinery fuel) throughout 2022, which is itself a function of the changes in the European natural gas market on the back of geopolitical upheaval. In sum, the cost of supplying the marginal diesel barrel to the market in 2022 was significantly higher than in 2021.\n\nOMV's European refineries achieved a utilization rate of 73% in 2022, which was influenced strongly by the planned turnaround activities in the Schwechat and Burghausen refineries, and the incident at the crude oil distillation unit in Schwechat. During the legally required water pressure test as part of the final work on the OMV Schwechat refinery's turnaround, significant damage occurred to the crude oil distillation unit on June 3, following a mechanical incident. After repair work completed in record time, and without a single incident, the crude oil distillation unit resumed full operations on October 7, 2022.\n\nDespite the challenging environment caused by the unstable geopolitical situation and the incident at the Schwechat refinery, commercial sales delivered ahead of expectations in many areas. The Operating Result was mainly driven by well-executed price management, even with lower volume availability. To closely reflect the market developments and market outlook, OMV's commercial products and services are being expanded, including the launch of several new, more sustainable products. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), for example, contributes to a reduction of CO2 emissions of more than 80% as a result of processing regionally sourced used cooking oil. Starting with the production of around 2 kt of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in 2022, OMV plans to scale production up and to market 700 kt per year by 2030. In terms of sales, OMV is already delivering SAF to Austrian Airlines at Vienna Airport. In addition, MoU agreements with Lufthansa, Ryanair and Wizz Air were signed in 2022, for the supply of up to 1,145 kt SAF in the period 2023-2030.\n\n## ADNOC Refining & Trading\n\nAlongside majority shareholder ADNOC (65%) and Eni (20%), OMV is a strategic partner in ADNOC Refining after acquiring 15% of the company's shares at the end of July 2019. In 2022, ADNOC Refining operated its major refinery in Ruwais, which is the world's fourth largest refining complex with integrated petrochemicals.\n\nIn comparison to 2021, in 2022 the ADNOC Refining business benefitted from a higher margin environment and improved operational performance. With the same ownership structure as ADNOC Refining, ADNOC Global Trading (AGT) trades the majority of ADNOC Refining's export volumes of products and supplies non-domestic crudes, condensates, and other liquids for processing.\n\nAGT extends the successful Refining & Marketing business model into key geographic regions and to strategic partners. By continuously optimizing trade flows, it allows ADNOC Refining to access competitive non-domestic feedstock sources and implement best practices such as risk management.\n\nDuring 2022, AGT performance was strong, continuing to pursue its business ambition and substantially growing its third-party trading.\n\n## Refining capacities 2022\n\n|                                         |   In kbbl/d |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Schwechat (Austria)                     |         204 |\n| Burghausen (Germany)                    |          79 |\n| Petrobrazi (Romania)                    |          86 |\n| ADNOC Refining (United Arab Emirates) 1 |         138 |\n| Total                                   |         507 |\n\n1 Equivalent to OMV's 15% share in ADNOC Refining\n\n## Retail\n\nDespite a challenging environment due to both the war in Ukraine and the shortage in supply, mostly as a result of the crude oil distillation unit incident at the Schwechat refinery, the retail business achieved a remarkable result in 2022 and proved again to be a stable outlet for refinery products and a strong cash generator.\n\nTotal sales partially recovered to 6.1 mn t, equivalent to approximately 7.6 bn l, strongly supported by an ongoing growing cards business. At the end of the year, the network comprised 1,803 filling stations (2021: 2,088). OMV especially benefitted from its proven multi-brand strategy in this challenging price environment. The OMV brand is positioned as a premium brand, with VIVA representing a strong shop, gastronomy, and service offering, while the unmanned Avanti brand in Austria and the Petrom brand in Romania serve price-sensitive customer groups. Sales of OMV's premium-brand fuels MaxxMotion have been under pressure due to the overall consumer price environment, but still contributed to the overall Retail result as a high margin product. The non-fuel business, including VIVA convenience stores and car washes, continued to grow and",

In multiple countries, the loyalty system has been successfully upgraded by utilizing state-of-the-art digital solutions.\n\nThe OMV network partners with third parties to provide EV-charging facilities at more than 150 sites, and has introduced the first OMV owned and operated EV chargers in Austria. Further investments in OMV's own EV-charging infrastructure will be one of the strategic key pillars within the Retail business. Approximately 380 sites are equipped with photovoltaic installations, underlining OMV's focus on sustainability and resilience.\n\nFollowing a clear strategy of active portfolio management, OMV has decided to divest certain parts of its retail network. Closing of the divestment of the OMV network in Germany (285 filling stations) to the EG Group took place in April 2022. The announced divestment of OMV Slovenia (118 filling stations) to the MOL Group is dependent on the Merger Clearance process carried out by EU authorities. Furthermore, a divestment agreement was signed for Avanti Germany comprising the sale of 17 unmanned filling stations to PKN Orlen in December 2022.\n\n## Gas & Power Eastern Europe\n\nIn 2022, the European gas market was characterized by unprecedented high gas prices and significant volatility. This situation is expected to continue.\n\nSimilarly, in Romania, both gas and power markets faced unseen volatility and unpredictability levels with high prices and a drop in demand. A series of regulatory interventions and market constraints significantly impacted operations and results, and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nIn Romania, OMV Petrom's gas and power activities once again delivered a record high Operating Result, reflecting outstanding business performance built on the profitable optimization of product, market, and customer portfolios. Natural gas sales volumes to third parties reached 35.8 TWh in 2022 compared to 38.4 TWh in 2021, a very strong performance given the market environment. As the overall market demand was significantly down, OMV Petrom's gas volumes covered an increasing share of the overall consumption. OMV Petrom managed to source high gas volumes from third parties, thus successfully covering its sales channels. In addition, activities in the neighboring markets, both for gas and power, have been expanded, laying a strong foundation for further extension of our regional\n\nfootprint. Gas transactions executed outside Romania, diversifying the supply portfolio with LNG, and the enlarged customer portfolio (including small businesses and even residential customers) were successfully managed, improving the results.\n\nOMV Petrom's net electrical output increased to 5.01 TWh, +5% compared to 2021, and a record high level of production since the start of operations. The Brazi power plant covered around 9% of the national power generation mix, reaching a record high contribution to the security of the national power system. The Brazi power plant celebrated in August 2022, ten years since its commissioning, having generated over 34 TWh of electricity during this period. Looking forward, the Brazi power plant remains a pillar of the Romanian power market, natural gas being a good fit for renewable energy.\n\n## Nord Stream 2\n\nOMV is a financial investor in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project along with four other European companies. In 2022, OMV decided to impair the entire outstanding loans and accrued interest (approximately EUR 1 bn). For further details, please refer to Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates, section 'Impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related significant estimates and assumptions'.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nOMV actively explores alternative feedstocks, technologies, and fuels with the aim of developing a well-diversified, competitive future portfolio. Additional attention is given to the production of conventional and advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, and green hydrogen as precursors for sustainable feedstock for chemicals.\n\nOMV is in the execution phase of the Co-Processing project at the Schwechat refinery. This technology enables OMV to process biogenic feedstocks (e.g., domestic rapeseed oil) together with fossil-based materials in an existing refinery hydrotreating plant during the fuel refining process. This will reduce OMV's carbon footprint by up to 360,000 t by substituting fossil diesel. Operations are scheduled to begin in 2023. In 2022, OMV started pilot production of Sustainabile Aviation Fuel (SAF) from another co-processing route in Schwechat, and completed the first conversion runs of biogenic feedstock to ethylene in the refinery in Burghausen.\n\nOMV secured a long-term contract with AustroCel Hallein to supply OMV with advanced bioethanol totalling up to 1.5 mn l per month starting in January 2021.

        "page_content": "will reduce emissions by around 45,000 t of CO2 per year.\n\nOMV is assessing the potential production of advanced fuels made out of residue or waste streams. Unlike conventional biofuels, the use of advanced fuels is not capped. The principal sources of advanced fuels include biomass fraction from mixed municipal or industrial waste, straw, animal manure, or residues from forestry and wood processing, as well as waste streams. OMV is currently constructing a pilot plant for the conversion of advanced glycerine to propanol. Commissioning is expected in the second half of 2023. OMV also collaborates with technology providers, industry partners, and academic institutions to assess the production of advanced biofuels and chemicals.\n\nWhile the above mentioned bio- and synthetic products will predominantly be sold as fuels initially due to a mandated market, they can also be used as chemical feedstock.\n\nOMV and its partners are working on the UpHy project with the intention of producing green hydrogen for use in both the mobility sector and the refining process. OMV is building an electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery for this purpose, to be powered with renewable electricity in order to produce zero-carbon hydrogen. The green hydrogen will initially be used for fuel hydrogenation, including biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuels.\n\nOMV, together with partners including BASF and thyssenkrupp Uhde, has initiated the consortium Methanol-to-SAF (M2SAF). The aim of the M2SAF project is to develop a novel process technology to facilitate the selective production of SAF that can be used as a dropin fuel up to 100%. This production process should generate only minimal additional CO2 emissions and should be easy to integrate into existing production plants. The starting point of the process is sustainably produced methanol from CO2 and green hydrogen. As part of the overall concept of renewable fuels, the M2SAF development project is being funded to the tune of EUR 3.1 mn by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV). In addition to catalyst development, process development, plant integration, and the design of a demo plant, the project also includes techno-economic and environmental analysis, as well as related support for the certification and analysis of the new jet fuels.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nDigitalization remains a significant part of optimizing our value and operational efficiency with activities in 2022 bringing EUR 26 mn benefit over the coming four years. Highlighted examples for 2022 include:\n\nA digitalized predictive cleaning schedule for the heat exchangers in our crude distillation units in Austria and Romania resulted in both better energy efficiency and higher throughput. These data-driven optimizations generated savings of EUR 1.7 mn p.a. and contributed to our sustainability targets by saving approximately 37,000 t CO2 p.a.\n\nOur new digital Customer Engagement Platform saw the launch of our customer portal in 2022, which enables customers to enjoy the benefits of a modern collaboration platform with features such as instant information on placed orders or checking available credit lines.\n\nThe significant digital milestone for our retail business came with the launch of the OMV MyStation app, a mobile app that went live in 2022 in five countries. The app had already counted approximately 402,000 users by the end of 2022, and digitalized OMV's loyalty program, among other functions. To further improve the customer experience, future functionality will aim to also include options in the areas of sustainability and customer service. The loyalty club, enhanced by the app, contributed to an increase in our premium fuels share, which for a loyalty member is double that of a nonmember (34% share of premium fuels for members).\n\nOver the last two years, the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has automated 107 routine processes and delivered benefits of over EUR 2.8 mn of year-on-year savings.",

Exceptionally strong market effects of EUR 5,280 mn as a consequence of substantially higher oil and gas prices were partially offset by negative operational effects of EUR (679) mn due to the missing contribution of Russia following the change in the consolidation method, and a substantially lower Gas Marketing Western Europe result. In addition, production decreased in Romania, Malaysia, and Libya, while production increased in the United Arab Emirates after a revision of OPEC+ restrictions. Sales volumes decreased to a slightly lesser extent compared to production as a consequence of the scheduling of liftings. Depreciation of EUR (97) mn weighed on results, mainly driven by higher production in the United Arab Emirates and Norway. Gas Marketing Western Europe lowered the result, mainly due to losses caused by the Russian supply curtailments and volatility, receivables impairments, and valuation adjustments. A change in the reporting logic for LNG activities had a partially positive offsetting effect.\n\nNet special items amounted to EUR (460) mn in 2022 (2021: EUR 18 mn), which were mainly caused by the change in the consolidation method for Russian operations and the fair value adjustment to contractual position related to the reserve redetermination for the Yuzhno-Russkoye natural gas field. Valuation effects of commodity derivatives in Gas Marketing Western Europe and temporary hedging effects were partial offsets. The release of a provision in the LNG business also had a positive effect. The Operating Result reached EUR 6,936 mn (2021: EUR 2,910 mn).\n\nProduction cost excluding royalties increased to USD 8.2/boe in 2022 (2021: USD 6.7/boe), mainly driven by the change in the consolidation method of Russian operations as of March 1, 2022, and general price inflation.\n\n## The total hydrocarbon production volume\n\ndecreased by 95 kboe/d to 392 kboe/d, caused above all by the change in the consolidation method of Russian operations as of March 1, 2022.

It was mainly related to activities in Malaysia, Romania, and Norway.\n\n## Production\n\n|                          | 2022         | 2022         | 2022         | 2022                 | 2021         | 2021         | 2021         | 2021                 |\n|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|\n|                          | Oil and  NGL | Natural gas\u00b9 | Natural gas\u00b9 | Total                | Oil and  NGL | Natural gas\u00b9 | Natural gas\u00b9 | Total                |\n|                          | in mn bbl    | in bcf       |              | in mn boe  in mn boe | in mn bbl    | in bcf       |              | in mn boe  in mn boe |\n| Romania\u00b2                 | 20.9         | 122.0        | 22.6         | 43.5                 | 22.4         | 129.9        | 24.0         | 46.4                 |\n| Austria                  | 3.3          | 19.7         | 3.3          | 6.6                  | 3.6          | 20.6         | 3.4          | 7.0                  |\n| Kazakhstan\u00b2              | -            | -            | -            | -                    | 0.7          | 0.7          | 0.1          | 0.8                  |\n| Norway                   | 14.7         | 102.2        | 17.0         | 31.7                 | 15.3         | 102.3        | 17.0         | 32.3                 |\n| Libya                    | 10.4         | -            | -            | 10.4                 | 12.0         | -            | -            | 12.0                 |\n| Tunisia                  | 0.9          | 14.7         | 2.4          | 3.4                  | 0.9          | 17.3         | 2.9          | 3.8                  |\n| Yemen                    | 0.6          | -            | -            | 0.6                  | 1.1          | -            | -            | 1.1                  |\n| Kurdistan Region of Iraq | 1.0          | 15.8         | 2.6          | 3.6                  | 1.0          | 15.6         | 2.6          | 3.6                  |\n| United Arab Emirates     | 15.4         | -            | -            | 15.4                 | 10.8         | -            | -            | 10.8                 |\n| New Zealand              | 3.0          | 47.1         | 7.8          | 10.8                 | 3.5          | 51.8         | 8.6          | 12.1                 |\n| Malaysia\u00b2                | 0.6          | 60.0         | 10.0         | 10.6                 | 1.7          | 64.5         | 10.8         | 12.4                 |\n| Russia                   | -            | 37.7         | 6.3          | 6.3                  | -            | 210.6        | 35.1         | 35.1                 |\n| Total                    | 70.8         | 419.2        | 72.1         | 143.0                | 72.9         | 613.2        | 104.6        | 177.5                |\n\n- 1 To convert natural gas from cf to boe, the following conversion factor was applied in all countries: 1 boe = 6,000 cf. In Romania, the following factor was used: 1 boe = 5,400 cf.\n- 2 The figures above include 100% of all fully consolidated companies.\n\n## Portfolio developments\n\nThe year 2022 marked the highest financial results for E&P, with a record clean CCS Operating Result of EUR 7.4 bn, driven by high oil and gas prices. Despite the production and supply impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, E&P has formed strategy implementation teams to focus on key strategic initiatives and made progress with identifying options for optimizing its portfolio, as well as starting the development of its Low Carbon Business. Shortly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, OMV deconsolidated the participation in the Yuzhno-Russkoye natural gas field and ceased to consider Russia as a core region. Total average hydrocarbon production came in at 392 kboe/d for 2022, with a natural gas share of around 50%.\n\nThe key strategic focus of the E&P segment remains to increase the share of natural gas over that of crude oil and reduce carbon intensity across the portfolio. In 2022, E&P progressed well with its five major natural gas development projects: Neptun (Romania), Jerun (Malaysia), Berling (Norway), Ghasha (UAE), and M\u0101ui B (New Zealand).\n\nIn 2019, OMV New Zealand announced the intended divestment of its 69% interest in the Maari field to Jadestone Energy. After ongoing engagement with Jadestone Energy, a mutual decision has been made to no longer pursue the transaction. In Yemen, the sales contract for OMV's assets in the country were signed in December 2022. In Norway, the farm-out agreements for a 20% interest in the Oswig and Velocette licenses were signed on May 9, 2022, to Longboat Energy. On February 27, 2023, OMV announced",

Bhd. and 100% of the shares in OMV New Zealand Limited.\n\nIn Q1/22, E&P integrated the Gas Marketing Western Europe business from Refining & Marketing. In light of market developments, E&P set up a Gas Task Force assigned with the following duties: ensuring that storage facilities in Austria were filled to 100% before the gas winter season 2022/23, establishing new payment conditions with Gazprom Export while complying with European sanctions, and securing additional supply contracts and pipeline capacities, mitigating the risk for OMV.\n\n## Central and Eastern Europe\n\nIn Romania, 55 new wells and sidetracks were drilled and 647 workover jobs performed. Also, 700 subsurface abandonments were performed in 2022. OMV Petrom successfully and safely finalized the major planned maintenance works at both offshore and onshore facilities. One new well was particularly successful in 2022, as it was put into production in the same year with excellent results.\n\nOMV Petrom continued to focus on the most profitable barrels and there are ongoing activities related to selective divestments.\n\nIn Austria, the second and final phase of the photovoltaic plant Sch\u00f6nkirchen was commissioned successfully in 2022. The plant now delivers total peak production of 15.32 MWp for a total power generation of around 15.84 GWh p.a. In 2022, OMV Austria placed significant emphasis on process safety topics. Hazard and operability studies were performed in seven facilities.\n\n## Middle East and Africa\n\nIn 2022, the Middle East and Africa region delivered strong production results despite a challenging security situation in Libya, Kurdistan, and Yemen. Operations were frequently disrupted and some projects delayed.\n\nThis strong production was due to an easing of the OPEC quota and several OMV-driven initiatives to improve the uptime and reliability of the offshore facilities in Umm Lulu and SARB in the UAE.\n\nIn Libya, in the first half of the year, the production from our non-operated assets was heavily constrained due to several force majeure events. This production deferment was induced by security shutdowns as a result of the political instability in the country. But as soon as\n\nproduction there came back on stream by mid-July, it remained stable until the end of the year.\n\nIn Yemen, production was stable for most of 2022 until political unrest started in Q4/22 and disrupted the shipping of crude oil for all oil and gas companies in the country.\n\nIn Tunisia, stable production at the Nawara natural gas field was maintained. The front-end compression system execution project started in 2022 and an infill drilling project will commence in 2023. Both projects aim at increasing the life span of field production at the Nawara asset.\n\n## North Sea\n\nIn Norway, several new production wells have come on stream.\n\nOn Gullfaks, nine wells were delivered. The Gudrun Phase 2 Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) project was completed. This project consists of one infill well, two water production wells, and two water injectors. Infill drilling on Edvard Grieg was completed during 2022 and all five wells from the Solveig field are now producing toward the Edvard Grieg platform.\n\nThe Hywind Tampen offshore wind project is now delivering renewable wind power to the Gullfaks field.\n\nBerling (formerly known as Iris/Hades) progressed to FID followed by the submission of the Plan for Development and Operations (PDO) to the Norwegian Ministry in December 2022.\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\nThe Jerun natural gas project in Malaysia is progressing according to plan. Detailed engineering is well on track, and the first deliveries of structural steel have arrived at the fabrication yard.\n\nIn New Zealand, OMV continued the redevelopment and optimization of the M\u0101ui and Pohokura natural gas assets.\n\nThroughout this, the operations team have remained focused on keeping the gas flowing and prioritizing opportunities to further reduce site emissions.\n\nIn Pohokura, the infill well was hooked up to the Pohokura onshore facility, with the well producing as expected.",

        "page_content": "Workovers at Maari continued through to the end of 2022, and a strong focus on asset integrity and corrosion management has allowed for life span extension initiatives to be pursued with no major issues identified to date.\n\n## Key projects\n\n## Neptun (Romania, OMV 50%)\n\nStarting in August 2022, OMV Petrom is now operator of the Neptun Deep offshore license block with new non-operating partner Romgaz. The Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) was successfully submitted to Romanian authorities in December 2022. The declaration of commercial discovery, while a significant milestone, represents an intermediate step in the process of making the final investment decision. Together with its new partner, OMV Petrom is planning FID in mid-2023.\n\n## Other major projects (Romania, OMV 100%)\n\nThe successful completion of an exploration well in July 2022 led to the discovery of large resources in the X Craiova Block. It is currently in experimental production. This discovery unlocks significant development opportunities, including the drilling of appraisal and development wells in the coming years.\n\nThe commissioning of a photovoltaic park in 2022 marked a first for OMV Petrom. As part of an energy efficiency program, we will use the power it generates for our own consumption within the Exploration & Production segment.\n\nThe Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) project consisting of the injection of viscous salt water started in May 2022 and has been producing initial results.\n\n## Umm Lulu and SARB (United Arab Emirates, OMV 20%)\n\nRecord production was achieved in the Umm Lulu and SARB fields in 2022. Throughout most of the year, only a minimal OPEC quota was applied, so that production in both fields was close to its full potential.\n\nDevelopment drilling continued during the year, using five rigs in total. Seven wells in SARB and 13 wells in Umm Lulu were drilled, while 22 new wells were brought on stream.\n\n## Ghasha concession (United Arab Emirates, OMV 5%)\n\nThe Ghasha concession is being developed as three projects in parallel, namely Hail & Ghasha, the Dalma project (containing several fields in the Dalma area),\n\nand the Deep Gas Development (also containing several fields). The Hail & Ghasha megaproject reached several milestones in 2022, with four out of the eleven artificial islands being completed.\n\nIn the Dalma project, activities on the onshore and offshore Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) packages are progressing, with first gas targeted by the middle of the decade.\n\n## Khor Mor (KRI, OMV 10%)\n\nThe Khor Mor field exceeded production expectations despite several insurgent attacks during the year. Due to the deteriorating security situation since June, construction work on the Khor Mor expansion project is currently on hold. The operator will evaluate the situation in the first half of 2023.\n\n## Gullfaks (Norway, OMV 19%)\n\nIn 2022, the Equinor-operated Gullfaks field delivered strong production volumes, mainly due to reduced natural gas injection. Norway's first floating wind farm Hywind Tampen started electricity production in November 2022. The wind farm is expected to meet about 35% of the field's electricity demand. By the end of 2022, seven out of eleven turbines had started production. The remaining four were assembled in late 2022 and will be installed onsite during 2023. Nine wells were part of the Gullfaks annual activity program in 2022.\n\n## Gudrun (Norway, OMV 24%)\n\nThe water injection project Gudrun Phase 2 has started on the Gudrun field in the North Sea. The Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) project will increase the oil recovery from the main reservoir on the field and extend production lifetime by two years, changing the drainage strategy from pressure depletion to pressure support by water injection.\n\n## Berling (Hades/Iris) (Norway, OMV 30%)\n\nAs the operator, OMV changed the name of the Hades/Iris field development project to Berling. The project is progressing toward FID followed by the submission of the PDO to the Norwegian Ministry in December 2022. Offers for rig charters are currently being reviewed. Production start-up is expected in 2028.\n\n## SK408 (Malaysia, OMV 40%)\n\nIn Malaysia, the phase 1 development of the SK408 license (the Gorek, Larak, and Bakong fields) continued to produce at a high level.\n\nPhase 2 of the license, the Jerun project, is progressing well according to the construction plan.

Works continue on the installation of mechanical equipment, piping spools, and pulling electrical and instrument cables for topsides.\n\n## M\u0101ui A Crestal Infill (New Zealand, OMV 100%)\n\nTwo additional MACI wells following the successful drilling program earlier this year were started. Drilling is expected to be completed in 2023.\n\n## M\u0101ui B IRF Phase 3 (New Zealand, OMV 100%)\n\nThe project scope of the M\u0101ui B IRF Phase 3 infill drilling comprises the drilling, completion, tie-in, and commissioning of five sidetrack wells on the M\u0101ui B platform. Three out of the five wells were delivered during 2022.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal highlights\n\nIn 2022, OMV, OMV Petrom, and SapuraOMV drilled twelve exploration and appraisal wells in six different countries. Eight of these wells were completed before year end, while the other four were either drilling or testing in early January 2023.\n\nOMV operated or participated in a number of key wells, including two successful appraisals in offshore UAE, natural gas/condensate discoveries in Norway and Tunisia, and a successful natural gas appraisal well in New Zealand. OMV Petrom drilled three onshore exploration wells in Romania resulting in two oil discoveries. The SapuraOMV-operated Kanga drilling in Australia was completed in June 2022. The well did not discover any producible hydrocarbons.\n\nThe drilling of four wells in Austria, New Zealand, the UAE, and Mexico was still ongoing at year end. These are expected to be finalized in Q1/23 or Q2/23.\n\nExploration and appraisal expenditure slightly decreased to EUR 202 mn in 2022 (2021: EUR 210 mn).\n\nEarlier in the year, SapuraOMV was awarded a 40% working interest in a Production Sharing Contract for the Offshore Exploration Block SB412 in Malaysia.\n\nLooking to Q1/23, new wells scheduled for spudding in January are foreseen in Romania, New Zealand, and Tunisia.\n\n## Reserves development\n\nProved reserves (1P) as of December 31, 2022, decreased to 1,037 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom: 380 mn boe), with a one-year Reserve Replacement\n\nRate (RRR) of (80)% in 2022 (2021: 77%). The threeyear rolling average RRR is 40% (2021: 105%). There were material proved reserves additions realized in Norway and the United Arab Emirates, with a commitment to execute more development drilling and encouraging reservoir performance in both countries. These additions were offset by the exclusion of reserves in Russia since OMV ceased fully consolidating and equity accounting Russian entities. Proved plus probable reserves (2P) decreased to 1,892 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom: 741 mn boe), dominated by the exclusion of reserves in Russia, which overshadowed the positive revision in Romania from the maturation of the Black Sea Neptun Deep project.\n\n## Gas supply, marketing, and trading\n\nOMV markets and trades natural gas in eight European countries. In 2022, natural gas sales volumes amounted to 111.2 TWh (2021: 156.8 TWh). The foundation of the natural gas sales business is a diverse supply portfolio, which consists of equity gas from Austria and Norway (amounted to 36.3 TWh in 2022) and a variety of international suppliers. In addition to mid- and long-term activities, short-term activities at Europe's main international trading hubs complement OMV's supply portfolio.\n\nOMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH's (OMV GAS) sales activities are focused on a diverse customer portfolio in the large-scale industry and municipality segments in Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Italy, Slovenia, and France are covered by opportunistic origination activities.\n\nIn 2022, the importance of the LNG business increased enormously and OMV fully utilized its allotted capacity at the Gate regasification terminal in the Netherlands. Several LNG contracts for 2023 and 2024 have already been concluded and concern non-Russian gas only. This makes the LNG business a very important building block for OMV to diversify the natural gas supply portfolio, thereby enhancing supply security.\n\nIn 2022, the European natural gas market was characterized by the unprecedented energy market crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine, with very high natural gas prices, extreme price volatility, and unpredictable supply cuts from Russia. This situation is expected to continue.\n\nDegrading market conditions and deteriorating supply reliability drove OMV to restructure its natural gas business in 2022. A task force has been set up to minimize the adverse effects stemming from the war in Ukraine,",

        "page_content": "while securing a continuous and diversified supply stream. This involves regular reporting of the security of supply status regarding OMV's portfolio in terms of the overall natural gas supply situation, storage filling levels, and a continuous definition and adjustment of hedging strategies that mitigate the inherent price risk of gas supply disruptions. Natural gas supply diversification strategies were defined and executed, and OMV has successfully secured additional natural gas transportation capacities. Furthermore, OMV was able to fully utilize the capacity of its storage facilities. These measures have succeeded in securing OMV's portfolio and in increasing the resilience of the supply situation for the coming years. This will mitigate the impact of Russian gas supply curtailments in Germany and Austria.\n\n## Gas logistics\n\nOMV operates natural gas storage facilities in Austria and Germany with a capacity of 30 TWh. Additionally, OMV holds a 65% stake in the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH), the leading natural gas trading hub in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe unprecedented energy market crisis caused by the war in Ukraine has had a significant impact on the European storage market. The storage utilization period of 2022 started with very low levels all over Europe. Global demand, based on recovery from the pandemic, shortage of supply, and market uncertainty due to the war led to an inverse summer/winter spread, with summer prices exceeding winter prices. European regulations concerning storage filling levels and unprecedented volatility of prices across the entire energy complex dominated the market. In this difficult environment, OMV was able to fill its storage capacity in Austria and Germany to 100% by mid-October 2022, storage level at year end was at 97%.\n\nAt the Central European Gas Hub, 633 TWh of natural gas was nominated at the Virtual Trading Point (VTP) in 2022. This volume corresponds to approximately seven times Austria's annual natural gas consumption. The EEX CEGH Gas Market traded total volumes of 425 TWh in Austria, an increase of 84%, and 51 TWh in the Czech Republic, an increase of 79%.\n\n## Low Carbon Business\n\nBy 2030, OMV aims to invest around EUR 5 bn in lowcarbon geothermal energy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and further renewable power solutions like photovoltaic or onshore and offshore wind power generation. OMV will also explore opportunities in energy\n\nstorage solutions, e.g., subsurface storage of hydrogen.\n\nWith these investments, OMV expects to generate an operating cash flow of EUR 0.5 bn per annum by 2030. All of the above-mentioned targets play a key role in OMV's Strategy 2030.\n\nE&P started 2021 with the establishment of a dedicated Low Carbon Business unit, which has since gained significant momentum, both on a national and an international level, with a variety of initiatives started and several projects initiated and/or executed.\n\nOMV conducted a production and injection test in fall 2022 to analyze the geothermal potential in the Vienna Basin (Lower Austria). The test took place in the basement of the Vienna Basin. The aim of the geothermal test was to determine important reservoir parameters and to obtain samples of the formation water in order to decide whether this formation is suitable for producing geothermal energy for direct heat use.\n\nIn Germany, OMV has a 50% interest in a geothermal exploration project called Thermo in Lower Saxony. This involves a small aircraft taking gravity and magnetic measurements over an area of around 5,000 km\u00b2 to gather geological information. This information will be used to assess the geothermal energy potential and will be part of a comprehensive evaluation of future geothermal activities in the area.\n\nIn partnership with Complexul Energetic Oltenia (CE Oltenia), OMV Petrom will build four photovoltaic (PV) parks with a total power capacity of ~450 MW. According to current estimates, the PV parks should supply electricity to the national energy system starting 2024. Further opportunities for photovoltaic projects in Lower Austria, as well as in other Austrian and international locations, are currently under evaluation.\n\nA strong focus of the OMV Low Carbon Business is on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), particularly to support the hard-to-abate industry sectors in their goal of reducing their CO2 emissions. One of OMV's focus areas is offshore Norway, where currently, several CCS opportunities and projects are being assessed together with dedicated, experienced partners.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nThe Innovation & Technology department provides key expertise and cutting-edge technologies to ensure OMV's strategic goal of decarbonization and becoming a net-zero emissions company.",

Digitalization and innovation will play a key role on this journey. The tools and systems we have been putting in place for the E&P division over the last several years, as well as the new ways of working in cross-geographical, multidisciplinary teams are bearing fruit and will enable us to apply the available technology in new markets, such as low-carbon business.\n\nIn 2022, OMV joined forces with partners to implement the innovative DELFI environment across the majority of our operated ventures. This subsurface data and interpretation platform allows multidisciplinary teams to collaborate using the same data, both onsite and remotely. Over the course of the year, over 200 users and almost 1 petabyte of data were migrated to the new public cloud platform using over 80 individual applications. In 2023, the full rollout of DELFI across the organization will be completed.\n\nBuilding on the successful implementation of the DELFI platform, OMV's best-in-class machine learning-supported stochastic reservoir modeling and decision analysis workflow was implemented in DELFI. The workflow is based on the results of the OMV-Stanford University project. The workflow leads to the integration of energy production optimization, economics, and decision-making. It includes OMV proprietary elements.\n\nConstruction of our Operations Cockpit began at our base in G\u00e4nserndorf (Austria). Once completed, it will connect experts globally to optimize production and operating costs.\n\nOMV implemented a 3D intelligent digital twin and augmented reality inspection and maintenance tool for our operations in New Zealand, significantly enhancing the preparation and planning of maintenance activities there. We are utilizing the 3D visualization of our facilities to build inspection plans and complete the inspections using iPads and the HoloLens.\n\nIn 2022, OMV continued to automate its drilling activities. We commissioned the construction of the first automated onshore rig in OMV's portfolio in Romania as part of our automated well delivery process. The automatic rig will improve HSSE performance by removing people from the rig's danger zones. It will increase drilling efficiency by reducing time and costs due to a more effective execution of tasks. We expect that it will help us reduce the overall drilling cost per well by almost 10%. In addition, CO2 emissions will be reduced by 80 t per well.\n\nFollowing our AI (Artificial Intelligence) Strategy, we have established a new AI Ecosystem capability to foster the increasing importance of AI and Machine Learning (ML). The ecosystem provides all of the organizational, technical, and process-related prerequisites for delivering customer-centric AI and ML products, so as to enable the in-house development of AI use cases and products by our Data Analytics experts.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\nAs an international oil, gas, and chemicals company with operations extending from hydrocarbon exploration and production through to the trading and marketing of mineral oil products, chemical products, and natural gas, OMV is exposed to a variety of risks - including market and financial risks, operational risks, and strategic risks. The Group's risk management processes focus on the identification, assessment, and evaluation of such risks and their impact on the Group's financial stability and profitability. The objective of these activities is to actively manage risks in the context of the Group's risk appetite and defined risk tolerance levels in order to achieve OMV's long-term strategic goals.\n\nIt is OMV's view that the Group's overall risk is significantly lower than the sum of the individual risks due to its integrated nature and the fact that various risks partially offset each other. The balancing effects of industry risks, however, can often lag or weaken. OMV's risk management activities therefore focus on the net risk exposure of the Group's existing and future portfolio. The interdependencies and correlations between different risks are also reflected in the Company's consolidated risk profile. Risk management and insurance activities are centrally coordinated at the corporate level by the Treasury and Risk Management department. This department ensures that well-defined and consistent risk management processes, tools, and techniques are applied across the entire organization. Risk ownership is assigned to the managers who are best suited to oversee and manage the respective risk.\n\nThe overall objective of the risk policy is to safeguard the cash flows required by the Group and to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating in line with the Group's risk appetite.\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks are regularly identified, assessed, and reported through the Group's Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process.\n\nThe main purpose of the OMV Group's EWRM process is to deliver value through risk-based management and decision-making, which is ensured by applying a 'three lines of defense' model (1. business management, 2. risk management and oversight functions, 3. internal audit). The assessment of financial, operational, and strategic risks helps the Group leverage business opportunities in a systematic manner. This ensures that OMV's value grows sustainably. Since 2003, the EWRM system has helped enhance risk awareness and improve risk management skills across the entire organization, including at subsidiaries in more than 20 countries. The OMV Group is constantly enhancing the EWRM process based on internal and external requirements, for instance developing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting standards and frameworks.\n\nA cross-functional committee chaired by the OMV Group CFO with senior management members of the OMV Group - the Risk Committee - ensures that the EWRM process effectively captures and manages material risks across the OMV Group.\n\nThe process is facilitated by a Group-wide IT system supporting the established individual process steps: risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment, reporting, and risk review through continuous monitoring of changes to the risk profile. The overall risk resulting from the bottom-up risk management process is computed using Monte Carlo simulations and compared against planning data. This is further combined with a top-down approach from the senior management view to capture risks associated with the Group's strategy. The process also includes companies that are not fully consolidated. The EWRM process uses common risk terminology and language across the OMV Group to facilitate effective risk communication, whereby ESG risks play a key role in the OMV risk taxonomy. Twice a year, the results of this process are consolidated and presented to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. In compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the effectiveness of the EWRM system is evaluated by an external auditor on an annual basis. The key financial and non-financial risks identified with respect to OMV's medium-term plan are:\n\n- \u25b8 Financial risks including market price risks and foreign exchange risks\n- \u25b8 Operational risks, including all risks related to physical assets, production risks, project risks, personnel risks, IT risks, HSSE, and regulatory/compliance risks\n- \u25b8 Strategic risks arising, for example, from climate change, changes in technology, risks to reputation, or political uncertainties, including sanctions",

        "page_content": "## Financial Risk Management\n\nMarket price and financial risks arise from volatility in the prices of commodities, including the market price risks from European Emission Allowances, foreign exchange (FX) rates, and interest rates. Also of importance are credit risks, which arise from the inability of a counterparty to meet a payment or delivery commitment. As an oil, gas, and chemicals company, OMV has a significant exposure to oil, natural gas, and chemicals prices. Substantial FX exposure includes the USD, RON, NOK, NZD, and SEK. The Group has an economic net USD long position, mainly resulting from oil production sales. The comparatively less significant exposure in RON, NOK, NZD, and SEK, originating from expenses in local currencies in the respective countries.\n\n## Management of commodity price risk, FX risk, European Emission Allowances\n\nThe analysis and management of financial risks arising from foreign currencies, interest rates, commodity prices, European Emission Allowances, counterparties, liquidity, and insurable risks are consolidated at the corporate level. Market price risk is monitored and analyzed centrally in respect of its potential cash flow impact using a specific risk analysis model that considers portfolio effects. The impact of financial risks (e.g., commodity prices, currencies) on the OMV Group's cash flow and liquidity are reviewed quarterly by the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CFO and comprises the senior management of the business segments and corporate functions.\n\nIn the context of commodity price risk and FX risk, the OMV Executive Board decides on hedging strategies to mitigate such risks whenever deemed necessary. OMV uses financial instruments for hedging purposes to protect the Group's cash flow from the potential negative impact of falling oil and natural gas prices in the Exploration & Production segment.\n\nIn the Refining & Marketing and Chemicals & Materials businesses, OMV is especially exposed to volatile refining and chemicals margins and natural gas prices, as well as inventory risks. Corresponding optimization and hedging activities are undertaken in order to mitigate those risks. They include margin hedges as well as stock hedges. An optimization, trading, and hedging risk control governance system defines clear mandates including risk thresholds for such activities. In addition, Emission Compliance Management ensures a balanced position of emission allowances by selling the surplus or covering the gap.\n\n## Management of interest rate risk\n\nTo balance the Group's interest rate portfolio, loans can be converted from fixed to floating rates and vice versa according to predefined rules. OMV regularly analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on interest income and expenses from floating rate deposits and borrowings.\n\n## Management of credit risk\n\nSignificant counterparty credit risks are assessed, monitored, and controlled at the Group and segment level using predetermined credit limits for all counterparties, banks, and security providers. The procedures are governed by guidelines at OMV Group level. In light of a challenging geopolitical and economic environment with high inflation, volatile commodity prices, rising interest rates, and distorted supply chains, special attention is paid to early warning signals like changes in payment behavior.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nThe nature of OMV's business operations exposes the Group to various health, safety, security, and environmental (HSSE) risks. Such risks include the potential impact of natural disasters, as well as process safety and personal security events. Other operational risks comprise risks related to the delivery of capital projects or legal/regulatory non-compliance. All operational risks are identified, analyzed, monitored, and mitigated in accordance with the Group's defined risk management process. Control and mitigation of assessed risks take place at all organizational levels using clearly defined risk policies and responsibilities. The key Group risks are governed centrally to ensure the Group's ability to meet planning objectives through corporate directives, including those relating to health, safety, security, environment, legal matters, compliance, human resources, and sustainability.\n\nThe process safety incident at the Schwechat refinery that occurred on June 3, 2022, has led to a delayed start-up of the refinery after the regular maintenance turnaround. Immediately after the incident, a broadbased on-site task force was set up with the remit of investigating the incident and at the same time working on restoring operations. At the end of September, the legally required water pressure test on the main column of the crude distillation unit was successfully completed. After the precisely prepared commissioning process, the OMV Schwechat refinery was fully restarted in mid-October. For the duration of the repairs, OMV had successfully established an alternative supply system to ensure continuous supply to its customers.",

        "page_content": "## Project risks\n\nIn implementing its Strategy 2030, OMV will invest in both organic and inorganic growth projects following a mature project risk management process, identifying, analyzing, and monitoring project risks on a regular basis. OMV has vast experience in managing major capital projects and mitigating project risks.\n\nOMV may experience operational, political, technological, or other risks beyond its control, both of its own and of its contractual partners, which may delay or hinder the progress of its projects.\n\nBy way of example, the execution of major onshore and offshore projects in Romania, Norway, or the UAE may be affected by changes to the respective regulatory or fiscal frameworks, by the unavailability of contractors, or the lack of qualified staff. Project costs may be negatively impacted by price inflation, labor shortages, or the disruption or reorganization of supply chains. Projects, in particular in recycling and sustainable fuels and feedstocks, may be affected by insufficient availability of required feedstock supply, by the inability to commercially scale up new technologies, or by the lack of regulatory clarity. In new business areas in particular, OMV may more often invest through partnerships and joint ventures, which may expose the Company to increased governance and credit risks and may negatively impact project execution. The effect of any of these risks may have a material adverse impact on OMV's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n## ESG risk\n\nOMV places special emphasis on five Sustainability focus areas: Climate Change; Natural Resources Management; People; Ethical Business Practices; and Health, Safety, and Security.\n\nOMV Executive Board members regularly (at least quarterly) discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, related developments in the fuels, chemicals, and natural gas markets, the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations, the status of innovation project implementation, and progress on achieving sustainability-related targets. OMV focuses on assessing the potential vulnerabilities of the Company to climate change (e.g., water deficiency, droughts, floods, landslides), the impact of the Company on the environment, and the mitigation actions that will ensure a successful transition to a low-carbon environment (e.g., carbon emission reductions, compliance with new regulatory requirements). The short- and mid-term physical vulner-\n\nabilities related to climate change are identified and reported in the EWRM process; they do not exceed OMV's reporting threshold. Additionally, OMV has performed a robust climate and vulnerability assessment for most of its main assets to identify its resilience to physical risks related to climate change using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios corresponding to the time horizon suggested by the EU taxonomy.\n\nOMV's operations impact our employees and the communities where we operate. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, OMV follows the Human Rights Due Diligence Process, including the assessment of the human rights risk associated with our current and future business activities, and taking risk management actions. This ongoing process makes use of external resources and expertise, and includes external stakeholders, in particular impacted groups.\n\nIn July 2022, upon becoming aware that the authorities were conducting an investigation into alleged human trafficking practices by a (sub)contractor at the propane dehydrogenation plant construction site in Kallo (Belgium), Borealis immediately offered support and provided all requested information to the authorities, in full transparency. Borealis immediately suspended and later terminated all contracts with the respective (sub)contractor. Borealis has zero tolerance for any malpractice and puts stringent measures in place to mitigate related risks. After careful consideration, Borealis granted the majority of the works to a different contractor and implemented thorough social controls at the Kallo construction site. Work on the construction site gradually increased from October 2022. The prolonged standstill and gradual restart of the project might affect the project timeline.\n\n## IT risks\n\nAs OMV's activities rely on information technology systems, the Group may experience disruption due to major cyber events. Security controls are therefore implemented across the Group to protect information and IT assets that store and process information. IT-related risks are assessed, monitored regularly, and managed actively with dedicated information and security programs across the organization. OT (Operational Technology) related risks are reflected in the assessment of process safety risks.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic risks\n\nIn order to identify strategic risks that might have potentially long-term effects on the Company's objectives, OMV continuously monitors its internal and external environment.\n\n## Geopolitical and regulatory risks\n\nOMV thoroughly monitors geopolitical developments, in particular the ongoing Russian war on Ukraine and any additional sanctions and countersanctions resulting from it. The Company regularly reviews the impact of potential further escalations on its business activities. Continued and/or intensified disruptions in Russian commodity flows to Europe could result in further increases in European energy prices. Sanctions on Russia and countersanctions issued by Russia could lead to further disruptions in global supply chains and shortages of products related to energy, raw materials, agriculture, and metals, and consequently lead to further increases in operational costs.\n\nOMV experienced ongoing curtailments of natural gas delivery volumes purchased by OMV under long-term supply agreements with Gazprom in Germany and Austria. This required replacement purchases on the market as well as adjustments to OMV's hedging ratios, resulting in a negative financial impact for OMV. The uncertainty regarding future curtailments and delivery volumes remains and could result in further substantial losses, especially if actual deliveries materially deviate from previously hedged volumes, thus leading to partially unmitigated gas price exposure from Gazprom supply contracts.\n\nIn the event of further, or even full, natural gas supply disruptions from Russia, OMV can use gas in storage to supply customers and has access to other liquid gas market hubs in Europe. Additionally, OMV managed to secure 40 TWh of additional transport capacities to Austria for the current gas year (October 1, 2022-September 30, 2023) at Oberkappel (pipeline from Germany) and Arnoldstein (pipeline from Italy) transfer points. OMV continues to closely monitor developments and regularly evaluates the potential impact on the Group's cash flow and liquidity position.\n\nHigh volatility in natural gas prices can potentially lead to peak liquidity demands to satisfy margin calls for exchange trading activities at short notice. OMV has unused committed and uncommitted credit facilities to meet such short-term requirements if needed. OMV is responding to the situation with targeted measures to safeguard the Company's economic stability as well as the secure supply of energy.\n\nAs a direct consequence of the energy crisis in Europe, regulatory measures like price caps, subsidy schemes, and the EU solidarity contribution are being implemented in some of the countries OMV is active in. New regulatory and fiscal interventions may also impact the financial position of the OMV Group. The Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 introduced a solidarity contribution, which was transposed into the local legislation of the Member States by the end of 2022 and applies to 2022 and/or 2023. It represents a contribution of surplus profits of companies operating in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, and refinery sectors. It is calculated based on the taxable profits of those companies, as determined under national tax rules, that are more than 20% higher than the average taxable profits generated in the period 2018 to 2021. Based on the legislation in Austria, it is expected that two Austrian entities of the OMV Group will be subject to the solidarity contribution (Energy Crisis Contribution) for the second half of 2022. Romania transposed this regulation via GEO 186/2022, approved and published in December 2022. This Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) will subsequently follow the parliamentary approval process, so it may be subject to change. Based on OMV Petrom's 2022 accounts and the provisions of this Emergency Ordinance, OMV Petrom is not subject to the EU solidarity contribution for the fiscal year 2022, having less than 75% of its turnover in the defined areas: extraction of crude, extraction of natural gas, extraction of coal, and refining business. No solidarity contribution is expected for OMV Group entities in Germany for the year 2022 either.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned geopolitical tensions, OMV's operations are exposed to further geopolitical risks such as the expropriation and nationalization of property, restrictions on foreign ownership, civil strife and acts of war or terrorism, and political uncertainties, in particular related to Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia, as well as other countries where OMV operates and has financial investments. However, OMV has extensive experience in dealing with the political environment in emerging economies. Also, possible regulatory changes may lead to disruptions or limitations in production or an increased tax burden. OMV continuously observes political and regulatory developments in all markets that affect OMV's operations. Country-specific risks are assessed before entering new countries.",

The hybrid bond bears a fixed interest rate of 2.875% per annum until, but excluding, June 19, 2024.

The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.\n\nThe hybrid notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, do not have a scheduled maturity date and they may be redeemed at the option of OMV under certain circumstances. OMV has, in particular, the right to repay the hybrid notes at certain call dates. Any accrued unpaid interest becomes payable when the notes are redeemed. In the case of a change of control, for example, OMV may call the hybrid notes for redemption or else the applicable interest rate will be subject to an increase",

The most important elements of the internal control and risk management system regarding the accounting process are the following: Governance for the internal control system is defined by internal corporate regulations (ICS Directive and its Annexes). Corporate Internal Audit controls the compliance with these principles and requirements through regular audits, based on the annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, or through ad hoc audits.\n\nThe results of those audits are presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. For the main 'end-to-end' processes (e.g., purchaseto-pay, order-to-cash), Group-wide Minimum Control Requirements are defined. Based on a defined time plan, the implementation and the effectiveness are being monitored. The establishment of Group-wide standards for the preparation of annual and interim financial statements by means of the corporate IFRS Accounting Manual is also regulated by an internal corporate regulation. The Group uses a comprehensive risk management system. The essential processes of the financial reporting system have been identified and analyzed. In addition, the effectiveness of the risk management system is regularly evaluated by external auditors. The results of the evaluation are reported to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\n- 12. In accordance with section 267a Paragraph 6 of the Austrian Commercial Code, a separate consolidated non-financial report will be issued.\n\n## Subsequent events\n\n- \uf026 Please refer to Note 37 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The implementation of the policy and the performance outcomes of the financial year under review are set out in the Remuneration Report for OMV's Executive Board and Supervisory Board, which has been prepared annually since the 2020 financial year.

in particular supervising the Executive Board and advising it on strategy - by discussing the Company's situation and objectives during board meetings. Decisions are also taken at these meetings, except in urgent cases where resolutions can be taken by circular vote. Five committees ensure that the best possible use is made of the Supervisory Board members' expertise. Brief descrip-\n\ntions of these committees are given below (see also the Report of the Supervisory Board for an overview of the individual committees' main activities in 2022). In 2022, 8 meetings of the Supervisory Board and 28 committee meetings were held. In particular, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board discussed OMV's strategy. Christoph Swarovski attended fewer than half of the meetings of the Supervisory Board. Saeed Al Mazrouei attended fewer than half of the meetings of the committees he has been elected to.",

The Supervisory Board may transfer other duties and powers of approval to the Presidential and Nomination Committee on an ad hoc or permanent basis. In its capacity as the Nomination Committee, this body makes proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment or replacement of Executive Board members and deals with succession planning. It also makes recommendations for appointments to the Supervisory Board. There were five meetings of the Presidential and Nomination Committee in 2022, in which discussions focused on Executive and Supervisory Board matters.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThis committee performs the duties established by section 92 (4a) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The committee held seven meetings during the year. It predominantly dealt with preparations for the audit of the annual financial statements, a review of the auditors' activities, internal audit, the internal control and risk management systems, the presentation of the annual financial statements as well as the procedure for the selection of the statutory auditor (Group auditor). Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell is the financial expert on the Audit Committee within the meaning of section 92 (4a) (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## Auditors\n\nThe Supervisory Board monitors the auditors' independence and reviews a breakdown of the audit fees and fees for additional services besides auditing activities. In 2022, the auditors Ernst & Young Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (including their network within the meaning of section 271b of the Austrian Commercial Code) received EUR 3.47 mn for the annual audit, EUR 0.60 mn for other assurance services, EUR 0.19 mn for tax advisory services, and EUR 0.40 mn for other engagements.\n\n## Portfolio and Project Committee\n\nThis committee supports the Executive Board in preparing complex decisions on key issues where necessary and reports on these decisions and any recommendations to the Supervisory Board. In 2022, five meetings of the Portfolio and Project Committee were held.\n\n## Sustainability and Transformation Committee\n\nThe purpose of the Sustainability and Transformation Committee is to support the Supervisory Board in reviewing and monitoring OMV's strategy with regard to sustainability, as well as ESG-related standards, performance, and processes. It also focuses on performance specifically in terms of HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and Environment) and in particular regarding climate change. Furthermore, the committee serves to support and oversee the transformation process toward a more sustainable business model, including the cultural integration of strategically significant acquisitions. The committee held four meetings during the year.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThis committee deals with all aspects of the remuneration of Executive Board members and with their employment contracts. The committee's membership does not include employee representatives. The committee is empowered to conclude, amend, and terminate Executive Board members' employment contracts and to",

        "page_content": "make decisions on the awarding of bonuses (variable remuneration components) and other such benefits to them. The Remuneration Committee met seven times during 2022. Executive Board members were invited to attend parts of some of the meetings of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe hkp/// group was hired by the Remuneration Committee to provide remuneration advice to the committee on the appropriate structure and level of Executive Board compensation in line with regulatory requirements and market practice.\n\nBased on the results of a benchmarking study carried out by the hkp/// group, the remuneration of OMV's Supervisory Board was adjusted in 2022.\n\nThe hkp/// group also provided advice on the creation of OMV's Remuneration Report. The consulting company did not advise the OMV Executive Board on matters relating to Executive Board remuneration, ensuring independence with respect to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and dealings by members of the Supervisory Board requiring approval\n\nThere were no transactions requiring approval in accordance with section 95(5) (12) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Attention is drawn to the fact that the Supervisory Board members Mark Garrett and Elisabeth Stadler are, or were in the reporting year, chairpersons of the executive boards of companies with which supply contracts and insurance and related contracts, respectively, were concluded under normal market and industry terms and conditions (including consideration). Although these contracts do not raise concerns in relation to a potential conflict of interest, the appropriate Supervisory Board approvals have been obtained. The Internal Rules of the Supervisory Board contain detailed procedures for handling conflicts of interest on the part of Supervisory Board members.\n\n## Employee participation\n\nThe Group's Works Council holds regular meetings with the Executive Board in order to exchange information on developments affecting employees. Furthermore, the Group's Works Council has made use of its right to delegate members to the Supervisory Board (one employee representative for every two members elected by the Annual General Meeting). Therefore, out of the 15 Supervisory Board members, 5 members are employee representatives.\n\n## Rights of minority shareholders\n\n- \u25b8 Agenda items must be included at the request of shareholders holding not less than 5% of the shares.\n- \u25b8 General Meeting: An Extraordinary General Meeting must be convened at the request of shareholders holding not less than 5% of the shares.\n- \u25b8 Shareholders holding not less than 1% of the shares may submit resolution proposals on all agenda items. Such resolution proposals must be posted on the website upon request of the respective shareholders.\n- \u25b8 All shareholders, having duly provided evidence of their shareholding, are entitled to attend General Meetings, ask questions, and vote.\n- \u25b8 Shareholders holding not less than 10% of the shares may require an extraordinary audit in the event of grounds for suspicion of irregularities, or gross violations of the law or the Articles of Association.\n- \u25b8 Election of the Supervisory Board: If elections for two or more positions to the Supervisory Board are held at the same General Meeting, separate votes must be held for each position. If elections for three or more seats on the Supervisory Board are held at the same General Meeting, and if prior to the vote on the last position to be assigned it is found that at least one-third of all the votes have been cast in favor of the same person but he or she has not been elected, then this person must be declared as Supervisory Board member.\n\n## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 2022\n\nDiversity is an enormous strength that OMV actively leverages to create business value. OMV strongly believes that culturally diverse teams are more creative, resourceful, and knowledgeable, and that they generate broader perspectives, ideas, and options. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), therefore, have a strong impact on people and teams, improving engagement and job satisfaction, and directly contributing to the Group's profitability and sustainability.\n\nThe OMV Group is therefore expanding its DEI focus to include a broader range of diversity aspects, such as age, nationality, and special needs. Ultimately, the goal of OMV is to encourage and support all forms of diversity in the workforce and create an environment of respect where all employees are valued. This means having an inclusive culture in which the same opportunities and level of psychological safety are in place for all people to feel supported and be",

OMV is committed to supporting women's advancement to managerial positions. The aim is to increase the proportion of women in management roles from 21.6% 1 currently to 25% by 2025, and to 30% by 2030, through a number of initiatives such as mentoring, succession planning, specific training, and those that promote a healthy work-life balance.\n\nThe proportion of women in the Group as a whole is 27% (2021: 27%). A total of 21.6% 1 (2021: 20.9%) of employees in management and executive positions are female. In OMV's leadership development programs, the proportion of women was 49% in 2022 (2021: 49%). In OMV's Upstream integrated graduate development program for technical skill pools, the proportion of women was 21% in 2022 (2021: 31%). Diversity has been incorporated into all leadership development programs and embedded into the OMV People & Culture Strategy.\n\nIn 2022, a DEI Governance team was formed with representatives from OMV, OMV Petrom, and Borealis, and the new Group-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategy 2030 was launched. Group-wide work streams have been set up to give the actions of OMV in the areas of gender, generations, people with special needs, caregivers, and LGBTQI+ more momentum and visibility.\n\nOMV has also developed a Group-wide People & Culture Ethics Guideline, which gives more details on our clear position regarding non-discrimination in the workplace. In accordance with this guideline, OMV aims to put in place Group-wide complaints procedures and investigation principles for any misconduct in this regard.\n\nThroughout 2022, several events were organized to increase awareness of and ambition to focus on our DEI goals. In March, OMV hosted an International Women's Day and in October, the DEI Awareness Month featured several panel discussions and keynote speeches from the Executive Board and external experts.\n\nOMV further strengthened its training programs, such as SHEnergy, a blended learning program for women at OMV, to promote women's leadership skills. This program focuses on active inclusion skills and also emphasizes the power of mentoring and networking in developing female leaders.\n\nThe New Parent Program started in Austria, focusing on equipping future parents with information on parental leave and part-time models, associated long-term financial aspects, and things to consider when returning to work. The program's target group includes both male and female employees to encourage more equal distribution of childcare responsibilities.\n\nOMV promotes talents from different backgrounds, thus ensuring the best mix in diverse teams. OMV especially supports the recruitment and development of women in technical positions.\n\nOMV's headquarters in Vienna has two company kindergartens attended by children of OMV employees.\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board consider the described measures and programs for fostering the diversity of the workforce as a key factor in strengthening the diversity of the internal pool of Executive Board succession candidates. The Presidential and Nomination Committee concerns itself at least once a year with the identification and development of high-potential employees. In addition to internal succession planning, the Supervisory Board also makes use of external recruitments in order to best fill open Executive Board positions. When selecting Executive Board members - be it internally or externally - special attention is given to the balance of gender, age, and international experience, in addition to professional skills.\n\nUntil the resignation of Elena Skvortsova on October 31, 2022, there was one woman on the Executive Board of OMV. 2 At this point in time, the Executive Board members of OMV Aktiengesellschaft were between 52 and 60 years old, came from three different countries, and had acquired extensive international management experience.\n\nWith regard to the election of Supervisory Board members, the selection of potential candidates is based on various criteria, particularly the candidates' professional skills, personal integrity, independence, and impartial-",

In addition, diversity aspects such as the represen- tation of both genders, a balanced age distribution, in- dustry and technical expertise, and internationality of members is taken into consideration.\n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Supervisory Board of OMV included six women, corresponding to a share of 40%. In line with the strategic orientation of the Company, particular focus will be given to further strengthening in- dustry-specific expertise and the internationality of the Supervisory Board. With members aged between 42 and 70, the Supervisory Board's age structure is bal- anced.\n\n## External evaluation of Corporate Govern- ance\n\nAn external evaluation of OMV's compliance with the provisions of the ACCG is performed biennially. For the 2022 financial year, OMV engaged Deloitte Legal (Jank Weiler Operenyi Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH, attorney Jo- hannes Lutterotti). The official questionnaire of the Aus- trian Working Group for Corporate Governance was used for the evaluation, and the result was that OMV is in full compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance including all non-compulsory recommen- dations. The report on the evaluation is available for download on OMV's website (www.omv.com).\n\nVienna, March 9, 2023\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nAlfred Stern m.p.\n\nReinhard Florey m.p.\n\nMartijn van Koten m.p.\n\nDaniela Vlad m.p.\n\nVienna, March 9, 2023\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nAlfred Stern m.p.\n\nReinhard Florey m.p.\n\nMartijn van Koten m.p.\n\nBerislav Gaso m.p.\n\nDaniela Vlad m.p.",

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe considered the following matters as key audit matters for our audit:\n\n- 1. Deconsolidation and valuation of investments in Russia\n- 2. The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements\n- 3. Recoverability of equity-accounted investments\n- 4. Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets\n- 5. Estimation of oil and gas reserves\n- 6.

        "page_content": "## Key Audit Matter\n\n## Deconsolidation and valuation investments in Russia\n\nThe attack of Russia on Ukraine and countersanctions announced by Russia have significant impact on assets related to OMV's prior core region Russia.\n\nOMV is represented in Russia by an interest in the Yuzhno-Russkoye gas field. The gas is produced by the operator and the license holder, OJSC Severneftegazprom (SNGP), in which OMV holds 24.99% interest. The interest in SNGP was accounted for at equity until February 28, 2022. The gas is sold through the trading company JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development (YRGM), in which OMV holds one preferred share entitling OMV to a dividend of 99.99% of the total net profit. Up to February 28, 2022, YRGM was fully consolidated because all its activities were predetermined and OMV was fully exposed to the variability of returns. Due to the Russian countersanctions, which have an impact on the operation of foreign companies in Russia, OMV lost power to receive dividends from YRGM which led to the loss of control over YRGM and the loss of significant influence over SNGP.\n\nOMV has ceased to fully consolidate YRGM and to equity account for SNGP in the consolidated financial statements. Starting March 1, 2022, the investments in SNGP and YRGM are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss according to IFRS 9. This change led to a loss of EUR 658 mn.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments in YRGM and SNGP was further decreased to a book value of EUR 23 mn, leading to an additional loss of EUR 370 mn.\n\nThe remaining fair value of both investments has been estimated using a DCF model considering the production profile, expected gas prices and production costs, as well as an illiquidity discount.\n\nThe financial asset which is related to the reserves redetermination right out of the acquisition of the interest in the Yuzhno-Russkoye field in 2017 was fully written off with a fair value loss of EUR 432 mn.\n\nThe principal risk relates to management's assumption of losing control over YRGM and significant influence over SNGP, the recoverability of the remaining fair value of these two financial instruments as well as the valuation of the reserves redetermination right.\n\nOMV Group's disclosures about the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the related significant assumptions and estimates are included in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates).\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe assessed management's assumptions and estimates.\n\nSpecifically, our work included, but was not limited to, the following procedures:\n\n- \u25b8 Assess the criteria applied by OMV in determining the loss of control resp. significant influence over YRGM and SNGP;\n- \u25b8 Assess the design and implementation of controls related to estimating the key assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the investments and financial asset, such as estimated reserves and production profile, future gas prices and production costs;\n- \u25b8 Inquire OMV's executive board, legal department and gas trading management;\n- \u25b8 Evaluate OMV's assessment of production profile, future gas prices and production costs, as well as the illiquidity discount used for the fair value calculation with external data where available;\n- \u25b8 Involve our valuation specialists to assist us in the analysis of discount rates and inflation rates;\n- \u25b8 Assess OMV's gas reserves assumptions which led to a financial asset related to the reserves redetermination right and assess the subsequent write off;\n- \u25b8 Test the mathematical accuracy of fair value calculation;\n- \u25b8 Assess the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n- \u25b8 Reading of information in the director's report (strategy and OMV Group Business Year) and consider its consistency with the assumptions used by management; and",

The base case scenario considers that OECD countries will achieve the net zero emissions goal between 2050 and 2070 (equivalent to a path between the International Energy Agency (IEA) 'net zero emissions' (NZE) and 'sustainable development' (SDS) scenarios) and nonOECD countries will implement all announced decarbonization pledges in full and on time (equivalent to the IEA 'announced pledges scenario' (APS)).\n\nAs part of the sensitivity analysis over the recoverability of assets and valuation of decommissioning provisions, OMV performed a stress test analysis, using a decarbonization scenario which is built on a path between the IEA SDS and IEA NZE scenarios.\n\nAn additional sensitivity has been performed for assessing the recoverability of the oil and gas assets in the E&P segment using the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario which was modeled by the IEA and shows a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nOMV Group's disclosures about the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements, including sensitivities due to the stress test analysis, are included in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates).\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe evaluated management's key assumptions related to climate change and energy transition risks and how it impacted the critical accounting estimates and judgements on different areas of the financial statements.\n\nSpecifically, our work included, but was not limited to, the following procedures:\n\n- \u25b8 Assess the design and implementation of controls in the estimation processes, with a focus on how the impact of climate change and energy transition was considered for the key assumptions;\n- \u25b8 Reading of information in the director's report (strategy and sustainability) and consider its consistency with the assumptions used by management when preparing its energy transition base case scenario and stress test analysis;\n- \u25b8 Analyse with those responsible for group strategy and group reporting OMV's view on the impact of climate change and energy transition on key assumptions used in the base case scenario and stress test analysis;\n- \u25b8 Assessing OMV's mapping of the impact of climate change and energy transition risks into accounting estimates and judgements included in the financial statements;\n- \u25b8 Assess the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements regarding the impact of climate change and energy transition, including the sensitivities due to the stress test analysis and net zero emissions scenario analysis in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates).\n- \u25b8 Evaluate OMV's assessment of key assumptions (oil and gas price, CO2 price, refining and petrochemical margins and cracks, power prices and spreads, volume development) used in the base case comparing it to external market data and other resources where available; and",

The test of the recoverable amount performed by the management led to a reversal of previous impairment at the amount of EUR 67 mn.\n\nThe principal risk relates to management's estimates of future margin assumptions, production volumes, cash flows and discount rates, which are used to project the recoverability.\n\nOMV Group's disclosures about equity-accounted investments and the impairment testing related hereto are included in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates), Note 7 (Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups) and Note 16 (Equity-accounted investments).\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe assessed management's assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of equity-accounted investments by evaluating if and how management determines a need of impairment or reversing a previous impairment.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- \u25b8 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are in general based on the historical cost principle, except for certain items that have been measured at fair value as described in Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2022 have been prepared in million EUR (EUR mn, EUR 1,000,000). Accordingly, there may be rounding differences.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of OMV Aktiengesellschaft and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) as at December 31, 2022. The financial statements of all consolidated companies are prepared in accordance with uniform groupwide accounting policies. A list of subsidiaries, equityaccounted investments and other investments is included under Note 38 - Direct and indirect investments of OMV Aktiengesellschaft - including consolidation method, business segment, place of business and interest held by OMV.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2022 were approved and released for publication by the Supervisory Board on March 9, 2023.\n\n## 2 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n\n## 1) Significant judgements and estimates\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, income and expenses, as well as the amounts disclosed in the notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are deemed reasonable at the date of preparation of these financial statements. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions were required in particular with regards to the effects from the climate crisis and energy transition as well as the Ukraine-Russia-crisis. These estimates and assumptions are described below in section a) and b).\n\nIn addition, estimates and assumptions with significant impact on OMV Group result were made with respect to oil and gas reserves, the recoverability of assets,\n\nprovisions, lease contracts, and taxes on income. These are described together with the relevant accounting policies in section 2 of this note and highlighted in grey.\n\n## a) Significant estimates and assumptions in assessing climate-related risks\n\nOMV has considered the short- and long-term effects of climate change and energy transition in preparing the consolidated financial statements. They are subject to uncertainty and they may have significant impacts on the assets and liabilities currently reported by the Group.\n\nIn 2022, OMV defined the first time concrete short-, medium-, and long-term targets for its emissions reductions and committed to becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2, and 3).

        "page_content": "2040. For Scope 3 emissions, OMV is striving for a reduction of at least 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2040. 1\n\nThe significant accounting estimates performed by management incorporate the future effects of OMV's own strategic decisions and commitments on having its portfolio adhered to the energy transition targets, short and long-term impacts of climate risks and energy transition to lower carbon energy sources together with management's best estimate on global supply and demand, including forecasted commodities prices.\n\nNevertheless, there is significant uncertainty around the changes in the mix of energy sources over the next 30 years and the extent to which such changes will meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. While companies can commit to such ambitions, financial reporting under IFRS requires the use of assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of expected future economic conditions, which may differ from such targets. These assumptions include expectations about future worldwide decarbonization efforts and the transition of economies to net zero emissions.\n\nOMV uses two different scenarios which were developed by the internal Market Intelligence department: the base case and the stress case. The scenarios differ in the underlying expectations about the pace of the future worldwide decarbonization and lead to different assumptions for demand, prices and margins of fossil commodities. The base case is used for the mid-term planning as well as for estimates going into the measurement of various items in the group financial statements, including impairment testing of non-financial assets and the measurement of provisions. The stress case which is based on a faster decarbonization path than the base case is used for calculating sensitivities in order to recognize the uncertainty in the pace of the energy transition and to better understand the financial risk from energy transition on the existing assets of OMV. Both scenarios, the base and stress case, reflect more climate change mitigation efforts and a faster decarbonization path than the scenarios used in the prior year. But OMV still expects to see energy transition at different paces in different parts of the world.\n\nThe base case is built on a scenario in which OECD countries will achieve the net zero emissions goal between 2050 and 2070 (equivalent to a path between the IEA 'net zero emissions' (NZE) and 'sustainable development' (SDS) scenarios) and non-OECD countries will implement all announced decarbonization pledges in full and on time (equivalent to the IEA 'announced pledges scenario' (APS)). 2\n\nFor the stress test analysis, a decarbonization scenario is used which is a potential trajectory to reaching the climate goals according to the Paris Agreement. In this scenario, it is assumed that advanced economies will reach the net zero emissions goal by 2050, while middle-income and developing economies will only follow at a later point but not later than 2070. This scenario is built on a path between the IEA SDS and IEA NZE scenarios. The entire world following the commitments of the Paris Agreement leads to lower global demand for oil and gas and consequently to lower oil and gas prices than in the base case. In addition, this scenario incorporates other possible effects such as slower economic growth in the short term.\n\nIn an additional sensitivity analysis for assessing the recoverability of the oil and gas assets in the E&P segment, OMV used the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario which was modeled by the IEA. 3 It shows a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nFor investment decisions, business cases are calculated based on the same price and demand assumptions as are used for the mid-term planning and impairment tests. In addition, a business case calculation based on the stress case assumptions is mandatory for all investment decisions in order to assess the economic viability under a 'Paris aligned' scenario. The IEA NZE scenario is not used for investment decisions.\n\nCosts for CO2 emissions are taken into account in business case calculations, impairment tests as well as the stress case scenario calculations to the extent carbon pricing schemes are in place in the respective countries. Estimates for the CO2 prices in the European Union are disclosed in Note 2.2j.",

        "page_content": "## Recoverability of assets\n\nCommodity price assumptions have a significant impact on the recoverable amounts of E&A assets, PPE and goodwill. For the impairment tests, the price set as defined for the mid-term planning and incorporating the energy transition scenario as described above was used. Disclosures on the impairment tests - including the detailed price set - are included in Note 2.2j as well as Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups. The outcome of the impairment tests is not in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe sensitivities calculated based on the stress case indicate that there is mainly a risk for impairments in a Paris-aligned scenario for oil and gas assets in the E&P\n\nsegment. In order to further assess the risk from different decarbonization scenarios and its impact on OMV's oil and gas assets, an additional calculation of a possible effect of using the oil and gas prices in a 1.5\u00b0C compatible Net Zero Emission by 2050 (NZE) scenario by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been performed. CO2 price assumptions were the same as in the stress case calculation. They are in line with the IEA NZE scenario for the European Union. But no CO2 prices were taken into account in countries without CO2 pricing systems in place.\n\nThe impact of the OMV stress case and the 'NZE by 2050' calculation on the carrying amounts of oil and gas assets are summarized in the table below.\n\n## Sensitivities on oil and gas assets 1\n\n|                          | Decrease of car- rying amounts of  oil and gas assets  in EUR bn   |   Remaining carry- ing amounts of oil  and gas assets  in EUR bn | Brent oil price in  real terms  2030/2040/2050 2 USD/bbl   | Gas price THE in  real terms  2030/2040/2050 2 EUR/MWh   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| OMV stress case scenario | (5.3)                                                              |                                                              6.9 | 47/27/20                                                   | 18/18/18                                                 |\n| IEA NZE scenario         | (6.1)                                                              |                                                              6   | 36/30/25                                                   | 15/13/12                                                 |\n\n- 1 Including oil and gas assets with unproved and proved reserves, E&P at-equity investments and E&P related goodwill\n- 2 In 2027 real terms\n\nWhereas the recoverability of the refineries in the R&M segment would also be impacted through globally declining demand for almost all products, resulting in lower margins and cracks in a scenario assuming a quicker decarbonization path, the carrying amounts of assets in the C&M segment are not expected to be at risk.\n\nMore details on the stress tests including a description of the assumptions applied are included in Note 2.2j.\n\n## Useful lives\n\nThe pace of energy transition may have an impact on the remaining useful lives of assets.The depreciable fixed assets in the refineries will in average be fully depreciated over the next 9 years and in retail over the next 5 to 10 years. Demand for petroleum products is expected to stay robust over this period of time. It is therefore not expected that energy transition has a material impact on the expected useful lives of property, plant, and equipment in the R&M segment.\n\nIn the E&P segment, oil and gas assets are depreciated using the unit-of-production method as described\n\nin Note 2.2h which is based on proved reserves. According to the current production plans, 31% of proved reserves as at December 31, 2022, will be left by 2030, 5% by 2040, and less than 1% by 2050. The existing oil and gas assets with proved reserves will therefore be significantly depreciated until 2030 and, with the exception of one field, fully depreciated until 2050.\n\nAs OMV doesn't see the C&M segment materially impacted by the energy transition, there is also no material impact on useful lives in this segment expected.\n\n## Decommissioning provisions\n\nThe maturity profile of decommissioning provisions is included in Note 23 - Provisions. The economic cut-off date of oil and gas assets does not shift significantly under the stress case scenario. The impact on the carrying amount of the decommissioning provisions is therefore expected to be immaterial.\n\nFor refineries, no decommissioning provisions are recognized. OMV's refinery sites are expected to continue to be used for production under a Paris-aligned energy transition scenario. There are significant investments planned in the next years with the goal to adapt OMV's",

Furthermore, ADNOC Refining is expected to continue to operate under such a scenario because of its favourable positioning in the market.\n\n## b) Impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related significant estimates and assumptions\n\nThe attack of Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, led to developments that had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOMV is represented in Russia by an interest in the Yuzhno-Russkoye gas field. The gas is produced by the operator and the license holder, OJSC Severneftegazprom (SNGP), in which OMV holds a 24.99% interest. The interest in SNGP was until February 28, 2022, accounted for at equity. The gas is sold through the trading company JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development (YRGM), in which OMV holds one preferred share entitling OMV to a dividend of 99.99% of the total net profit. Until February 2022, YRGM was fully consolidated because all its activities are predetermined and OMV was fully exposed to the variability of returns. In response to the sanctions of the Western countries, Russia passed several countersanctions, which have an impact on the operation of foreign companies in Russia. According to these countersanctions, among others, OMV lost power to receive dividends from YRGM, which led to the loss of control over YRGM and the loss of significant influence over SNGP. For this reason, OMV ceased to fully consolidate YRGM and to equity account for SNGP in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nStarting March 1, 2022, the investments in SNGP and YRGM are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss according to IFRS 9. The deconsolidation led to a loss of EUR 658 mn; of that amount, EUR 399 mn was related to the recycling of the cumulative currency differences originally recognized in other comprehensive income. The total amount was included in other operating expenses. In addition, the deconsolidation had a negative impact on the cash flow from investing activities in the amount of EUR 208 mn due to the derecognized cash balance of YRGM, shown in the line 'Cash disposed due to the loss of control.' As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments in YRGM and SNGP was further decreased to a book value of EUR 23 mn, leading to an additional loss of EUR 370 mn in the financial result. The fair value measurement takes into account the further deterioration of the political and legal environment in Russia and is based on a DCF model considering the production profile, expected gas prices, and production costs, as well as an\n\nilliquidity discount of 90% on the remaining net present value of the cash flows and the cash balance.\n\nOMV has a contractual position toward Gazprom from the redetermination of the reserves of the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field, which was taken over as part of the acquisition of the participation in this field in 2017. According to this agreement, the volume of gas reserves in the Yuzhno Russkoye field is contractually defined and, in case the reserves are higher or lower than what was assumed in the agreement, either OMV could be obligated to compensate Gazprom (but would have profited in the future from higher sales volumes) or Gazprom could be obligated to compensate OMV. The payment for the reserve redetermination is linked to the actual amount of the gas reserves.\n\nA fair value calculation which was based on three different scenarios, one of them based on an internal estimate by OMV, led to a positive value. In the current difficult political and legal environment in Russia, OMV, however, no longer expects this contractual position to be recoverable. As a consequence, a fair value loss of EUR 432 mn was recognized in other operating expenses, which reduced the fair value of this position to zero.\n\nIn 2021, the fair value measurement was based on OMV's internal reserve estimates and led to an asset with a value of EUR 432 mn. An external assessment of the reserves in Yushno Russkoye as of December 31, 2020, showed a signficant deviation from the internal estimate. In an additional expert-opinion by an independent, external expert OMV's approach for determining the reserves was, however, deemed appropriate. An increase of the estimated reserves over the contractually defined reserves could lead to a financial liability toward Gazprom.\n\nThe total payments made by OMV as financial investor under the financing agreements for Nord Stream 2 amounted to EUR 729 mn. The total outstanding amount including accrued interest as of March 5, 2022, amounted to EUR 1 bn and was fully impaired, negatively impacting the financial result (carrying amount as of December 31, 2021: EUR 987 mn).\n\nWhereas OMV purchased on average 7.6 TWh per month of natural gas under long-term supply agreements with Gazprom in Austria and Germany in the first quarter of 2022, there were curtailments of gas delivery volumes since mid of June and no deliveries to Germany since end of August 2022. In the second half of 2022, OMV imported on average 2.6 TWh per month of natural gas based on these contracts. The curtailments",

        "page_content": "of gas delivery volumes required adjustments to OMV's hedging ratios and replacement purchases on the market resulting in a negative financial impact. The uncertainty regarding future curtailments and delivery volumes remains and could result in further substantial losses in particular, in case actual deliveries materially deviate from previously hedged volumes leading to partially unmitigated gas price exposure from Gazprom supply contracts.\n\nNo onerous contract provisions have been recognized for the long-term gas supply contracts with Gazprom. The pricing of these contracts is based on current hub prices and it is not possible to estimate any negative impact from future gas curtailments. The hedges related to the supply from these contracts are measured at fair value and not subject to hedge accounting.\n\nOMV took various measures to replace Russian gas supplies and to ensure that it can meet all of its supply obligations. This included the establishment of routes for deliveries from North Western Europe (e.g. Norwegian equity gas and liquified natural gas (LNG) supply via the Gate terminal) and Italy. In July, OMV managed to secure 40 TWh of additional transport capacities to Austria for the current gas year (October 1, 2022 September 30, 2023) at the transfer points Oberkappel (pipeline from Germany) and Arnoldstein (pipeline from Italy). Furthermore, storages have been filled to maximize possible withdrawals in case of supply cuts and OMV has access to liquid gas market hubs in Europe, if needed.\n\nAs a direct consequence of the energy crisis in Europe, regulatory measures like the EU solidarity contribution and price caps were implemented in some of the countries in which OMV is active. The impact from the EU solidarity contribution on the group financial statements is disclosed in Note 12 - Taxes on income and profit.\n\n## 2) Significant accounting policies\n\n## a) Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired are included at their fair value at the time of acquisition. For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration classified as financial asset or liability is subsequently measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for non-controlling interest and the fair value of the equity previously held by OMV in the acquired entity over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is recorded as an asset and tested for impairment at least yearly. Impairments are recorded immediately through profit or loss, subsequent writeups are not possible. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\n## b) Sales revenue\n\nRevenue is generally recognized when control over a product or a service is transferred to a customer. It is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\nWhen goods such as crude oil, LNG, oil and chemical products and similar goods are sold, the delivery of each quantity unit normally represents a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer, which is the point in time when legal ownership as well as the risk of loss has passed to the customer and is determined on the basis of the Incoterm agreed in the contract with the customer. These sales are done with normal credit terms according to the industry standard.\n\nRevenue from the production of crude oil, in which OMV has an interest with other producers, is recognized according to the sales method. This means that revenue is recognized based on the actual sales to third parties, regardless of the Group's percentage interest or entitlement. An adjustment of production costs is recognized at average cost for the difference between the costs associated with the output sold and the costs incurred based on entitlement to output, with a counter entry in the other assets or liabilities.\n\nIn the R&M retail business, revenues from the sale of fuels are recognized when products are supplied to the customers. Depending on whether OMV is principal or agent in the sale of shop merchandise, revenue and costs related to such sales are presented gross or net in the income statement. OMV is principal if it controls the goods before they are transferred to the customer, which is mainly indicated by OMV having the inventory risk. At filling stations, payments are due immediately at the time of purchase.\n\nOMV's gas and power supply contracts include a single performance obligation which is satisfied over the agreed delivery period. Revenue is recognized according to the consumption by the customer and in",

        "page_content": "line with the amount to which OMV has a right to invoice. Only in exceptional cases long-term gas supply contracts contain stepped prices in different periods where the rates do not reflect the value of the goods at the time of delivery. In these cases revenue is recognized based on the average contractual price.\n\nIn some customer contracts for the delivery of natural gas, the fees charged to the customer comprise a fixed charge as well as a variable fee depending on the volumes delivered. These contracts contain only one performance obligation which is to stand-ready for the delivery of gas over a certain period. The revenue from the fixed charges and the variable fees is recognized in line with the amount chargeable to the customer. Gas and power deliveries are billed and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nGas storage contracts contain a stand-ready obligation for providing storage services over an agreed period of time. Revenue is recognized according to the amount to which OMV has a right to invoice. These services are billed and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nThere are some customer contracts in OMV for the delivery of oil and gas as well as for the provision of gas storage services which have a term of more than one year. In principle, IFRS 15 requires the disclosure of the total amount of transaction prices allocated to unperformed performance obligations for such contracts. Contracts for the delivery of oil contain variable prices based on market prices as at delivery date, as it is common in the oil industry. For these contracts it is, therefore, not possible to allocate the transaction price to unsatisfied performance obligations. For gas delivery and gas storage contracts OMV applies the practical expedient according to IFRS 15.121 (b) according to which this information need not be disclosed for contracts where revenue is recognized in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. OMV, therefore, does not disclose this information.\n\n## c) Other revenues\n\nOther revenues include revenues from commodity contracts which are in the scope of IFRS 9. Sales and purchases of commodities are reported net within other revenues, when the forward sales and purchase contracts are determined to be for trading purposes and not for the final physical delivery.\n\nIn addition, other revenues include an adjustment of revenues from considering the national oil company's profit share as income tax in certain production sharing agreements in the E&P segment (see 2.2f), realized\n\nand unrealized results from hedging of sales transactions as well as lease and rental income.\n\n## d) Exploration expenses\n\nExploration expenses relate exclusively to the business segment E&P and comprise the costs associated with unproved reserves. These include geological and geophysical costs for the identification and investigation of areas with possible oil and gas reserves and administrative, legal and consulting costs in connection with exploration. They also include all impairments on exploration wells where no proved reserves could be demonstrated. Depreciation of economically successful exploration wells is reported as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and write-ups.\n\n## e) Research and development\n\nExpenditure related to research activities is recognized as expense in the period in which it is incurred. Research and development (R&D) expenses, which are presented in the income statement within the lineOther operating expenses, include all direct and indirect materials, personnel and external services costs incurred in connection with the focused search for new insights related to the development and significant improvement of products, services and processes and in connection with research activities. Development costs are capitalized if the recognition criteria according to IAS 38 are fulfilled.\n\n## f) Exploration and production sharing agreements\n\nExploration and production sharing agreements (EPSAs) are contracts for oil and gas licenses in which the oil or gas production is shared between one or more oil companies and the host country/national oil company in defined proportions. Exploration expenditures are carried by the oil companies as a rule and recovered from the state or the national oil company through so called 'cost oil' in a successful case only. Under certain EPSA contracts the host country's/national oil company's profit share represents imposed income taxes and is treated as such for purposes of the income statement presentation.\n\n## g) Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized at costs of acquisition or construction (including costs of major inspection and general overhauls). The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset when a decommissioning provision is recognized (see 2.2s). Costs for replacements of components are capitalized and carrying values of the replaced parts are derecognized. Costs",

The acquisition costs of geological and geophysical studies before the discovery of proved reserves, are recognized in the period in which they are incurred. The costs of wells are capitalized and reported as intangible assets until the existence or absence of potentially commercially viable oil or gas reserves is determined. Wells which are not commercially viable are expensed. The costs of exploration wells whose commercial viability has not yet been determined continue to be capitalized as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u25b8 Sufficient oil and gas reserves have been discovered that would justify completion as a production well.\n- \u25b8 The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has not expired.\n- \u25b8 Sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and technical feasibility to justify beginning field development in the near future.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Recoverability of unproved oil and gas assets\n\nThere may be cases when costs related to unproved oil and gas properties remain capitalized over longer periods while various appraisal and seismic activities\n\ncontinue in order to assess the size of the reservoir and its commerciality. Further decisions on the optimum timing of such developments are made from a resource and portfolio point of view. As soon as there is no further intention to develop a discovery, the assets are immediately impaired.\n\nExploratory wells in progress at year-end which are determined to be unsuccessful subsequent to the statement of financial position date are treated as non-adjusting events, meaning that the costs incurred for such exploratory wells remain capitalized in the financial statements of the reporting period under review and will be expensed in the subsequent period.\n\nLicense acquisition costs and capitalized exploration and appraisal activities are not amortized as long as they are related to unproved reserves, but tested for impairment when there is an indicator for a potential impairment. Once the reserves are proved and commercial viability is established, the related assets are reclassified into tangible assets. Development expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms and pipelines and drilling development wells is capitalized within tangible assets. Once production starts, depreciation commences. Capitalized exploration and development costs and support equipment are generally depreciated\n\nIntangible assets and depreciable property, plant and equipment (except for oil and gas assets, see 2.2h) are amortized or depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life.",

In addition, external reviews are performed regularly. In 2022, the reserves of the oil and gas assets (as of December 31, 2021) in Tunisia, KRI and Malaysia were externally reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M). The reserves of the other significant oil and gas assets were externally reviewed the year before.\n\nThe results of the external reviews did not show significant deviations from the internal estimates, apart from few exceptional cases. In case of significant deviations, OMV performs further analysis, involving additional independent experts, where necessary.\n\nOil and gas reserve estimates have a significant impact on the assessment of the recoverability of carrying amounts of the Group's oil and gas assets. Downward revisions of these estimates could lead to impairment of the asset's carrying. In addition, changes to the estimates of oil and gas reserves impact prospectively the amount of amortization and depreciation.\n\n## i) Associated companies and joint arrangements\n\nAssociated companies are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies. Joint arrangements, which are arrangements of which the Group has joint control together with one or more parties, are classified into joint ventures or joint operations. Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the parties that share control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint operations are joint arrangements in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of the profit or loss less dividends received and the Group's\n\nshare of other comprehensive income and other movements in equity.\n\nSignificant joint exploration and production activities in the E&P segment are conducted through joint operations which are not structured through a separate vehicle. For these joint operations, OMV recognizes in the consolidated financial statements its share of the assets held and liabilities and expenses incurred jointly with the other partners, as well as the group's income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation. Acquisitions of interests in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, are accounted for according to the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combination accounting (see 2.2a).\n\nIn addition, there are contractual arrangements similar to joint operations which are not jointly controlled and therefore do not meet the definition of a joint operation according to IFRS 11. This is the case when the main decisions can be taken by more than one combination of affirmative votes of the involved parties or where one other party has control. OMV assesses whether such arrangements are within or out of scope of IFRS 11 on the basis of the relevant legal arrangements such as concession, license or joint operating agreements which define how and by whom the relevant decisions for these activities are taken. The accounting treatment for these arrangements is basically the same as for joint operations. As acquisitions of interests in such arrangements are not within the scope of IFRS 3, OMV's accounting policy is to treat such transactions as asset acquisitions.\n\n## j) Impairment of assets\n\nIntangible assets, property, plant and equipment (including oil and gas assets) as well as investments in associated companies and joint ventures are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Impairment tests are performed on the level of the asset or the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nIf assets are determined to be impaired, the carrying amounts are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a",

        "page_content": "post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. The pre-tax discount rate is determined by way of iteration. The cash flows are generally derived from the recent budgets and planning calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal is determined on the basis of the recent market transactions, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\nIf the reasons for impairment no longer apply in a subsequent period, a reversal is recognized in profit or loss. The increased carrying amount related to the reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization and depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Recoverability of assets\n\nEvaluating whether assets or CGUs are impaired or whether past impairments should be reversed, require the use of various estimates and assumptions such as price and margin developments, production volumes and discount rates.\n\nChanges in the economic situation, expectations about climate-related risks or other facts and circumstances might require a revision of these assumptions and could lead to impairments of assets or reversals of impairments within the next financial year.\n\n## 2022 Price assumptions for impairment testing\n\nBrent oil price (USD/bbl) EUR-USD exchange rate Brent oil price (EUR/bbl) Gas price THE (EUR/MWh) CO2 price EUA (EUR/t)\n\n|   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |   2027 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|   80   |   75   |   70   |   65   |   65   |   65   |   60   |   60   |\n|    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |    1.1 |\n|   73   |   68   |   64   |   59   |   59   |   59   |   55   |   55   |\n|   91   |   64   |   46   |   36   |   27   |   24   |   24   |   24   |\n|   85   |   92   |  100   |  107   |  114   |  129   |  142   |  118   |\n\n## Significant assumptions\n\nThe price and margin assumptions used in impairment testing are reviewed annually by management and approved by the Supervisory Board within the mid-term planning (MTP). They are based on management's best estimate and were consistent with external sources. Whereas prices in the near term are anchored in recent forward prices and market developments, long-term price assumptions are developed using a variety of long-term forcasts by reputable experts and consultants and consider longterm views of global supply and demand. OMV's long-term assumptions take into consideration the impacts of the climate change and the energy transition to lower-carbon energy sources (see section 1 of this note).\n\nDuring the reporting period, OMV increased its nearterm assumptions for Brent oil taking into account the tighter post-COVID-19 market. The long-term oil prices were kept on the same level as in the prior year. European gas prices were increased significantly in the near term after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sharp decline of Russian gas flows into the European market. In the long term, European gas prices are assumed to stay slightly above the assumptions of 2021 also due to lower supply of Russian gas to Europe and despite a faster decarbonization assumed than in 2021.\n\nThe price assumptions as well as the EUR-USD exchange rates are listed below (in nominal terms in the first 5 years and afterwards in 2027 real terms in 2022 and 2026 real terms in 2021):",

The production profiles were estimated based on reserves estimates (see Note 2.2h) and past experience and represent management's best estimate of future production. The cash flow projections for the first five years are based on the mid-term plan and thereafter on a 'life of field' planning and therefore cover the whole life term of the field.\n\nThe increase in gas prices was considered as an indication for reversal of impairments of European gas assets which were recognized in prior years. On the contrary, the expected production volume of some oil and gas fields in Romania decreased due to higher expected natural decline rates and the cost base increased. The results of the impairment tests are disclosed in Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups.\n\nIn the R&M and C&M business, the main assumptions for the calculation of the recoverable amounts are the relevant margins, volumes as well as discount, inflation and growth rates. The value in use calculation is based on the cash flows of the 5year mid-term planning and a terminal value.\n\n## 2022 Price assumptions for stress case sensitivities\n\nBrent oil price (USD/bbl) EUR-USD exchange rate Brent oil price (EUR/bbl) Gas price THE (EUR/MWh) CO2 price EUA (EUR/t)\n\n|   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |   2027 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|   65   |   60   |   55   |   50   |   50   |   47   |   27   |   20   |\n|    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |    1.2 |\n|   54   |   50   |   46   |   42   |   42   |   39   |   23   |   17   |\n|   69   |   48   |   35   |   27   |   20   |   18   |   18   |   18   |\n|  100   |  107   |  114   |  121   |  129   |  142   |  194   |  232   |\n\nThe stress case sensitivities were calculated using a simplified method. The calculation was based on a DCF model similar to a value in use calculation where no future investments for enhancements and improvements  were considered. The calculations do not consider consequential measures that management could implement such as  divestments and\n\nchanges in business plans. The amounts presented should therefore not be seen as a best estimate of an expected impairment impact following such a scenario.\n\nIn the E&P segment, the cash flows are based on an adjusted mid-term planning for five years and a life of\n\nAs far as refining margins in the Middle East are concerned, they were assumed to increase in the near term but to stay in the long run on the same level as in the previous period. The margin improvement in the near term was considered as an indication for reversal of the impairment recognized on the ADNOC Refining investment in 2021. The growth rate included in the terminal value calculation was assumed as 1%.\n\n## Sensitivities based on stress case\n\nSensitivities based on a stress case scenario have been calculated to test the resilience of assets against risks from a slower economic growth and the Russia-Ukraine crisis in the near term and from climate-related risks in the longer term. Long-term price and margin assumptions are based on a Parisaligned scenario with a worldwide transition to net zero emissions between 2050 and 2070 (for more details see section 1 of this note).\n\nThe assumptions used in the sensitivity analysis are included in the table below (prices in nominal terms in the first 5 years and afterwards in 2027 real terms):",

        "page_content": "field planning for the remaining years until abandonment. The stress case does not include any other changes to input factors than prices and volumes and does not consider any restructuring measures.\n\nUnder this stress test scenario, the carrying amounts of the oil and gas assets with proved reserves (incl. E&P at-equity investments) would have to be decreased by EUR 4.4 bn and goodwill would decrease by EUR 0.6 bn. In addition, some oil and gas assets with unproved reserves would be abandoned with a pre-tax P&L impact of EUR 0.3 bn. For E&P oil and gas assets, an additional sensitivity based on oil and gas prices according to the IEA Net Zero by 2050 scenario was calculated and showed a decrease in the carrying amount of oil and gas assets with proved and unproved reserves (incl. E&P goodwill) of EUR 6.1 bn (see section 1 of this note).\n\nIn the R&M segment, the stress case reflects globally declining demand for almost all products resulting in lower margins and cracks compared to the impairment test scenario. Under the stress case scenario, the carrying amounts related to refineries (including the investment in ADNOC Refining) would have to be decreased by in total EUR 0.6 bn, mainly related to ADNOC Refining investment and Petrobrazi in Romania. The Schwechat and Burghausen refineries are more resilient against impairment risks in such a scenario due to the strong focus of these refineries on petrochemical production.\n\nIn the stress test calculations for the refineries,  the cash flows of the 5-year mid-term planning were adjusted for the lower margins. The refining indicator margins Europe were assumed to be lower by approximately 50% in the stress case than in the mid-term planning. The terminal value for the refineries in Europe was calculated based on the cash flows derived from the last detailed planning period and a growth rate which is equivalent to the CAGR derived from a long-term estimate of margins and sales volumes. The growth rates are in the range between (3.17)% and 1.0%. In addition, cash flows assumed for the terminal value incorporate a significant decrease in operating costs and CAPEX.\n\n## k) Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts are to be realized by sale rather than through continued use. This is the case when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Non-current assets and disposal\n\ngroups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are no longer amortized or depreciated.\n\n## l) Leases\n\nOMV as a lessee recognizes lease liabilities and rightof-use assets for lease contracts according to IFRS 16. It applies the recognition exemption for short-term leases and leases in which the underlying asset is of low value and therefore does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for such leases. Leases to explore for and use oil and natural gas, which comprise mainly land leases used for such activities, are not in the scope of IFRS 16. The rent for these contracts is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNon-lease components are separated from the lease components for the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of fixed lease payments and lease payments which depend on an index or rate over the determined lease term with the applicable discount rate. Right-of-use assets are recognized at the value of the lease liability plus prepayments and initial direct costs and presented within property, plant and equipment.\n\nOMV as a lessor entered into contracts which were assessed as operating leases, for which fixed and variable rent is recognized as revenue from rents and leases over the period of the lease.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Leases\n\nOMV has a significant number of contracts in which it leases filling stations. Many of those contracts include prolongation and termination options. Prolongation options or periods after termination options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the lease is prolonged or not terminated. When determining the lease term the Group takes into account all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for shortening or prolonging the lease term using the available options. When assessing the lease term of leases in filling stations for periods covered by prolongation or termination options, the assumption was applied that the lease term will not exceed 20 years.\n\nOptional periods, which have not been taken into account in the measurement of the leases, exist mainly for E&P equipment in Romania, office buildings, a",

The prolongation option for the office buildings and the gas storage caverns can only be exercised in the distant future.\n\n## m) Non-derivative financial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, OMV classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends both on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets as well as  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. All regular way trades are recognized and derecognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25b8 the asset is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u25b8 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Interest income, impairment losses and gains or losses on derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOMV recognizes allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all financial assets measured at amortized costs. The ECL calculation is based on external or internal credit ratings of the counterparty and associated probabilities of default. Available forward-looking information is taken into account, if it has a material impact on the amount of valuation allowance recognized.\n\nECLs are recognized in two stages. Where there has not been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, credit losses are measured at 12 month ECLs. The 12 month ECL is the credit loss which results from default events that are possible within the next 12 months. The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the definition of 'investment grade'.\n\nWhere there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is\n\nrequired for the lifetime ECL, i.e. the expected credit losses resulting from possible default events over the expected life of a financial asset. For this assessment, OMV considers all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. Furthermore, OMV assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has significantly increased if it is more than 30 days past due. If the credit quality improves for a lifetime ECL asset, OMV reverts to recognizing allowances on a 12 month ECL basis. A financial asset is considered to be in default when the financial asset is 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supportable information  demonstrating that a more lagging default criterion is appropriate. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation that the contractual cash flows will be recovered.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets from contracts with customers a simplified approach is adopted, where the impairment losses are recognized at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. In case there are credit insurances or securities held against the balances outstanding, the ECL calculation is based on the probability of default of the insurer/securer for the insured/secured element of the outstanding balance and for the remaining amount on the probability of default of the counterparty.\n\nNon-derivative financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) include trade receivables from sales contracts with provisional pricing and investment funds because the contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Furthermore, this measurement category includes portfolios of trade receivables held with an intention to sell them. These assets are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments are either measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) . OMV decided irrevocably to classify as investments at FVOCI the majority of its non-listed equity investments which are held for strategic purposes and not trading. Gains and losses on equity investments measured at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss and they are not subject to impairment assessment. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss unless they represent a recovery of a part of the cost of an investment.\n\nOMV derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all",

The assessment process is considering inter alia the history of amounts claimed, documentation process related requirements, potential litigation or arbitration proceedings.\n\nDetails on the valuation of the investments measured at fair value through profit or loss in the gas field Yuzhno Russkoye and the contractual position towards Gazprom with regard to the reserve redetermination can be found in section 1 of this note.\n\n## n) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to hedge risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as income or expense, except where hedge accounting according to IFRS 9 is applied.\n\nThose derivatives qualifying and designated as hedges are either\n\n- \u25b8 a fair value hedge when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability,\n- \u25b8 a net investment hedge when hedging the foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation.\n- \u25b8 a cash flow hedge when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, or\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the effective part of the changes in fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective part is recognized immediately in the income statement. Where the hedging of cash flows results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the carrying value of that item will be adjusted for the accumulated gains or losses recognized directly in OCI.\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the reserve for currency translation differences. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of or sold.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to hedges which are affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. For the purpose of evaluating whether there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments, the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nContracts to buy or sell non-financial items that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument are accounted for as financial instruments and measured at fair value. Associated gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss. However, contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of non-financial items in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but as executory contracts.\n\n## o) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualified assets are capitalized until these assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other costs of borrowing are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## p) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized as income or deducted from the carrying amount of the related assets, where it is reasonable to expect that the granting conditions will be met and that the grants will be received.\n\n## q) Inventories\n\nInventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs incurred are generally determined based on the individual costs for not interchangeable goods, the average price method for oil and gas inventories or the FIFO method for chemical products. Costs of production comprise directly attributable costs as well as fixed and variable indirect material and production overhead costs. Production-related administrative costs, the costs of company pension schemes and voluntary employee benefits are also included in the cost of production. In refineries, a carrying capacity approach is applied according to which the",

        "page_content": "production costs are allocated to product groups on the basis of their relative market values at the end of the period.\n\n## r) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, bank accounts and highly liquid short-term investments with low realization risk, i.e. negligible short-term exchange and interest risks. The maximum maturity at the time of acquisition for such investments is three months.\n\n## s) Provisions\n\nA provision is recorded for present obligations against third parties when it is probable that an obligation will occur and the settlement amount can be estimated reliably. Provisions for individual obligations are based on the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle the obligation, discounted to the present value in the case of long-term obligations.\n\n## Decommissioning and environmental obligations :\n\nThe Group's core activities regularly lead to obligations related to dismantling and removal, asset retirement and soil remediation activities. These decommissioning and restoration obligations are principally of material importance in the E&P segment (oil and gas wells, surface facilities) and in connection with filling stations on third-party property. At the time the obligation arises, it is provided for in full by recognizing the present value of future decommissioning and restoration expenses as a liability. An equivalent amount is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of long-lived assets. Any such obligation is calculated on the basis of best estimates. The unwinding of discounting leads to interest expense or income (in case of a negative discount rate) and accordingly to increased or decreased obligations at each statement of financial position date until decommissioning or restoration. For other environmental risks and measures, provisions are recognized if such obligations are probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Decommissioning provisions\n\nThe most significant decommissioning obligations of the Group are related to the plugging of wells, the abandonment of facilities and the removal and disposal of offshore installations. The majority of these activities are planned to occur many years into the future, while decommissioning technologies, costs, regulations and public expectations are constantly changing. Estimates of future restoration costs are based on reports prepared by Group engineers or\n\nby partner companies and on past experience. Any significant downward changes in the expected future costs or postponement in the future affect both the provision and the related asset, to the extent that there is sufficient carrying amount. Otherwise the provision is reversed to income. Significant upward revisions trigger the assessment of the recoverability of the underlying asset.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning and restoration costs require estimates of discount and inflation rates, which have material effects on the amounts of the provision. The assumptions used are disclosed in Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nPensions and similar obligations : OMV has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. In the case of defined contribution plans , OMV has no obligations beyond payment of the agreed premiums, and no provision is therefore recognized. The reported expense corresponds to the contributions payable for the period.\n\nIn contrast, participants in defined benefit plans are entitled to pensions at certain levels and are generally based on years of service and the employee's average compensation. These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk (as a result of indexation of pension) and market risk. Defined benefit pension obligations are accounted for by recognizing provisions for pensions.\n\nEmployees of Austrian Group companies whose service began before December 31, 2002 are entitled to severance payments upon termination of employment or upon reaching the normal retirement age. The entitlements depend on years of service and final compensation levels. Entitlements to severance payments for employees whose service began after December 31, 2002, are covered by defined contribution plans. Similar obligations as entitlement to severance payments also exist in other countries, where the Group provides employment.\n\nEmployees in Austria and Germany are entitled to jubilee payments after completion of a given number of years of service. These plans are non-contributory and unfunded.\n\nProvisions for pensions, severance payments and jubilee payments are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which divides the costs of the estimated",

Actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and severance payment obligations are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income. Such actuarial gains and losses are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Actuarial gains and losses on obligations for jubilee payments are recognized in profit or loss. Net interest expense is calculated on the basis of the net defined benefit obligation and disclosed as part of the financial result. Differences between the return on plan assets and interest income on plan assets included in the net interest expense is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nProvisions for voluntary and mandatory separations under restructuring programs are recognized if a detailed plan has been approved by management and communicated to those affected prior to the statement of financial position date and an irrevocable commitment is thereby established. Expenses related to such restructuring programs are included in the line Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. Voluntary modifications to employees' remuneration arrangements are recognized on the basis of the expected number of employees accepting the employing company's offer. Provisions for obligations related to individual separation agreements which lead to fixed payments over a defined period of time are recognized at the present value of the obligation.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Pensions and similar obligations\n\nThe projected unit credit method calculation of provisions for pensions, severance and jubilee entitlements requires estimates of discount rates, future increases in salaries and future increases in pensions. For current actuarial assumptions for calculating expected defined benefit entitlements and their sensitivity analysis see Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nThe biometrical basis for the calculation of provisions for pensions, severance and jubilee entitlements of Austrian Group companies is provided by AV\u00d6 2018 P - Rechnungsgrundlagen f\u00fcr die Pensionsversicherung (Biometric Tables for Pension Insurance) - Pagler & Pagler, using the variant for salaried employees. In other countries, similar actuarial parameters are used. Employee turnover was computed based on age or years of service, respectively. The expected retirement age used for calculations is based on the relevant country's legislation.\n\nProvision for onerous contracts are recognized for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting a contractual obligation exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract. These provisions are measured at the lower amount of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any potential penalties or compensation arising in the event of non-performance.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Provisions for onerous contracts\n\nOMV concluded in the past several long-term, noncancellable contracts that became onerous due to negative developments of market conditions. This led to the recognition of onerous contract provisions in the Group's financial statements for the unavoidable costs of meeting the contract obligations.\n\nThe estimates used for calculating the positive contributions that partly cover the fixed costs were based on external sources and management expectations. For more details see Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nEmission allowances received free of chargefrom governmental authorities (EU Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions allowances), reduce financial obligations related to CO2 emissions; provisions are recognized only for shortfalls (see Note 23 - Provisions).\n\n## t) Non-derivative financial liabilities\n\nLiabilities are carried at amortized cost, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are recognized at fair value. Long-term liabilities are discounted using the effective interest rate method.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance determined according to the expected credit losses model and the amount initially recognized less the cumulative income recognized according to IFRS 15.\n\n## u) Taxes on income and deferred taxes\n\nIn addition to corporate income taxes and trade earnings taxes, typical E&P taxes from oil and gas production like the country's/national oil company's profit share for certain EPSAs (see 2.2f) are disclosed as income taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences.",

This assessment of recoverability requires assumptions regarding future taxable profits and is therefore uncertain. In OMV, this assessment is based on detailed tax plannings which covers in E&P entities the  life span of field and a five year period in the other entities.\n\nChanges in the assumptions regarding future taxable profits can lead to an increase or decrease of the amount of deferred tax assets recognized which has an impact on the net income in the period in which the change occurs.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities at Group level are shown net, when there is a right of set-off and the taxes relate to matters subject to the same tax jurisdiction.\n\n## v) Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plans and Equity Deferral\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) OMV's main equity settled plan - is estimated using a model which is based on the expected target achievements and the expected share prices. For cash-settled awards, a provision based on the fair value of the amount payable is built up over the vesting period, so that by the end of the vesting period the fair value of the bonus shares to be granted is fully provided for. The provision is remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. For share settled awards, the grant date fair value is recognized as an expense (including income tax), with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as expense is adjusted to subsequent changes in parameters other than market parameters. In addition, the Equity Deferral part of the annual bonus is settled in shares. Accordingly, the related expense is recognized against equity. For share-based awards, the award is settled net of tax to the participants.\n\n## w) Fair value measurement\n\nThe fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be transferred at the measurement date, based on the assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use into account.\n\nFair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1:    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For OMV Group this category will, in most cases, only be relevant for securities, bonds, investment funds and futures contracts.\n\n- Level 2: as inputs to the valuation model. In addition\n\nValuation technique using directly or indirectly observables inputs. In order to determine the fair value for financial instruments within Level 2, usually forward prices of crude oil or natural gas, interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used counterparty credit risk as well as volatility indicators, if applicable, are taken into account.\n\n- Level 3: unobservable inputs (e.g. long-term price\n\nValuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models using significant assumptions and reserves estimates).\n\n## x) Foreign currency translation\n\nMonetary foreign currency balances are measured at closing rates, and exchange gains and losses accrued at statement of financial position date are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe financial statements of Group companies with functional currencies different from the Group's presentation currency are translated using the closing rate method. Differences arising from statement of financial position items translated at closing rates are disclosed in other comprehensive income. Income statement items are translated at average rates for the period. The use of average rates for the income statement creates additional differences compared to the application of the closing rates in the statement of financial position which are directly adjusted in other comprehensive income.",

Major changes in consolidated Group are described below.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials\n\nOn June 3, 2022, Borouge PLC has successfully listed on ADX, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. Following the IPO (Initial Public Offering), the shareholding in Borouge PLC has changed to Borealis owning a 36% stake in Borouge PLC and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company owning 54% respectively. For details refer to Note 16 - Equity-accounted investments.\n\nBased on the final offer price of AED 2.45 per share, the IPO has raised gross proceeds of EUR 1.9 bn for the offering of 10% of the company's total issued share capital. This transaction led to a net gain (including FX recycling effects) of EUR 341 mn, which is part of the line 'Other operating income' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nOn May 1, 2022, OMV closed the transaction to sell its filling station business in Germany to EG Group. The agreed purchase price before customary closing adjustments amounted to EUR 485 mn. The transaction led to a gain of EUR 409 mn recognized in the line 'Other operating income' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\nOMV ceased to fully consolidate JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development (YRGM) and to equity account for OJSC Severneftegazprom (SNGP) and therefore, starting March 1, 2022, the investments in SNGP and YRGM are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss according to IFRS 9.

Internal reporting and the relevant information provided to the chief operating decision-maker in order to assess performance and allocate resources has been updated to reflect the current organizational structure.\n\n## Business operations and key markets\n\nFor business management purposes, OMV is divided into three operating Business Segments: Chemicals & Materials, Refining & Marketing, and Exploration & Production, as well as the segment Corporate and Other (C&O). Each segment represents a strategic unit and operates in different markets. Each Business Segment is managed independently. Strategic business decisions are made by the Executive Board of OMV. With the exception of C&O, the reportable segments of OMV are the same as the operating segments.\n\nThe Chemicals & Materials (C&M) Business Segment is one of the world's leading providers of advanced and circular polyolefin solutions and a European market leader in base chemicals, fertilizers, and plastics recycling.\n\nOMV Group has a production capacity, including joint ventures, of 7.5 mn t base chemicals, 5.9 mn t polyolefins, 0.4 mn t compounding and 4.3 mn t fertilizers. The majority of production is located in Europe, with two overseas manufacturing facilities in the United States, one in Brazil and one in South Korea. In addition, OMV holds minority stakes in various equity-accounted investments, the most significant ones being Borouge (United Arab Emirates) a Borealis' joint venture with ADNOC that operates the largest petrochemical complex in the world and the Baystar joint venture (Pasadena, United States) which serves the customer base in the North American markets and operates Port Arthur Refinery with the production capacity of 0.5 mn t OMV share.\n\nOMV group is pursuing various initiatives in mechanical and chemical recycling and renewable polyolefins. A new polyethylene plant based on Borstar technology on the site in Pasadena is currently under construction with the target to deliver a broad range of products to meet the growing global demand of sustainable and high energy efficient plastic products.\n\nThe Refining & Marketing (R&M) Business Segment refines and markets crude oil and other feedstock. It operates the refineries Schwechat (Austria), Burghausen (Germany) and Petrobrazi (Romania) with an annual capacity of 17.8 mn t. In these refineries, crude oil is processed into petroleum products, which are sold to commercial and private customers. The activities of this business segment also cover supply and marketing of gas in Eastern Europe and the Group's power business activities, with one gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\nOMV has a strong position in the markets located within the areas of its supply, serving commercial customers, and operating a retail business of approximately 1,800 filling stations.\n\nOMV holds minority stakes in various equity-accounted investments, the most significant one is the 15% participation in ADNOC Refining (United Arab Emirates) with annual capacity of 7.1 mn t OMV share.\n\nExploration & Production (E&P) engages in the business of oil and gas exploration, development and production and focuses on the regions Central and Eastern Europe, North Sea, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. In addition, E&P is engaged in gas supply, marketing, trading, and logistics in Western Europe.\n\nGroup management, financing and insurance activities as well as certain service functions are concentrated in the Corporate & Other (C&O) segment.\n\nOne of the key measures of operating performance for the Group is Clean CCS Operating Result. Total assets include intangible assets as well as property, plant and equipment. Sales to external customers are split up by geographical areas on the basis of where the risk is transferred to the customers. The net revenues of commodity trading activities within the scope of IFRS 9 and hedging results are reported in the country in which the reporting subsidiary is located. Accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with certain exceptions for intra-group sales and cost allocations by the parent company, which are determined in accordance with internal OMV policies. Management is of the opinion that the transfer prices of goods and services exchanged between segments correspond to market prices. Business transactions not attributable to operating segments are included in the results of the C&O segment.",

        "page_content": "The disclosure of special items is considered appropriate in order to facilitate analysis of ordinary business performance. To reflect comparable figures, certain items affecting the result are added back or deducted. These items can be divided into four subcategories: personnel restructuring, unscheduled depreciation and write-ups, asset disposals and other. Furthermore, to enable effective performance management in an environment of volatile prices and comparability with peers, the CCS effect is eliminated from the accounting result. The CCS effect, also called inventory holding gains and\n\nlosses, is the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the current cost of supply, and the cost of sales calculated using the weighted average method after adjusting for any changes in valuation allowances. In volatile energy markets, measurement of the costs of petroleum products sold based on historical values (e.g. weighted average cost) can have distorting effects on reported results. This performance measurement enhances the transparency of results and is commonly used in the oil industry. OMV, therefore, publishes this measure in addition to the Operating Result determined according to IFRS.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\n| In EUR mn                                                 | 2022    | 2022    | 2022    | 2022   | 2022     | 2022            | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|----------|-----------------|------------|\n|                                                           | C&M     | R&M     | E&P     | C&O    | Total    | Consoli- dation | OMV  Group |\n| Sales revenues 1                                          | 13,450  | 28,634  | 30,857  | 424    | 73,365   | (11,067)        | 62,298     |\n| Intersegmental sales                                      | (1,181) | (2,818) | (6,661) | (407)  | (11,067) | 11,067          | -          |\n| Sales to third parties                                    | 12,269  | 25,816  | 24,197  | 17     | 62,298   | -               | 62,298     |\n| Other operating income                                    | 548     | 857     | 181     | 58     | 1,644    | -               | 1,644      |\n| Net income from equity-accounted invest- ments            | 332     | 477     | 60      | -      | 869      | -               | 869        |\n| Depreciation and amortization                             | 533     | 422     | 1,478   | 41     | 2,474    | -               | 2,474      |\n| Impairment losses (incl. exploration  & appraisal)        | 7       | 15      | 825     | 7      | 853      | -               | 853        |\n| Write-ups                                                 | 266     | 68      | 327     | -      | 660      | -               | 660        |\n| Operating Result                                          | 2,039   | 3,392   | 6,936   | (86)   | 12,281   | (35)            | 12,246     |\n| Special items for personnel restructuring                 | -       | 2       | 1       | 4      | 8        | -               | 8          |\n| Special items for unscheduled depreciation  and write-ups | (263)   | (47)    | 252     | -      | (58)     | -               | (58)       |\n| Special items for asset disposal                          | (315)   | (409)   | -       | -      | (724)    | -               | (724)      |\n| Other special items                                       | (4)     | (321)   | 207     | 31     | (87)     | -               | (87)       |\n| Special items                                             | (582)   | (774)   | 460     | 36     | (861)    | -               | (861)      |\n| Clean Operating Result                                    | 1,457   | 2,618   | 7,396   | (50)   | 11,420   | (35)            | 11,385     |\n| CCS effect                                                | -       | (202)   | -       | -      | (202)    | (8)             | (210)      |\n| Clean CCS Operating Result                                | 1,457   | 2,415   |         |        |          |                 |            |\n| 2                                                         |         |         | 7,396   | (50)   | 11,218   | (43)            | 11,175     |\n| Segment assets                                            | 5,964   | 4,223   | 11,407  | 234    | 21,826   | -               | 21,826     |\n| Additions in PPE/IA 3                                     | 1,285   | 826     | 1,512   | 41     | 3,664    | -               | 3,664      |\n| Equity-accounted investments 4                            | 5,179   | 1,765   | 350     | -      | 7,294    | -               | 7,294      |\n\n- 1 Including intersegmental sales\n- 2 Property, plant and equipment (PPE), intangible assets (IA), not including assets reclassified to assets held for sale\n- 3 Excluding additions in assets reclassified to held for sale and additions to decommissioning assets\n- 4 Excluding assets held for sale",

        "page_content": "## Impairments and write-ups in Refining & Marketing\n\nIn 2022, there was a net write-up of EUR 67 mn of the ADNOC Refining and Trading CGU, mainly related to the impairment testing triggered by the positive nearterm margin outlook for refining margins in Middle East.\n\nIn 2021, the deterioration in the margin outlook led to a change in price assumptions and triggered impairment testing in the ADNOC Refining and Trading CGU. This led to an impairment of EUR 669 mn due to lower refining margins and production volumes in ADNOC Refining.\n\n## Impairments and write-ups in Exploration & Production\n\nIn Q4/22, OMV updated its commodity price assumptions. Whereas the European gas prices increased for the near and long-term, the expected production volume of some oil and gas assets in Romania decreased due to higher expected natural decline rates and operating costs increased. These effects led to pre-tax impairments of EUR 117 mn (net of write-ups) of some development and production oil and gas assets, related to assets in Romania, New Zealand and Austria. For more details on price assumptions see Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates.\n\n## Exploration & Production impairments and write-ups based on impairment testing in Q4/22\n\n| Country     | Pre-tax impair- ments net of  write-ups   | Value in use  of assets  impacted   | After-tax  discount  rate   |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| New Zealand | (173)                                     | 881                                 | 8.93%                       |\n| Romania     | 367                                       | 1,910                               | 10.28%                      |\n| Austria     | (78)                                      | 1,090                               | 8.94%                       |\n\nIn 2022 reported impairment losses attributable to exploration and appraisal (EUR 183 mn) were mainly related to unsuccessful exploration wells and exploration licenses in Norway, New Zealand, Romania and Australia.\n\nAdditionally, impairments in 2022 included mainly unsuccessful workovers, obsolete or replaced assets in Romania (EUR 84 mn) and a production license in Libya (EUR 70 mn).\n\nThe planned sale of OMVs relevant operating entities in Yemen in Q2/22 led to the reclassification to 'held for sale', which triggered a pre-tax impairment of EUR 48 mn. For more details please see Note 20 - Assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\nIn 2021 based on impairment testing EUR 111 mn of exploration and appraisal assets were impaired, mainly related to assets in Norway, New Zealand, Mexico and Tunisia. Furthermore, impairment losses in 2021 included impairments of EUR 74 mn mainly related to unsuccessfull exploration wells and exploration licenses in Australia, Norway, Romania and New Zealand.\n\nOther impairments in 2021 were mainly related to unsuccessful workovers and obsolete or replaced assets in Romania (EUR 87 mn).\n\nFor further information related to significant judgements and assumptions with regards to impairment testing refer to Note 2 - Accounting Policies, judgements and estimates.",

For further details see Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nCapitalized borrowings costs applied to the carrying value of qualifying assets were mainly related to propane dehydrogenation plant under construction at the Borealis production site in Kallo, Belgium and construction of the ReOil and Bio-Oil plant in Austria.\n\n## Other financial income and expense\n\n| In EUR mn                                          |          |         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                                                    | 2022     | 2021    |\n| Carrying amount of sold trade receivables          | (10,857) | (9,348) |\n| Proceeds on sold trade receivables                 | 10,811   | 9,315   |\n| Financing charges for factoring and securitization | (46)     | (33)    |\n| Net foreign exchange gains/(losses)                | 95       | 9       |\n| Other                                              | (1,393)  | (17)    |\n| Other financial income and expense                 | (1,345)  | (40)    |\n\nIn 2022 net foreign exchange gains were predominantly impacted by USD and were partly offset by NOK.\n\nThe position Other was mainly related to impairment of the Nord Stream 2 loan (EUR 1,004 mn) and fair value\n\nadjustment of investments in Russia (EUR 370 mn).

Dividends from EU- and EEA-participations as well as from subsidiaries whose residence state has a comprehensive mutual administrative assistance agreement with Austria are exempt from taxation in Austria if certain conditions are fulfilled. Dividends from other foreign investments that are comparable to Austrian corporations, for which the\n\nGroup holds a 10% investment share or more for a minimum period of one year, are also excluded from taxation at the level of the Austrian parent company.\n\nChange in valuation allowance of deferred taxes for the Austrian tax group was reported in the income statement, except to the extent that the deferred tax assets arose from transactions or events which were recognized outside profit or loss, i.e. in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of income tax to profit before tax.

Increase in the effects related to differing foreign tax rates as compared to 2021 was mostly due to significant growth in profit before tax of those subsidiaries.\n\nNon-deductible expenses contained mainly losses from fair value changes of financial assets, effects related to deconsolidation of JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development and permanent effects from depreciation, depletion and amortization.\n\nNon-taxable income and tax incentives in 2022 mainly related to non-taxble gains on the sale of the filling station business in Germany. 2021 was predominantly impacted by the gains on the sale of Wisting field and tax incentives in Norway.\n\nIncome and expenses related to at-equity accounted investments effects in 2022 were mainly related to share of profit from equity-accounted investments, gains from the sucessful listing of Borouge PLC on ADX (the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange) and write -up of investment in ADNOC Refining. 2021 was mainly impacted by the share of profit from equity-accounted investments and ADNOC Refining impairment.

Based on the Eco Social Tax Reform Act which was adopted by the National Parliament of Austria in January 2022, corporate income tax rate will be decreased from 25% to 24% in 2023 and further to 23% from 2024 onward.\n\nTax write-downs and write-ups on investments in subsidiaries in 2022 were mainly related to the tax impairment of the investment in JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development.\n\n## Change in valuation allowance for deferred taxes\n\nwas predominately impacted by the increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in Austria. For further details see Note 25 - Deferred Taxes.\n\nTaxes related to previous years in 2022 were mainly related to the effects on the sale of the filling stations business in Germany and effects related to differences between functional currency and tax currency of certain subsidiaries.\n\nOther effects in 2022 included EU solidarity contribution in the amount EUR 90 mn. As a direct consequence to the energy crisis in Europe, regulatory measures like price caps, subsidy schemes and the EU solidarity contribution are being implemented in some of the countries the OMV Group is active in.

For details see Note 3 - Changes in group structure and Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates, section 'Impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related significant estimates and assumptions'.\n\nAdditions to intangible assets in 2022 included EUR 37 mn (2021: EUR 33 mn) additions for internally generated assets mainly related to capitalized development costs.\n\nThe transfers were mainly related to the shift of Berling project (Norway) to development assets following the final investment decision.\n\nIntangible assets with a total carrying amount of EUR 27 mn were reclassified back from assets held for sale to intangible assets, mainly related to OMV's share in the Maari field in New Zealand. For details see Note 20 - Assets and liabilities held for sale. In 2021 the intangible assets transferred to assets held for sale amounted to EUR 74 mn, mainly related to OMV's 25% stake in the Norwegian oil field Wisting, which was sold in Q4/21.\n\nFurther details on impairments and write-ups can be found in Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups.\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations has been allocated to the following CGUs and groups of CGUs, for impairment testing:\n\n## Goodwill allocation\n\n|                                                | In EUR mn   |   In EUR mn |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                | 2022        |        2021 |\n| Middle East and Africa                         | 342         |         322 |\n| SapuraOMV                                      | 210         |         198 |\n| Goodwill allocated to Exploration & Production | 552         |         520 |\n| Refining West                                  | -           |           9 |\n| Retail Slovakia                                | 7           |           7 |\n| Refining Austria                               | 26          |          26 |\n| Goodwill allocated to Refining & Marketing     | 33          |          42 |\n| Goodwill                                       | 585         |         562 |\n\nIn 2022, the goodwill allocated to Exploration & Production increased due to favorable currency translation differences.\n\nGoodwill impairment tests based on a value in use calculation have been performed and did not lead to any impairments. For the impairment test of the goodwill allocated to Middle East and Africa, an after-tax discount rate of 10.47% (2021: 9.44%) and for goodwill allocated to SapuraOMV an after-tax discount rate of 9.07% (2021: 8.00%) was used.\n\nAn after-tax discount rate of 12.67% (2021: 12.73%) related to the goodwill allocated to Middle East and Africa\n\nwould lead to zero headroom. The increase of 1 percentage in the after-tax discount rate for the goodwill allocated to SapuraOMV would led to an after-tax impairment of EUR 38 mn. For details regarding changes in price assumptions including the impact on goodwill refer to Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates.\n\nFor details on contractual obligations for the acquisition of intangible assets refer to Note 15 - Property, plant and equipment.",

The increase of contractual obligations in 2022 was mainly related to commitments in Norway and Romania.\n\n## OMV as a lessee\n\nThe increase in right of use assets is mainly driven by new leasing contracts for storage infrastructure related to the propane dehydrogenation plant (PDH) in Kallo, Belgium.",

        "page_content": "## 16  Equity-accounted investments\n\n## Material associates and joint ventures\n\nFollowing the Initial Public Offering (IPO) on June 3, 2022 the shareholding in Borouge PLC (PLC) has changed to Borealis owning a 36% stake in Borouge PLC and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company owning 54% respectively. The Borouge 4 project, which is currently being executed, has not been part of the offering. It is intended to recontribute Borouge 4 at a later point in time. PLC is registered in Abu Dhabi and is the holding company for its 100% interest in Abu Dhabi Polymers Company Limited (Borouge) (ADP) and its 84.75% interest in Borouge Pte. Ltd. (PTE). Before the IPO OMV held a 40% stake in ADP, which also included the Borouge 4 project, and a 50% stake in PTE. In 2022, OMV's share in PTE changed, following the IPO, from a 50% (direct) share in 2021 to a 45.76% share (15.25% direct share and 30.51% indirect share through PLC). For the impact on the consolidated income and cash flow statement refer to Note 3 Changes in group structure.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Group's interest in PLC, which is listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange of United Arab Emirates (UAE), was EUR 6,989 mn, based on the quoted market price available on the stock exchange of UAE. The corresponding book value of PLC was EUR 3,944 mn as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe 'Borouge investments' (representing total OMV share in PLC, ADP, PTE) are a leading provider of innovative, value-creating plastic solutions for energy, infrastructure, automotive, healthcare and agriculture industries as well as advanced packaging applications and also responsible for marketing and sales of the products produced.\n\nDue to the restructuring of the Borouge entities triggered by the IPO in 2022 the previous control assessment was revised. Given the fact that no Board Reserved Matters, which are affecting all relevant activities, can be decided without an affirmative vote of Borealis, OMV has joint control over the three investments. Furthermore, it was concluded that already in previous years joint control was exercised and therefore the presentation within this Note was adjusted accordingly (included in below tables as 'joint venture' instead of 'associate').\n\nBayport Polymers LLC , registered in Pasadena (incorporated in Wilmington), successfully started its operations of the new one million ton-per-year ethane cracker at the Port Arthur Refinery and is currently building a polyethylene unit in Pasadena with the target to deliver a broad range of products to meet the growing global demand of sustainable and high energy efficient plastic products. As OMV has joint control over Bayport Polymers LLC (50/50 share split) and rights to the net assets, it therefore accounts the company as joint venture.\n\nOMV also holds a 15% (2021: 15%) interest in Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company , registered in Abu Dhabi, which runs a refinery hub with integrated petrochemicals. According to the contractual agreement between the shareholders, OMV has strong participation rights which represent significant influence as per IAS 28 definition. In 2022, a net write-up of EUR 67 mn was recognized in ADNOC Refining and Trading CGU (in 2021 impairment of EUR 669 mn).

For details refer to the description above.\n\n## Individually immaterial associates and joint ventures\n\nOMV holds 55.6% (2021: 55.6%) of Erd\u00f6l-Lagergesellschaft m.b.H (ELG), registered in Lannach, which is holding the major part of the emergency stock of crude and petroleum products in Austria. In spite of holding the majority of voting rights in the general assembly, OMV does not have control over ELG. The significant decisions on the financial and operating policies are delegated to the standing shareholder's committee in which a quorum of two thirds of the share capital is required for decisions.\n\nSince March 2022, OMV has 40% interest through Borealis in Borouge 4 LLC , registered in Abu Dhabi. The company executes the ongoing Borouge 4 project by developing an ethane-based steam cracker, two polyolefin plants, a 1-Hexene unit, a cross-linked polyethylene plant (XPLE) and an in-depth study for carbon capture unit. It was previously part of the 40% direct interest in ADP but scoped out of the IPO in June 2022, as described above, and therefore transferred to this newly founded company. However, it is intended to recontribute Borouge 4 at a later point. Given the fact that no Board Reserved Matters, which are affecting all relevant activities can be decided without an affirmative vote by Borealis, OMV has joint control over Borouge 4 LLC and accounts for it as joint venture.\n\nOMV exercises joint control over Abu Dhabi Petroleum Investments LLC (ADPINV, OMV's interest 25%, 2021: 25%), registered in Abu Dhabi, and Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO; indirect interest of OMV amounts to 10%, 2021: 10%), registered in Karachi, and accounts both investments at-equity. ADPINV is a holding company for its 40% interest in PARCO. As unanimous consent of the parties is required for decisions about relevant activities and OMV has rights to the net assets based on the legal structure, OMV classified the companies as joint ventures according to IFRS 11.\n\nIn June 2021, OMV subscribed through Borealis to a new share issue, thus acquiring 10% in Renasci N.V. , a company incorporated in Belgium. On November 9, 2022 as a result of the debt conversion into newly issued shares, OMV has increased its stake in Renasci N.V. from 10% to 27.42%. The nominal amount of the loan converted was EUR 24 mn. Renasci N.V. is principally engaged in the development of the proprietary processes and know-how about various technologies regarding waste treatment and recycling. Through the shareholder agreement, Borealis is guaranteed two seats on the board of Renasci N.V. and participates in major significant financial and operating decisions. The Group has therefore determined that it has significant influence over this entity. Therefore, the investment is accounted for as an associated company.",

According to the contractual agreement between OMV and Pearl Petroleum Company Limited (Pearl), OMV has significant influence within the meaning of IAS 28, as unanimous consent is required for\n\nsome strategic decisions. Therefore, Pearl is accounted for using the equity method although OMV's share is just 10%.\n\nFor further details, please refer to Note 38 - Direct and indirect investments of OMV Aktiengesellschaft.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income for individually immaterial associates and joint ventures - Group's share 1\n\n| In EUR mn                  |            |                |            |                |\n|----------------------------|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|\n|                            | 2022       | 2022           | 2021       | 2021           |\n|                            | Associates | Joint ventures | Associates | Joint ventures |\n| Sales revenue              | 5,889      | 461            | 3,314      | 5,516          |\n| Net income for the year    | 189        | 30             | 86         | 58             |\n| Other comprehensive income | 0          | (2)            | -          | 1              |\n| Total comprehensive income | 190        | 27             | 86         | 58             |\n\n## Carrying amount reconciliation for individually immaterial associates and joint ventures 1\n\n| In EUR mn                               | 2022  2021                  | 2022  2021                  | 2022  2021                  | 2022  2021                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                         | Associates 2 Joint ventures | Associates 2 Joint ventures | Associates 2 Joint ventures | Associates 2 Joint ventures |\n| January 1                               | 541                         | 416                         | 501                         | 391                         |\n| Currency translation differences        | (8)                         | (13)                        | 33                          | 24                          |\n| Changes in consolidated group 3         | (89)                        | -                           | 25                          | (15)  -                     |\n| Transfer 4                              | -                           | (337)                       | -                           | -                           |\n| Additions and other changes  Net income | 24    189                   | 409 5 30                    | -    86                     | 58                          |\n| Other comprehensive income              | 0                           | (2)                         | -                           | 1                           |\n| Disposals and other changes             |                             |                             | (55)                        |                             |\n| Dividends distributed                   | (1)                         | -                           | (50)                        | -                           |\n| December 31                             | (88)    568                 | (5)    498                  | 541                         | (42)                        |\n\n- 1 The presentation within this table was adjusted for 2021 due to control re-assessment for PTE: included as 'joint venture' instead of 'associate'\n- 2 Includes associated companies accounted at-cost\n- 3 Changes in consolidated group represent the deconsolidation of OJSC Severneftegazprom.

This led to the reclassification of the disposal group to assets and liabilities held for sale without having an impact on the income statement at that time. The Borealis Group's share in fertilizer production sites in the Netherlands and Belgium ('Rosier') was not considered as part of the potential sales process at that time and its assets and related liabilities do not belong to the Borealis nitrogen business unit held for sale.\n\nThe period to complete the sale was extended by events and circumstances beyond OMV's control. The developments resulting from the war in Ukraine and re-\n\nlated sanctions caused Borealis to decline a binding offer received from EuroChem in February 2022 and to consider other options. On July 28, 2022, Borealis accepted a new binding offer from AGROFERT, a.s. which was received on June 2, 2022, after the mandatory information and consultation procedures with employee representatives were finalized. On the same date, both companies entered into an agreement to sell and transfer all shares in the legal entities included in the scope of the transaction. The transaction itself remains subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nIn 2022 a write-up was recognized based on the offer received from AGROFERT, a.s. while in 2021 impairment loss was recognized based on the binding offer from EuroChem. For further details see Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups.\n\nOMV determines the net position of emission certificates for the Group.

        "page_content": "(market value: EUR 179 mn) related to the nitrogen business unit was not included in the balance sheet line 'Liabilities associated with assets held for sale', due to the net presentation policy.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the remaining part of assets held for sale and liabilites associated with asset held for sale in Chemicals & Materials was related to Rosier. On September 26, 2022, a binding agreement for the acquisition of Borealis' shares in Rosier S.A. was signed with the YILDIRIM Group's YILFERT Holding. This led to the reclassification of Rosier to assets and liabilities held for sale without having material impact on the income statement at that time.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nOn May 1, 2022, OMV finalized the sale of the filling station business in Germany to EG Group (285 filling stations in southern Germany, with a focus on Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). For further details regarding the effects of the sale please refer to Note 6 - Other operating income and net income from equity accounted investments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in Refining & Marketing related mostly to OMV retail business in Slovenia.\n\nDuring 2021 OMV decided to sell its retail business in Slovenia (120 filling stations) which led to the reclassification to assets and liabilities to held for sale. This reclassification did not lead to an impairment loss. On June 8, 2021 OMV and MOL Group reached an agreement for MOL Group to acquire OMV Slovenia. The\n\ntransaction is subject to required regulatory approvals and closing is expected in 2023.\n\nOther assets and liabilities held for sale in Refining & Marketing related mostly to 17 Avanti filling stations in Germany. During 2022, OMV decided to sell the filling stations in Germany held under 'Avanti' brand which led to the reclassification to assets and liabilities to held for sale. This reclassification did not have an impact on the income statement. Closing of the transaction is expected in 2023.\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in Exploration & Production were entirely related to Yemen operating entities. During 2022, OMV decided to sell its relevant operating entities in Yemen and signed the sales agreement, which led to the reclassification to assets and liabilities to held for sale. As of the date of reclassification, the result of the measurement at fair value less cost of disposal has led to an impairment (see Note 7 Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in Exploration & Production entirely consisted of a 69% interest in Maari field, located in New Zealand's offshore Taranaki Basin. After ongoing engagement with Jadestone Energy as a potential buyer, a mutual decision has been made to no longer pursue the transaction. Therefore, assets and liabilites related to Maari field were reclassified back from the assets held for sale and liabilities associated with asset held for sale.",

        "page_content": "## 21  Equity of stockholders of the parent\n\n## Capital stock\n\nThe capital stock of OMV Aktiengesellschaft consists of 327,272,727 (2021: 327,272,727) fully paid no par value shares with a total nominal value of EUR 327,272,727 (2021: EUR 327,272,727). There are no different classes of shares and no shares with special rights of control. All shares are entitled to dividends for the financial year 2022, with the exception of treasury shares held by OMV Aktiengesellschaft.\n\nAs the authorized capital granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 14, 2014 expired on May 14, 2019, the Annual General Meeting decided upon a new authorized capital on September 29, 2020. Specifically, it authorized the Executive Board until September 29, 2025 to increase the share capital of OMV with the consent of the Supervisory Board - at once or in several tranches - by an amount of up to EUR 32,727,272 by issuing up to 32,727,272 new no-par value common voting shares in bearer form in return for contributions in cash. The capital increase can also be implemented by way of indirect offer for subscription after taking over by one or several credit institutions according to Section 153 Paragraph 6 Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The issue price and the conditions of issuance can be determined by the Executive Board with the consent of the Supervisory Board.\n\nFurther, the Annual General Meeting authorized the Executive Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders if the capital increase serves to (i) adjust fractional amounts or (ii) satisfy stock transfer programs, in particular long term incentive plans, equity deferrals or other participation programs for employees, senior employees and members of the Executive Board/management boards of the Company or one of its affiliates, or other employees stock ownership plans.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board was authorized to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association resulting from the issuance of shares according to the authorized capital.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves have been formed by the contribution of funds into OMV Aktiengesellschaft by its shareholders over and above the capital stock, on the basis of their ownership relationship.\n\n## Hybrid capital\n\nThe hybrid capital recognized in equity in the amount of EUR 2,483 mn consists of perpetual, subordinated hybrid notes. According to IFRS, the net proceeds of the hybrid notes are fully treated as equity because the repayment of the principal and the payments of interest are solely at the discretion of OMV.\n\nOn December 7, 2015, OMV issued hybrid notes with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1,500 mn, in two tranches of EUR 750 mn:\n\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 1, with the first call date in 2021, were called and redeemed at their principal amount (plus interest accrued) on November 30, 2021.\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 2 bear a fixed interest rate of 6.250% per annum until, but excluding, December 9, 2025, which is the first call date of tranche 2. From December 9, 2025 (including), tranche 2 will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for the relevant interest period plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points.\n\nInterest is due and payable annually in arrears on December 9 of each year, unless OMV elects to defer the relevant interest payments. The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.\n\nOn June 19, 2018 OMV issued a hybrid bond with a principal amount of EUR 500 mn. The hybrid bond bears a fixed interest rate of 2.875% per annum until, but excluding, June 19, 2024. From June 19, 2024 (including), until, but excluding, June 19, 2028, the hybrid notes will bear interest at a rate corresponding to the relevant five-year swap rate plus a specified margin. From June 19, 2028 (including), the notes will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for the relevant interest period plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points. Interest is due and payable annually in arrears on June 19 of each year, unless OMV elects to defer the relevant interest payments. The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.",

From the first reset date (including), until, but excluding, September 1, 2030, the hybrid notes of tranche 1 will bear interest per annum at a reset interest rate which is determined according to the relevant five-year swap rate plus a specified margin. From September 1, 2030 (including), the hybrid notes of tranche 1 will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for each interest period thereafter plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points.\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 2 bear a fixed interest rate of 2.875% per annum until, but excluding September 1, 2029, which is the first reset date of tranche 2. From the first reset date (including), until, but excluding, September 1, 2030, the hybrid notes of tranche 2 will bear interest per annum at a reset interest rate which is determined according to the relevant five-year swap rate plus a specified margin. From September 1, 2030 (including), the hybrid notes of tranche 2 will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for each interest period thereafter plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points.\n\nInterest is due and payable annually in arrears on September 1 of each year, unless OMV elects to defer the relevant interest payments. The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.\n\nThe hybrid notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, do not have a scheduled maturity date and they may be redeemed at the option of OMV under certain\n\ncircumstances. OMV has, in particular, the right to repay the hybrid notes at certain call dates. Any accrued unpaid interest becomes payable when the notes are redeemed. In the case of a change of control, for example, OMV may call the hybrid notes for redemption or else the applicable interest rate will be subject to an increase according to the terms and conditions of the hybrid notes.\n\n## Revenue reserves\n\nThe Group's revenue reserves included the net income and losses of consolidated subsidiaries and equity accounted investments, as adjusted for the purposes of consolidation.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe Annual General Meetings for the years 2000 to 2011 (with the exception of 2010) and 2019 approved the repurchase of treasury shares. The costs of repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in equity. Gains or losses on the re-issue of treasury shares (issue proceeds less acquisition cost) result in an increase or a reduction in capital reserves.\n\nOn June 2, 2021 the Annual General Meeting authorized the Executive Board for a period of five years from the adoption of the resolution, therefore, until and including June 1, 2026, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to dispose of or utilize repurchased treasury shares or treasury shares already held by the Company to grant to employees, executive employees and/or members of the Executive Board/management boards of the Company or its affiliates including for purposes of share transfer programs, in particular long term incentive plans including equity deferrals or other stock ownership plans, and to thereby exclude the general purchasing right of shareholders (exclusion of subscription rights). The authorization can be exercised as a whole or in parts or even in several tranches by the Company, by a subsidiary (Section 189a number 7 Austrian Commercial Code) or by third parties for the account of the Company.",

The investment of plan assets in Austria is governed by section 25 Austrian Pension Fund Act and the Investment Fund Act. In addition to these regulations, the investment guidelines of APKPensionskasse AG regulate the spread of asset allocation, the use of umbrella funds and the selection of fund managers. The investment plans in Belgium follow the investment strategy of the respective insurance company as well as local legal regulations.\n\nThe allocation of plan assets was mainly in debt securities and insurance contracts. Except for the insurance contracts, which are not quoted, the majority of plan assets are invested in liquid active markets for which quoted prices are available.\n\nExpected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year 2023 are EUR 23 mn. Moreover, in 2023, defined benefit related contributions related to 2022 to external pension funds of EUR 55 mn are estimated.",

The present value of the provision as at December 31, 2022, was EUR 32 mn (2021: EUR 390 mn). This steep decrease in provision reflects the change in LNG market condititions with higher realized LNG volumes and margins experienced in 2022, which is expected to persist to a certain extent also in the near future. The provision represents the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations. Thereby, income and costs from future purchases and sales of LNG are taken into account, since the regasification of LNG and subsequent sale of the gas positively contributes to the coverage of the fixed costs. The volume assumptions are based on management's best estimates of available LNG volumes in the future. The prices are based on forward rates, where available. If no forward prices are available, the prices represent management's best estimate of future prices, derived from current market prices or forward rates of the preceding period. The calculation is based on an interest rate of 2.53% (2021: 4.51%).\n\nAs per end of 2022, the provision for the related noncancellable transportation commitments of OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH amounted to EUR 188 mn (2021: EUR 65 mn). The increase in provision is mainly driven by additional transport capacities which were booked in order to secure alternative supply routes for Austria. The calculation is based on the difference between the fixed costs for using the capacities and the net profit from usage expected to be generated by using the capacities. The discount rate applied is 2.53% (2021: 4.51%). Besides the discount rate, the key assumptions are the gas prices at the relevant gas hubs which are based on forward rates or on management's best estimates of future prices.\n\nOther personnel provisions included short-term provisions related to personnel reduction schemes of EUR 13 mn (2021: EUR 17 mn).The remaining amount was mainly related to boni provisions.\n\nResidual other provisions increased in 2022 mainly in connection with other risks assessed by the Group in the area of gas and power taxation in Romania.\n\n## Emissions certificates\n\nDirective 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the European Council established a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, requiring member states to draw up national plans to allocate emissions certificates. Under this scheme, affected OMV Group companies are entitled to yearly allocation of free emissions certificates.\n\nThe New Zealand Government established a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme under the Climate\n\nthe privatization agreement. As of December 31, 2022, OMV Petrom SA held receivables from the Romanian state related to decommissioning and restoration costs amounting to EUR 326 mn (2021:EUR 352 mn).",

        "page_content": "Change Response Act 2002. Under this scheme New Zealand companies are not entitled to receive free emission certificates. OMV has purchased certificates to meet its own use liability. Apart from purchased certificates, each sale of gas to domestic customers in New Zealand creates an obligation for OMV. OMV receives units of emission certificates from customers to meet this obligation.\n\nIn Germany, the fuel emissions trading act (BEHG; Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz) came into force on December 20, 2019, and is the basis for German national certificate trading scheme for emissions from fossil fuels. It obliges the distributors - suppliers who deliver to end customers and/or who take the fuel from the pipeline network (origin of energy tax) - of fuels to acquire CO2 emission certificates from January 1, 2021\n\nonwards. According to Section 38 (2) of the Energy Tax Act, the tax debtor is the supplier; therefore, all companies in possession of an energy tax supplier's certificate are to be considered as distributors. Unlike under European Trading Scheme, certificates under BEHG are not eligible for trading and are not freely allocated, but have to be purchased from the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt; Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle).\n\nIn 2023 OMV expects to surrender 9,859 thousand emissions certificates from European Trading Scheme, 3,531 thousand BEHG certificates and 2,292 thousand NZ certificates for (not yet externally verified) emissions, out of which 2,187 thousand emissions certificates are expected to be transferred to OMV from customers in New Zealand.\n\n## Emissions certificates\n\n| Number of certificates, in thousands    |                           |                     |                     | 2021                      | 2021                | 2021                |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | European  Trading  Scheme | NZ  Trading  Scheme | DE  Trading  Scheme | European  Trading  Scheme | NZ  Trading  Scheme | DE  Trading  Scheme |\n| Certificates held as of January 1       | 11,731                    | 252                 | 3,617               | 12,210                    | 112                 | -                   |\n| Free allocation for the year            | 7,742                     | -                   | -                   | 5,891                     | -                   | -                   |\n| Certificates surrendered 1              | (10,792)                  | (2,567)             | (3,833)             | (10,795)                  | (2,884)             | -                   |\n| Net purchases and sales during the year | 4,889                     | 293                 | 3,398               | 4,424                     | 1,150               | 3,617               |\n| Certificates received from customers    | -                         | 3,924               | -                   | -                         | 1,873               | -                   |\n| Certificates held as of December 31     | 13,569                    | 1,901               | 3,183               | 11,731                    | 252                 | 3,617               |",

Under the arrangement, the bank agrees to pay amounts to a supplier participating in the program in respect of invoices owed by the Group and receives settlement from OMV later. The principal purpose of those programs is to facilitate efficient payment processing and enable the consenting suppliers to sell their receivables due from OMV to a bank before their maturity. The Group has not derecognized the majority of original liabilities to which the arrangement applies because neither legal release was obtained nor the original liability was substantially modified while entering into the arrangement. Most liabilities remain within trade payables and other financial liabilities until payment. From OMV's perspective, these arrangements do not significantly extend payment terms beyond the normal terms agreed with other suppliers that are not participating in the programs. Consequently, cash effects are included in the cashflow from operating activities.",

        "page_content": "Deferred taxes were mainly related to different valuation methods, differences in impairments, write-offs, write-ups and depreciation and amortization as well as different definition of costs.\n\nDecrease in deferred tax liabilities (DTL) related to intangible assets was mainly driven by deconsolidation of JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development. For further details see Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates, section 'Impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related significant estimates and assumptions'.\n\nIncrease in deferred tax assets (DTA) related to tax impairments was mainly drived by the impairment of investment in JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development. For further details see Note 12 - Taxes on income and profit.\n\nThe overall net DTA position of tax jurisdictions which suffered a tax loss either in current or preceding year amounted to EUR 682 mn, thereof EUR 522 mn is attributable to the Austrian tax group (2021:\n\nEUR 901 mn, thereof Austrian tax group EUR 658 mn).\n\nIn 2022 as well as in the previous year, a valuation allowance for DTA for the Austrian tax group was recognized. DTA recognized for the AT Tax Group as of December 31, 2022 reflects the expected utilization of deductible temporary differences of balance sheet items and tax losses carried forward based on the mid term plan for the period 2023 - 2027. Limitation to the usage of tax losses of 75%, as stipulated by the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act, was considered in the assessment of the recoverable DTA within the planning period. Remaining DTL after the planning period are mainly expected to be offset with DTA from temporary differences. Any remaining DTL after netting is assumed to be offset with DTA from tax losses, therefore the limitation to the usage of tax losses have not been considered after the planning period. This is also supported by the fact that tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period of time.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, OMV recognized tax losses carryforward of EUR 6,758 mn before allowances (2021: EUR 5,839 mn), thereof EUR 3,460 mn (2021: EUR 3,202 mn) are considered recoverable for calculation of deferred taxes.\n\nEligibility of losses for carryforward expires as follows:\n\n## Tax losses carryforward 1\n\n|                         | In EUR mn                            | In EUR mn               | In EUR mn                            | In EUR mn               |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                         | 2022                                 | 2022                    | 2021                                 | 2021                    |\n|                         | Base  amount  (before allo-  wances) | thereof not  recognized | Base  amount  (before allo-  wances) | thereof not  recognized |\n| 2022                    | -                                    | -                       | 30                                   | 30                      |\n| 2023                    | 18                                   | 18                      | 18                                   | 18                      |\n| 2024                    | 2                                    | 2                       | 2                                    | 2                       |\n| 2025                    | 11                                   | 11                      | 11                                   | 11                      |\n| 2026                    | 3                                    | 3                       | 3                                    | 3                       |\n| 2027                    | 3                                    | 3                       | 0                                    | 0                       |\n| After 2027/2026         | 55                                   | 0                       | 0                                    | 0                       |\n| Unlimited               | 6,666                                | 3,261                   | 5,774                                | 2,573                   |\n| Tax losses carryforward | 6,758                                | 3,298                   | 5,839                                | 2,637                   |\n\nThe majority of tax losses carryforward not recognized referred to the Austrian Tax Group and France.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with fully consolidated and equity-accounted investments for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized\n\namounted to EUR 10,123 mn (2021: EUR 7,475 mn). Capital gains on disposals of investments may be realized on various levels of the Group depending on the structuring of potential divestments.

Management is of the opinion that litigations, to the extent not covered by provisions or insurance, there is either no present obligation and/or the outflow is remote and/or they will not materially affect the Group's financial position.\n\nOMV entered into guarantees as part of the ordinary course of the group's business, mainly under credit facilities granted by banks, without cash collateral. No material losses are likely to arise from such. Further information on financial guarantees are included in Note 28 - Risk Management.\n\nFinancing commitments provided to related parties are detailed in Note 35 - Related parties.\n\nOMV holds a 10% share in Pearl Petroleum Company Ltd. (Pearl) following an acquisition through a Share Sales Agreement of May 2009 (SSA). OMV was faced with a pending arbitration proceeding since 2020 (under the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) rules) launched by Crescent and Dana in respect of certain reserve-based contingent payments and alleged unjustified enrichment based on the SSA. In a final binding arbitral award of February 2023 the LCIA tribunal ruled in favor of OMV rejecting those claims and stating that there is no entitlement of Dana and Crescent of a contingent payment by OMV.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the Bulgarian Commission for Protection of Competition announced the initiation of an investigation regarding the determination of the prices on",

        "page_content": "fuel market. OMV Bulgaria EOOD is subject to this investigation, among other major manufacturers and retailers on Bulgarian market. During 2020 two requests of providing information were received from authorities and the responses were submitted in due time. There were no additional requests from authorities in 2021 and 2022, but the investigation is not yet finalized. The sanctions for antitrust infringements are up to 10% of the total company's turnover of the respective undertaking for the financial year prior to the sanctioning decision. At the date of these financial statements,OMV is not able to evaluate the outcome of the investigation and no provision was recorded in this respect.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, one other proceeding was pending against OMV related to local service contractors in one of the subsidiaries. OMV's share of claimed amount is around USD 330 mn. Management currently does not believe that any of the alleged matters will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations. However, this assessment is based on assumptions deemed reasonable by management including those about future events and uncertainties. The outcome of these matters is ultimately uncertain, such that unanticipated events and circumstances might occur that might cause management to change those assumptions and give rise to a material adverse effect on our financial position in the future.\n\n## 28  Risk management\n\n## Capital risk\n\nOMV's financial steering framework is built upon the principles of operational efficiency, capital efficiency, financing efficiency and sustainable portfolio management. With the focus on strengthening OMV's balance sheet, delivering a positive free cash flow and growing its profitability, the financial steering framework represents sustainable, risk-monitored and future-oriented value creation for OMV and its stakeholders.\n\nOMV manages its capital structure to safeguard its capital base in order to preserve investor, creditor and capital market confidence, as well as to provide a sustainable financial foundation for the future operational development of the Group. OMV's financing strategy focuses on cash flow and financial stability. Principal targets are a positive free cash flow after dividends and a strong investment grade credit rating on the basis of a healthy balance sheet and a long-term leverage ratio (defined as net debt including leases / (equity + net debt including leases) of below 30%.\n\n## Capital Management - key performance measures\n\n| In EUR mn (unless otherwise stated)   |        |        |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n| Bonds                                 | 7,320  | 8,070  |\n| Lease liabilities 1                   | 1,524  | 1,191  |\n| Other interest-bearing debts 1        | 1,487  | 1,765  |\n| Debt including leases                 | 10,331 | 11,026 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents 1           | 8,124  | 5,064  |\n| Net Debt including leases             | 2,207  | 5,962  |\n| Equity                                | 26,628 | 21,996 |\n| Leverage ratio including leases in %  | 8      | 21     |\n\n- 1 Including items that were reclassified to assets or liabilities held for sale\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nFor the purpose of assessing liquidity risk, yearly budgeted operating and financial cash flows of the Group are monitored and analyzed on a monthly basis. Thus, every month the Group generates a forecasted net change in liquidity, which is then compared to the total month end balances of money market deposits and loans, as well as to maturities of the current portfolio and the available liquidity reserves of the same month. This analysis provides the basis for financing decisions and capital commitments.\n\nTo ensure that OMV Group remains solvent at all times and retains the necessary financial flexibility, liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit lines and short term uncommitted money market lines are maintained. As of December 31, 2022, the average weighted maturity of the Group's debt portfolio (excluding lease liabilities) has been 4.6 years (as of December 31, 2021: 5.1 years).\n\nOMV Group's operational liquidity management is mainly handled via cash pooling systems, which enable",

The repayment was financed from the two tranches of senior notes in the amount of EUR 324 mn and EUR 278 mn, which mature in 2027 and 2032, respectively. Senior notes issued by Bayport Polymers LLC are fully guaranteed by Borealis AG. For further details see chapter 'Credit Risk Management'.\n\n## Market risk\n\nDerivative and non-derivative instruments are used to manage market price risks resulting from changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which could have a negative effect on assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.\n\nFor the purpose of mitigating market price risks, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as OTC swaps, options, futures and forwards.\n\nSwaps do not involve an investment at the time the contracts are concluded; settlement normally takes place at the end of the quarter or month. The premiums on purchased options are payable when the contract is concluded; where options are exercised, payment of the difference between strike price and average market price for the period takes place at contract expiration.\n\nCommodity price risk management refers to analysis, assessment, reporting and hedging of market price risk exposure arising from non-trading and trading activities, covering refining (refinery margin, inventories up to a defined threshold) as well as oil and gas marketing activities (marketing margin, inventories up to a defined threshold) and producing power (spark spreads) in addition to proprietary trading positions.\n\nLimited proprietary trading activities may be performed for the purpose of creating market access within the oil, power and gas markets up to a defined threshold.\n\nHedges are generally placed in the legal entities where the underlying exposure exists. When certain conditions are met, the Group may elect to apply IFRS 9 hedge accounting principles in order to recognize the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments at the same time as the hedged items.\n\nDerivatives are mostly used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments (i.e. hedge accounting is not applied), they are valued through profit or loss for accounting purposes.\n\nThe tables hereafter show the fair values of derivative financial instruments together with their notional amounts. The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of a derivative's underlying asset, reference rate or index and is the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured. The notional amounts indicate the volume of the transactions outstanding at the year-end and are not indicative of either the market risk or the credit risk.",

Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to those derivatives, except for the derivatives that are used to limit the price risk on the inventory held for immediate consumption. Contracts not designated as cash flow hedges are classified as fair value through profit or loss and stated at fair value.\n\nBorealis hedges its forecasted electricity purchases using electricity swaps.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nRefining & Marketing is exposed to market price risks arising from trading and non-trading activities, covering production, refining and marketing activities associated with crude oil, oil products, gas and electricity, in addition to limited proprietary trading positions aiming to create market access within oil and oil product markets.\n\nIn Refining & Marketing, derivative instruments are used for both hedging selected product sales and reducing exposure to price risks on inventory fluctuations. Crude oil and product swaps are used to hedge the refining margin (crack spread), which is the difference between crude oil prices and bulk product prices.\n\nFurthermore, exchange-traded oil futures as well as OTC contracts (contracts for difference and swaps) are used to hedge short-term purchase and sales market price risks.\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\nIn order to protect the Group's result and cash flow from the potential negative impact of falling oil and gas prices as well as to ensure sufficient liquidity headroom in order to enable the Group's growth strategy, OMV uses financial derivatives to secure favorable oil and gas prices from time to time. When doing so, OMV enters into derivative positions selling forward parts of its future production, thereby locking in future oil and gas prices and reducing exposure to market prices in the periods for which the hedges are concluded. OMV Group adopts a flexible approach to monetize hedges prior to their maturity with the aim to generate a positive contribution to the results.\n\nFurthermore, operational commodity price risk management in Exploration & Production includes hedging of\n\nmarket price risk exposure arising from non-trading and trading activities of gas marketing (hedge of the price risk on inventory fluctuations and the differences in terms and conditions of purchases and sales) as well as limited proprietary trading positions for the purpose of creating market access within the gas markets.\n\nFor all these derivative instruments no hedge accounting was applied.\n\n## Hedge Accounting in Chemicals & Materials and Refining & Marketing\n\nIn the Chemical & Materials and Refining & Marketing Business, OMV is especially exposed to volatile refining margins and inventory risks. In order to mitigate those risks corresponding hedging activities are taken, which include margin hedges, stock hedges, feedstock and commodity hedges. Additionally, cash flow hedge accounting is applied to forecast electricity purchases and forecast natural gas purchases. Also, a part of the hedges done for future sales and purchases of the crackers has been designated as cash flow hedge.\n\nThe risk management objective is to harmonize the pricing of product sales and purchases in order to remain within an approved range of priced stocks at all times, by means of undertaking stock hedges so as to mitigate the price exposure. The range is a defined maximum deviation from the target stock level, as defined in the Annual Plan for hedging activities.\n\nIn respect of refinery margin hedges, crude oil and products are hedged separately, with the aim to protect future margins. Endorsed mandates are documented and defined within the Annual plan for hedging activities.\n\nIn case of refinery margin hedges only the product crack spread is designated as the hedged item, buying Brent Crude Oil on a fixed basis and selling the product on a fixed basis. The crack spread for different products is a separately identifiable component and can therefore represent the specific risk component designated as hedged item. There are limits set for the volume of planned hedged sales to avoid over-hedging.\n\nFor refinery margin hedges, hedge accounting is applied to a limited extent.\n\nIn 2022, physical oil product exchange contracts have been concluded between OMV Group and national stockholding companies in Austria, Germany and Slovakia. In order to reduce the risk of market price fluctuations between the withdrawal and return of products, derivative swap deals (sell fix, buy floating at the time",

As of December 31, 2022, the product exchange transaction with the Austrian national stockholding company was fully completed.\n\nStock hedges are used to mitigate price exposure whenever actual priced stock levels deviate from target levels. Forecast sales for oil products and forecast purchase transactions for crude oil and oil products are designated as the hedged item. Historically, Brent crude oil has formed the largest risk component of the stock price, however in some cases also oil products are used for stock hedges. In such cases, Platts / Argus product price is used as the risk component. Other components like product crack spreads and other local market cost components are not hedged.The hedging relationships are established with a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the commodity derivatives are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge ineffectiveness can arise from timing differential between derivative and hedged item delivery and pricing differentials (derivatives are valued on the future monthly average price (or other periods) and sales/purchases on the pricing at the date of transaction/delivery).\n\nFor 'Forecast purchases' as well as the 'Hedge of a recognized liability' the hedge ineffectiveness is included in line item 'Purchases (net of inventory variation)' in OMV's Consolidated income statement. The hedge ineffectiveness and recycling of 'Forecast sales' for hedges where a risk component of the non-financial item is designated as the hedged item in the hedging relationship, is shown in line item 'Sales revenues' in OMV's Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\nOMV operates in many countries and currencies, therefore industry-specific activities and the corresponding foreign exchange rate risks need to be analyzed precisely. The USD represents OMV's biggest risk exposure, in the form of movement of the USD against the EUR and also against other main OMV Group currencies (RON, NOK, NZD and SEK). Movements of these currencies against the EUR are also important sources of risk. Other currencies have only a limited impact on cash flow and Operating result. The transaction risk on foreign currency cash flows is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group's long and short net position is reviewed at least on a semiannual basis and the sensitivity is calculated. This analysis provides the basis for management of transaction risks on currencies. Since OMV produces commodities that are mainly traded in USD, OMV Group has an economic USD long position.\n\nFX options, forwards and swaps are mainly used to hedge foreign exchange rate risks on outstanding receivables and payables. The market value of these instruments will move in the opposite direction to the value of the underlying receivable or liability if the relevant foreign exchange rate changes. When certain conditions are met, the Group may elect to apply IFRS 9 hedge accounting principles in order to recognize the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments at the same time as and the hedged items. Certain hedges, which refer to a forecasted currency position are therefore classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation risk is also monitored on an ongoing basis at Group level and the risk position is evaluated. Translation risk arises on the consolidation of subsidiaries with functional currencies different from EUR. The largest exposures result from changes in RON, USD, NOK and SEK denominated assets against the EUR.\n\nA foreign currency exposure arises from the Group's long-term net investment in its subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange translation differences relating to these net investments are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nBorealis has hedged part of its investment in a joint venture which has USD as its functional currency, by designating certain external loans in USD as hedges of the Group's investments in its foreign operations. The hedged risk in the net investment hedge is the risk of a weakening USD against the EUR that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the Group's net investment in the joint venture in USD. The EUR/USD impact on the measurement of the loans is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nTo assess hedge effectiveness, the Group determines the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item by comparing changes in the carrying amount of the debt, that is attributable to a change in the spot rate, with changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movements in the spot rate (the dollar-offset method). The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of",

        "page_content": "the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. Hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the amount of the investment in the foreign joint venture becomes lower than the amount of the borrowing.\n\n## Interest rate management\n\nTo facilitate management of interest rate risk, OMV's liabilities are analyzed in terms of fixed and floating rate borrowings, currencies and maturities. Appropriate ratios for the various categories are established and where necessary, derivative instruments are used to hedge fluctuations outside predetermined ranges.\n\nInterest rate swaps can be used to convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and vice versa. In the year 2022 the impact of interest rate swaps has not been material (2021: no material impact).\n\nThe hedge ineffectiveness and recycling of interest rate swaps are both shown in line item 'interest expenses' in OMV's Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR Reform)\n\nThe Group continuously evaluates contractual terms in respect of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition exposures. Where necessary, agreements will be amended to provide for alternative benchmark rates, which will be in accordance with Loan Market Association (LMA) standard at the time, to apply in relation to the affected currencies. Where applicable, the Group will transition USD LIBOR agreements during the first half of 2023.\n\nAs per end of December 31, 2022, for the EUR 1 bn (2021: EUR 1 bn) multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) a drawdown waiver is in place for currencies where IBOR rates were discontinued as a Screen Rate from December 31, 2021 (CHF, GBP, JPY). The RCF drawdown waiver will cease to have effect if the Facility is amended to provide for alternative benchmark rates, which will be in accordance with LMA standard at a time.\n\nIn addition, a JPY loan tranche of EUR 36 mn (2021: EUR 38 mn) has been successfully transitioned to Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR).\n\nThe Group considers that it is, in principle, exposed to uncertainties resulting from the interest rate benchmark reform in respect of its hedges of (3 month) USD LIBOR interest risks related to the existence of two outstanding USD interest rate swaps, with a nominal amount of EUR 103 mn (2021: EUR 97 mn) in total and a cross currency interest rate swap of EUR 36 mn (2021: EUR 38 mn). Their hedging period spans beyond 2022 when uncertainties about the existence of the USD LIBOR rates arise. OMV Group expects that the hedging instrument and the hedged risk of the hedged item will not change as a result of the reform. However, any hedge ineffectiveness would be accounted for in the income statement.\n\n## Impact of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\n| In EUR mn                                                                        | Benchmark               | Carrying Value  (notional amount for derivatives)   | Carrying Value  (notional amount for derivatives)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                  |                         | 2022                                                | 2021                                                |\n| Non-derivative financial assets                                                  |                         |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Loan receivable                                                                  | USD LIBOR               | 657                                                 | 987                                                 |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                             |                         |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Loan liabilities                                                                 | USD LIBOR               | 190                                                 | 189                                                 |\n| Loan liabilities 1                                                               | JPY LIBOR               | 36                                                  | 38                                                  |\n| Derivatives                                                                      |                         |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Interest rate swap (designated in a hedge relationship)                          | USD LIBOR               | 47                                                  | 44                                                  |\n| Interest rate swap (designated in a hedge relationship)                          | USD LIBOR               | 56                                                  | 53                                                  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swap (valued at fair value through  profit or loss) | JPY LIBOR  to USD LIBOR | 36                                                  | 38                                                  |\n\n- 1 JPY LIBOR has been successfully transitioned to Tokyo Over-night Average Rate (TONAR).",

The sensitivity of OMV Group's overall earnings differs from the sensitivity shown below, since the contracts concluded are used to hedge operational exposures.\n\nThe effect of market price fluctuations on the income statement or other comprehensive income depends on the type of derivative used and on whether hedge accounting is applied. Market price sensitivity for derivatives to which cash flow hedge accounting is applied is shown in the sensitivity table for other comprehensive income. Sensitivity to market price fluctuations for all other open derivatives is shown in the sensitivity tables for profit before tax.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for open commodity derivatives affecting profit before tax\n\n|                                                             | In EUR mn          | In EUR mn           | In EUR mn          | In EUR mn           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                             | 2022               | 2022                | 2021               | 2021                |\n|                                                             | Market price  +10% | Market price  (10)% | Market price  +10% | Market price  (10)% |\n| Oil incl. oil products                                      | 4                  | (4)                 | (25)               | 25                  |\n| Oil incl. oil products - designated in a hedge relationship | 14                 | (14)                | -                  | -                   |\n| Gas                                                         | 10                 | (10)                | (2)                | 2                   |\n| Power                                                       | 13                 | (13)                | (43)               | 43                  |\n| Other 2                                                     | 43                 | (43)                | 65                 | (65)                |\n| Total                                                       | 83                 | (83)                | (4)                | 5                   |\n\n- 1 Includes hedging instruments designated in a fair value hedge relationship related to product swaps with national stockholding companies in Germany and Slovakia.

Currently the effects of changes in interest rates are not considered to be a material risk.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nThe main counterparty credit risks are assessed and monitored at Group and Segment level using predetermined criteria and limits for all counterparties, banks and security providers. On the basis of a risk assessment, counterparties, banks and security providers are assigned a credit limit, an internal risk class and a specific limit validity. The risk assessments are reviewed at least annually or on an ad-hoc basis. The credit risk processes are governed by guidelines at OMV Group level stipulating the group-wide minimum requirements. The main counterparties with contracts involving derivative financial instruments have investment grade credit ratings. OMV uses commercial trade insurance for parts of its receivables in some business areas to mitigate credit risk. Based on the high economic uncertainty resulting from current geopolitical situation, special attention is paid to early warning signals like changes in payment behavior.\n\nCredit risk is the risk that OMV Group's counterparties will not meet their obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\nCredit risk exists in relation to the financial guarantee issued by Borealis to Bayport Polymers LLC, which is accounted for using the equity method, where the maximum outstanding exposure for Borealis amounts to EUR 623 mn (2021: nil). For further details refer to chapter 'Liquidity Risk'.\n\nThe guarantee terminates earliest upon payment and/or termination of the obligation in 2027 and 2032, respectively and could be called at any time. Generally, a payment under the guarantee agreement is triggered by the non-performance by the guaranteed party of the obligation covered by the guarantee. Therefore, a financial liability initially measured at fair value was recognized.\n\nThe Group is exposed to additional credit risks arising from credit exposures with customer accounts receivables (see Note 18 - Financial assets), from its operating activities as well as from its financial activities such as financial investments, including deposits with banks and financial institutions (see Note 26 - Statement of cash flows), foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments (see Note 18 - Financial assets).",

        "page_content": "## 32  Share based payments\n\n## Long Term Incentive (LTI) plans\n\nLTI plans with similar conditions are granted annually to the Executive Board and selected senior managers in the Group. At vesting date, shares will be granted to the participants. The number of shares is determined depending on the achievement of defined performance criteria. The defined performance criteria may not be amended during the performance period of the LTI plans. However - in order to maintain the incentivizing character of the program - the Remuneration Committee will have discretion (until LTI Plan 2020 for the Executive Board) to adjust the threshold/ target/ maximum levels of the free cash flow, in case of material changes in external factors such as oil and gas prices. The adjustment is possible in both directions and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Executive Board has the discretion to adjust the thresholds/ targets/ maximum levels of the free cash flow for Senior Managers accordingly. Disbursement is made in cash or in shares. From 2022 onwards OMV Petrom LTIP payment is made in shares only. Executive Board members and senior managers as active participants of the plans are required to build up an appropriate volume of shares and to hold those shares until retirement or departure from the company. For senior managers, if the LTIP eligibility lapses, but they are still in an active employment with the company, the shareholding requirement expires when the last LTIP is paid out. The\n\nshareholding requirement is defined as a percentage of the annual gross base salary, for the Executive Board, and as a percentage of the respective Target Long Term Incentive for the senior managers. Executive Board members have to fulfill the shareholding requirement within five years after the initial respective appointment. Until fulfillment of the shareholding requirement, the disbursement is in form of shares whilst thereafter the plan participants can decide between cash or share settlement. As long as the shareholding requirements are not fulfilled the granted shares after deduction of taxes are transferred to a trustee deposit, managed by the Company.\n\nFor share-based payments the grant date fair values are spread as expenses over the three years performance period with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. In case of assumed cash-settlements a provision is made for the expected future costs of the LTI plans at statement of financial position date based on fair values.\n\nIn 2021 Borealis introduced a LTI plan, which is harmonized with the above described LTI Plan. The shareholding requirement is only applicable to the Executive Board members of Borealis and not to senior managers.",

The holding period of the Equity Deferral is three years from vesting. The plan also seeks to prevent inadequate risk-taking.\n\nThe Annual Bonus is capped at 180% of the target Annual Bonus. A minimum of one third of the Annual Bonus is granted in shares. The determined bonus achievement is settled per March 31 following the period end whereby at the statement of financial position date the target achievements and the share price is estimated (the latter on basis of market quotes).\n\nGiven the volatility of commodity prices and market conditions inherent to the industry, the variable remuneration plans give the Remuneration Committee the authority (in line with general practices in the Oil and Gas industry) to adjust the threshold, target, and maximum levels based on actual oil/gas prices and EUR/USD exchange rates compared with assumptions at the time the targets were set. Adjustments are applied in both directions. They are determined by the Remuneration Committee and published in the Remuneration Report. The granted shares after deduction of taxes are transferred to a trustee deposit, managed by the Company, to be held for three years.\n\nIn 2022 expenses amounting to EUR 3 mn were recorded with a corresponding increase in equity (2021: EUR 3 mn).",

Transitional LTIP allowances for 2021 and 2022 are\n\nmeasuring similar KPI's as the three year plan for that specific year only and are settled in cash.\n\nExpenses related to all share based payment transactions are summarized in the below table.\n\n| Expenses related to share based payment transactions 1       |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| In EUR mn                                                    |      |      |\n|                                                              | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Cash settled                                                 | 15   | 28   |\n| Equity settled                                               | 7    | 10   |\n| Total expenses arising from share based payment transactions | 22   | 38   |\n\n- 1 Excluding incidental wage costs",

On April 19, 2022, Bayport Polymers LLC, which is accounted for using the equity method, partially repaid the loan towards the Group in the amount of EUR 602 mn. The repayment was financed from the two tranches of senior notes in the amount of EUR 324 mn and EUR 278 mn, which mature in 2027 and 2032 respectively. Senior notes issued by Bayport Polymers LLC are guaranteed by Borealis AG and therefore a financial liability in the amount of EUR 28 mn was recognized for the financial guarantee. For more details see Note 28 - Risk management, section 'Credit risk management'. The undrawn financing commitments provided to Bayport Polymers LLC amounted to EUR 46 mn as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 251 mn).\n\nA further decrease in the position loan receivables was mainly related to debt conversion into newly issued shares of Renasci N.V. in 2022. At year end 2021, the Group had further financing commitments to grant a convertible loan towards Renasci N.V. amounting to EUR 12 mn. Due to the debt conversion the total amount was completely drawn in 2022. For more details see Note 16 - Equity-accounted investments.\n\nFurthermore, a capital contribution amounting to EUR 408 mn was paid to Borouge 4 LLC in 2022.\n\nAt the reporting date, financing commitments towards Kilpilahden Voimalaitos Oy amounted to EUR 10 mn (December 31, 2021: EUR 16 mn). The entitlements are dependent on the fulfilment of specific events, as defined in the underlying contracts.\n\nOther non-financial liabilities in 2022 towards Erd\u00f6lLagergesellschaft m.b.H. refer to product swaps. The contract liabilities towards Erd\u00f6l-Lagergesellschaft m.b.H. are related to a long-term contract for rendering of services.\n\n## Government-related entities\n\nBased on the OMV ownership structure, the Republic of Austria has an indirect relationship with OMV via \u00d6BAG and is therefore, together with companies under the control of the Republic of Austria, considered a related party. OMV has transactions at arm's length in the normal course of business mainly with \u00d6sterreichische Post Aktiengesellschaft, VERBUND AG, \u00d6sterreichische Bundesbahnen-Holding Aktiengesellschaft, Bundesbeschaffung GmbH and their subsidiaries.\n\nIn July 2022, the strategic energy cooperation between OMV and VERBUND has commissioned the expansion",

A large number of other OMV employees also benefit from these two forms of insurance, and the insurers levy lump-sum premiums, which are not specifically attributed to the Board members.\n\n## 36  Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nOMV is selling trade receivables in a securitization program to Carnuntum DAC, based in Dublin, Ireland. In 2022, OMV transferred trade receivables amounting to EUR 5,746 mn to Carnuntum DAC (2021: EUR 4,573 mn).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, OMV held seller participa-\n\ntion notes amounting to EUR 168 mn (2021: EUR 95 mn) and complementary notes amounting to EUR 105 mn (2021: EUR 89 mn) in Carnuntum DAC shown in other financial assets. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure to loss from the securitization program was EUR 196 mn (2021: EUR 110 mn).\n\nSee Note 32 - Shared based payments - for details on Long Term Incentive Plans and Equity Deferral.\n\nIn 2022, remuneration expenses for the Supervisory Board amounted to EUR 1.1 mn (2021: EUR 0.6 mn).\n\nThe seller participation notes are senior to a loss reserve and a third party investor participation. The complementary notes are senior to seller participation notes and are of the same seniority as the senior notes issued by the program. The risk retained by OMV Group is insignificant and therefore the trade receivables sold are derecognized in their entirety. The receivables are sold at their nominal amount less a discount. The discount was recognized in profit or loss and amounted in total to EUR 37 mn in 2022 (2021: EUR 29 mn). Interest income on the notes held in Carnuntum DAC amounted to EUR 5 mn in 2022 (2021: EUR 2 mn). In addition, OMV received a service fee for the debtor management services provided for the receivables sold.",

        "page_content": "## 37  Subsequent events\n\nAs of January 1, 2023 the Group introduced a new corporate structure, designed to fully enable the delivery of Strategy 2030. Following the reorganization and starting from Q1/23, the Group will report on the following business segments: Chemicals & Materials, Fuels & Feedstock (former Refining & Marketing) and Energy (former Exploration & Production). As part of the introduction of the new corporate structure, Gas & Power Eastern Europe, which includes Supply, Marketing and Trading of gas in Romania and Turkey and one gasfired power plant in Romania, was transferred from Fuels & Feedstock to Energy business segment. The internal reporting and the relevant information provided to the chief operating decision maker in order to assess performance and allocate resources have been updated to reflect the new organizational structure. Comparative information for 2022 has been adjusted retrospectively and will be published together with the Q1/23 report.\n\nOn January 2, 2023, the sale of Borealis' shares in Rosier SA to YILDIRIM Group's YILFERT BENELUX B.V. has been completed. Following the completion of the sale, Borealis no longer holds any shares in Rosier SA.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, Borealis has further increased its stake in Renasci N.V. (Renasci) from 27.42% to 50.01%, signaling ongoing confidence in the potential of Renasci's patented SCP concept to drive the circular transformation. The stake increase was reached through a capital increase of EUR 5 mn and the acquisition of 35,719 shares for EUR 10.5 mn. Following this\n\ntransaction, Renasci will become a fully consolidated subsidiary in 2023 (2022: at-equity accounted).\n\nOn February 3, 2023 Borouge 4 LLC as the borrower and Borealis AG as lender, entered into a shareholder loan agreement (SHL) in the amount of USD 1,068 mn to part finance the Borouge 4 CAPEX requirements of Borouge 4 LLC. The SHL is structured as a facility with a 5 year tenor. Borealis retains the right to accelerate the prepayment of the outstanding amounts at the point of reintegration.\n\nOn February 27, 2023, the Executive Board of OMV has decided to explore the possibilities of selling the E&P assets in the Asia-Pacific region and to initiate the related sales process for the potential divestment of its 50% stake in the issued share capital of SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia and 100% of the shares in OMV New Zealand Limited. A potential divestment aims at optimizing the E&P portfolio in line with the OMV Strategy 2030.\n\nAs part of the sales process, OMV, in coordination with competent regulators and governmental authorities, will invite potentially interested parties, in a first step, to submit expressions of interest and, in a second step, to submit binding offers. The sales process is expected to take place over the next months. A potential sale is still subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board of OMV and competent governmental authorities.",

Proved oil and gas reserves were estimated based on a 12-month average price, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.\n\nProved developed reserves are those proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing\n\nwells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the costs of the required equipment are relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate. It should be reasonably certain that the required future expenditure will be made to safeguard existing equipment within the current budget.\n\nProved undeveloped reserves are those proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion or substantial new investment is required in order to safeguard or replace ageing facilities.",

Neither the effects of future pricing changes nor expected changes in technology and operating practices are considered.\n\nFuture cash inflows represent the revenues received from production volumes, including cushion gas held in storage reservoirs, assuming that the future production is sold at prices used in estimating year-end quantities of proved reserves (12 months average price). Future production costs include the estimated expenditures for production of the proved reserves plus any production taxes without consideration of future inflation. Future",

Future development costs include the estimated costs of development drilling and installation of production facilities. For all three categories year-end costs without consideration of inflation are assumed. Future income tax payments are calculated on the basis of the income tax rate applicable in each of the countries in which the Group operates. The present cash value results from\n\nthe discounting of the future net cash flow at a discount rate of 10% per year. The standardized measure does not purport to be an estimate of the fair value of the Group's proven reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, amongst many other factors, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs as well as a discount factor representative of the risks inherent in the production of oil and gas.\n\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n\n| In EUR mn                                                  | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                            | Romania  and Black  Sea                         | Austria                                         |                                                 | Russia  North Sea                               | Middle  East and  Africa                        | New  Zealand  and  Australia                    | Malaysia                                        | Total                                           |\n|                                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            | 2022                                            |\n| Subsidiaries                                               |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Future cash inflows                                        | 29,864                                          | 7,435                                           | -

        "page_content": "## Consolidated Report on the Payments Made to Governments\n\n## Section 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nSection 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) requires that large undertakings and public interest entities that are active in the extractive industry or logging of primary forests prepare the following consolidated report on payments to governments. This section implements Chapter 10 of the EU Accounting Directive (2013/34/EU). The 'Basis of preparation' paragraph provides information to the reader about the contents of the report. This also includes information on the type of payment for which disclosure is required and how OMV has implemented the regulations in the preparation of the report.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\n## Reporting entities\n\nUnder the requirements of the regulation, OMV Aktiengesellschaft is required to prepare a consolidated report covering payments made to governments for each financial year in relation to extractive activities by itself and any subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidated Group financial statements.\n\n## Activities within the scope of the report\n\nPayments made by the OMV Group (hereafter OMV) to governments that arose from exploration, prospection, discovery, development, and extraction of minerals, oils, and natural gas deposits or other materials within extractive activities are presented in this report.\n\n## Government\n\nA 'government' is defined as any national, regional, or local authority of a country or a department, agency, or undertaking that is controlled by that authority and includes national oil companies.\n\nIn cases where a state-owned entity engages in activities outside its designated home jurisdiction, it is not deemed to be a reportable governmental body for these purposes, and thus payments made to such an entity in these circumstances are not reportable.\n\n## Project definition\n\nThe regulation also requires payments to be reported on a 'project' basis as well as on a government and governmental body basis. A project is defined as the operational activities that are governed by a single contract, license, lease, concession, or similar legal agreement and form the basis for payment liabilities to the government. Where these agreements as per the aforementioned definition are substantially interconnected, these agreements are treated for the purpose of these regulations as a single project.\n\n'Substantially interconnected' is defined as a set of operationally and geographically integrated contracts, licenses, leases, concessions, or related agreements with substantially similar terms that are signed with a government, giving rise to payment liabilities. Such agreements can be governed by a single contract, joint venture agreement, production sharing agreement, or other overarching legal agreement.\n\nThere may be instances, for example, corporate income taxes, where it is not possible to attribute the payment to a single project and therefore these payments are shown at the country level.\n\n## Cash and payments in kind\n\nIn accordance with the regulation, payments have to be reported on a cash basis. This means that they are reported in the period in which they are paid and not in the period in which they are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\nRefunds are also reported in the period in which they are received and will either be offset against payments made in the period or be shown as negative amounts in the report.\n\nPayments in kind made to a government are converted to an equivalent cash value based on the most appropriate and relevant valuation method for each payment type. This can be at cost or market value and an explanation is provided in the report to help explain the valuation method. Where applicable, the related volumes are also included in the report.\n\n## Payment reporting methodology\n\nThe regulation requires that payments are to be reported where they are made to governments by OMV. It is required that the report reflect the substance of each transaction and activity. Based on these requirements, OMV has considered its reporting obligation as follows:",

The report will show both the value and volume of the government's production entitlement for the relevant period in barrels of oil equivalent (boe).\n\nThe government share of any production entitlement will also include any entitlements arising from an interest held by a state-owned entity as an investor in projects within its sovereign jurisdiction. Production entitlements arising from activities or interests outside a stateowned entity's sovereign jurisdiction are excluded.\n\n## Taxes\n\nTaxes levied on income, production, or profits of companies are reported. Refunds will be netted against payments and shown accordingly. Consumption taxes, personal income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and environmental taxes are not reported under the regulation. Although there is a tax group in place, the reported corporate income taxes for Austria relate entirely to the extractive activities in Austria of OMV's subsidiaries, with no amounts being reported relating to OMV's non-extractive activities in Austria.\n\n## Royalties\n\nRoyalties relating to the extraction of oil, gas, and minerals paid to a government are to be disclosed. Where royalties are paid in kind, the value and volume are reported.\n\n## Dividends\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, dividends are reported when paid to a government in lieu of production entitlements or royalties. Dividends that are paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder are not reported, as long as the dividends are paid on the same terms as that of other shareholders.\n\nFor the year that ended December 31, 2022, OMV had no such reportable dividend payments to a government.\n\n## Bonuses\n\nBonuses include signature, discovery, and production bonuses in each case to the extent paid in relation to the relevant activities.\n\n## Fees\n\nThese include license fees, rental fees, entry fees, and all other payments that are paid in consideration for access to the area where extractive activities are performed.\n\nThe report excludes fees paid to a government that are not specifically related to extractive activities or access to extractive resources. In addition, payments paid in return for services provided by a government are also excluded.\n\n## Infrastructure improvements\n\nThe report includes payments made by OMV for infrastructural improvements, such as the building of a road or bridge that serves the community, irrespective of whether OMV pays the amounts to non-government entities. These are reported in the period during which the infrastructure is made available for use by the local community.",

In volatile energy markets, measurement of the costs of petroleum products sold based on historical values (e.g., weighted average cost) can have distorting effects on reported results (Operating Result, net income, etc.). The amount disclosed as CCS effect represents the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a weighted average basis (adjusted for the change in valuation allowances related to net realizable value) and the charge based on the current cost of supply.
