In response to climate change challenges, the company is diversifying its energy sources, focusing on a balanced mix of economical thermal power and cleaner renewable energy to meet increasing demand. With an aggressive approach to expanding renewable energy, including green hydrogen, NTPC aims for nearly 45-50% of its capacity to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030, with the medium term target of 60 GW of renewable capacity by 2032. This is also reflected in NTPC's Energy Compact goals submitted to United Nations.\n\nDespite the drive towards renewables, NTPC acknowledges the importance of coal power plants for grid reliability, employment, and social inclusion. In response, we are transitioning to more efficient thermal technologies while exploring innovative energy solutions like biomass co-firing, green hydrogen production,  and  waste  recycling  based  on  circular economy  principles.  Concurrently,  NTPC  plans  to transform its thermal plants into chemical complexes for carbon capture and alternate fuel production, thus avoiding premature closures and reducing dependency on  imported  fossil  fuels.  Commitment  to  emission mitigation includes implementing flue gas desulphurization systems and De-NOx combustion modifications. Furthermore, NTPC is investigating the potential of nuclear power, including advanced and modular reactors, to further its sustainability goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We consistently strive to align our operations and business processes to effectively meet the expectations of  our  esteemed  stakeholders.  Our  strategies  are meticulously crafted to prioritize the needs of our diverse range  of  stakeholders,  encompassing  employees, communities, contractors, customers, and vendors. We actively engage with them with unwavering commitment and undertake materiality assessment to capture and integrate stakeholder issues into our decision-making and business strategy. We prioritize critical and recurring stakeholder concerns within the analysis, which further inform our actions and responses as outlined in the materiality section.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement 1\n\nWe, at NTPC, recognize that stakeholder engagement is  a  continuous  process,  encompassing  interactions\n\nat  various  management  levels  and  through  diverse communication channels. With a rich history spanning nearly  five  decades,  we  have  diligently  cultivated a  positive  and  constructive  relationship  with  our stakeholders, built upon the foundations of mutual trust, transparency,  ethics,  and  accountability.  Our  growth and achievements can be attributed in large part to the ongoing dialogue that we maintain with stakeholders, actively seeking  and  incorporating  their  valuable feedback on matters pertaining to our operations.\n\nTo effectively manage stakeholder relationships, NTPC has  implemented  a  comprehensive  and  structured stakeholder  management  process  across  verticals, functions, and establishments. This includes a 4 step systematic methodology that includes identifying key stakeholders, analyzing their perspectives and interests, and  mapping  and  prioritizing  their  needs,  leading ultimately  to  the  framing  of  engagement  strategy. Further details on this process can be found on the NTPC website at https://www.ntpc.co.in/sustainability/ stakeholder-management.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement Framework\n\nPrioritization\n\nEngagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Stakeholders\n\n| Stakeholder  Group   | Modes of Engagement   |                                               | Frequency of  Engagement   | Key Concerns                                   | Materiality  Topics Linkage   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Government of  India | \u00b7  \u00b7                  | Secretary level review Meetings with MoP,     | Quarterly Need based       | \u00b7  24x7 affordable power  to all \u00b7  Maximizing | All                           |\n| Government of  India | \u00b7  \u00b7                  | MNRE,  MoEFCC,  MoC, DAE, DPE,  Parliamentary |                            | infrastructure utilization                     | All                           |\n| Government of  India | \u00b7  \u00b7                  |                                               |                            | Social development                             | All                           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This exercise was helpful in prioritising the inputs received from relevant stakeholders, as described in the previous section (Stakeholder Engagement), and incorporating them into the decision-making process of NTPC. The material topics also provide further insights\n\ninto the challenges, risks, and opportunities that our company may face as described in the chapters on Risk and Governance, and Ethics and Vigilance. Our business sustainability depends on the effective management of material topics since it guides our strategic planning and management priorities towards creating long-term sustainable  value  for  our  stakeholders.

Additionally, reducing the burden on local resources  through  minimized  extraction  and  waste\n\ngeneration helps preserve the environment and promote sustainability.\n\nWe understand that ensuring fuel security is vital for maintaining the energy security of our nation, and hence NTPC constantly explores new sources of fuels while also engaging in long-term supply contracts to enable uninterrupted operation of its plants.\n\n## Coal Sourcing\n\nNTPC has established both long-term and short-term coal supply agreements with domestic companies and foreign suppliers. Specifically, long-term Fuel Supply Agreements  (FSAs)  are  in  effect  with  the  subsidiary coal companies of Coal India Ltd. (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company  Limited (SCCL) for Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 170.82 MMT and 13.74 MMT respectively as on 31 March, 2023.\n\nDuring  the  reporting  year,  we  also  received  21.8 MMT of coal from our own captive mines, while ACQ materialization for Financial Year 2022-23 was around 92%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, due to the allocation of gas to the City Gas Distribution (CGD) sector based on the MoP&NG guidelines, the supply of domestic gas (both APM and non-APM)  to  power  plants,  including  NTPC  stations within the Gas grid, has been discontinued since June 16, 2021. In addition to the above agreement, NTPC also  has  a  long-term  agreement  with  GAIL  for  the supply of 1.1 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter per Day (MMSCMD) of Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) on a firm basis, valid until December 2023.\n\nTo compensate for the shortfall in long-term domestic gas  and  RLNG  supply,  NTPC  procures  Spot  RLNG through limited tender from domestic suppliers and on a 'Single Offer' basis from Public Sector gas marketing companies. These Spot RLNG supplies are contracted on a 'Reasonable Endeavour' basis, without penalties for short supply or off-take by either party. Furthermore, since  March  2020,  NTPC  has  been  procuring  Spot RLNG on a commitment basis from domestic suppliers, subject  to  the  consent  of  the  beneficiary  DISCOMs (Distribution Companies). Adequate stock of liquid fuel is also maintained by NTPC to meet the requirements of the power grid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sourcing of Biomass for Co-Firing\n\nWe  are  India's first major  energy  company  to commercialize biomass co-firing in our coal-powered plants,  using  up  to  10%  agro-residue-based  biofuel alongside coal. The company is using these pellets, made out of stubble and husk, in its majority of the coalfired power plants across the country. This approach reduces  coal  usage,  mitigates  carbon  emissions, and  discourages  the  burning  of  crop  residue  while generating economic value from agricultural waste. Our innovative method leverages existing coal-based power plant  infrastructure  to  produce  renewable  energy, contributing to the renewable energy sector.\n\n## Biomass Sourcing (000'MT)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, mine operations began at the Chatti Bariatu mine in September 2022 and the Kerandari mine on 5 April 2023. Moreover, Financial Year 2022-23 witnessed the highest-ever coal dispatch of 21.96 MMT, showing a significant 48% growth from the previous financial year.\n\nIn Financial Year 2022-23, there has been significant progress in coal production from the Talaipalli Coal mine,  with  the  appointment  of  mining  agencies  in the South pit extension and West pit. However, there have  been  disputes  and  contractual  issues  with  the main MDO appointed in August 2020, which led to the termination  of  the  contract.  The  matter  is  currently undergoing  conciliation  before  CCIE-1.  Nevertheless, NTPC has taken steps to appoint a new MDO for the East Pit of Talaipalli to ramp up coal production.\n\nDue to the contractual and legal issues with the MDO, the commercial operation of the mine could not be initiated within  two  years,  and  coal  production  and  dispatch remained  below  100%  of  the  ATQ  (annual  targeted quantity) stipulated in the original approved mining plan. Declaring  COD  (Commercial  Operation  Date)  during this period could have resulted in an under-recovery of fixed costs as per CERC regulations. However, with the forthcoming appointment of the MDO for the East Pit, we envision sustainable growth in coal production from Financial Year 2023-24 onwards.

Our  comprehensive  EIA  studies  serve as  the  foundation  for  developing  and  implementing Environmental  Management  Plans  across  all  our stations. Our environmental policy centers around the efficient utilization of natural resources, waste reduction through  recycling  and  reusing,  adoption  of  cutting-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nedge technologies, and improving the performance of older units for increased efficiency ensuring minimum impact on the environment. We continuously enhance our environmental performance by implementing viable engineering  solutions  and  complying  with  regulatory standards. NTPC stations hold ISO: 14001 certification 1 for effective  environmental  management  systems and  practices.  Additionally,  we  have  established  an environmental  grievance  mechanism  to  ensure  early resolution of the issues and the proper documentation of all concerns and complaints.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water & Effluent Management 2\n\nNTPC recognizes water as a vital resource for life and maintains a steadfast commitment to its sustainable utilization.  Through  vigilant  monitoring,  we  strive  to optimize water consumption using the 3R principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle.\n\nAlmost all our thermal power plants employ a closedcycle  cooling  system  with  cooling  towers  to  ensure there is minimum impact on environment. Through the latest technology adoption and regular maintenance, we  ensure  there  is  minimal  water  loss  primarily through evaporation, drift, and blowdown in the same. To  enhance  water  efficiency,  we  are  increasing  the cycles  of  concentration  (COC)  and  reusing  high-TDS blowdown water in other processes. Furthermore, we are  actively  implementing  zero  liquid  discharge  (ZLD) across  all  stations,  our  nineteen  power  generating stations have already adopted this practice and the rest are in advanced stages of implementation. Our current water discharges, including treated effluents and runoff, comply with stipulated norms and conditions, ensuring no significant impact on water bodies or related habitats.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEfforts to enhance the reuse and recycling of effluents have resulted in reduced freshwater withdrawal needs over  time.  Nonetheless,  the  growing  integration  of renewable energy sources in the power grid is causing thermal  units  to  operate  at  significantly  lower  plant load  factors  (PLFs),  consequently  raising  per-unit water consumption. Furthermore, the implementation of wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems across all  stations  presents  a  challenge  in  reducing  water consumption.  However,  due  to  our  various  efforts towards water conservation, we have managed to bring our specific water consumption at our thermal units below prescribed norms of 3 litre/kWh.",

Nevertheless, a comparative study on this matter is still pending.\n\n## Afforestation\n\nNTPC has proactively engaged in extensive afforestation endeavors to combat the impact of greenhouse gases, bolstering India's green cover and oxygen reserves while serving as a vital carbon sink for emissions stemming from power stations and other origins. Complementing these initiatives, NTPC has set up nurseries within its facilities and townships to facilitate the cultivation of seeds  and  seedlings,  supporting  internal  plantation and  horticulture  operations.  This  collaborative  effort with  State  Forest  Departments,  formalized  through MOUs, effectively delineates crucial aspects such as the plantation timeline, maintenance duration, funding arrangements, and survival targets.\n\nNTPC has implemented Guidelines for Afforestation, serving as the basis for afforestation across its projects. The plantation activities can be categorized into the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Development  of  green  belts  around  the  plants : These green belts reduce pollution by capturing particulates from plant operations, minimize noise levels,  act  as  carbon  sinks,  lower  surrounding temperatures,  and  enhance  atmospheric  oxygen content. Green belts have been established in all operational NTPC stations, while new stations are creating green belts.\n- \u00b7 Plantation by individual stations : NTPC plants do massive afforestation each year and add around 1 million trees each year.\n- \u00b7 Distribution of fruit-bearing trees to farmers and township residents : NTPC provides small saplings of  fruit-bearing,  flower,  and  vegetable  plants to  local  farmers  and  township  residents.  This initiative encourages plantation on individual land holdings, with the trees supplied free of cost. NTPC also promotes tree planting by its employees and their dependents during various occasions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall, NTPC has successfully planted more than 38 million trees since its inception.\n\n## Environment Training 20\n\nWe conduct capacity-building programs on environmental subjects for various stakeholders, including  employees,  the  contract  workforce,  and communities,  aiming  to  enhance  knowledge  and awareness.  These  programs  cover  topics  such  as waste  management,  water  conservation,  biodiversity protection, and more.\n\n## No. of Beneficiaries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll NTPC  stations  have  dedicated  environmental cells, with 33 stations certified for ISO 14001. Regular inspections,  audits,  and  compliance  assessments  of the Environment Management Systems are conducted by  regulatory  agencies,  NGOs,  and  ISO  certification bodies, both internally and externally. NTPC ensures full adherence to environmental laws and regulations mandated by statutory agencies, demonstrating its unwavering commitment  to  achieving 100% compliance.  The  company  promptly  responds  to directives  from  regulators  by  implementing  feasible engineering solutions within specified timelines. To meet stringent environmental standards, NTPC undertakes renovation  and  modernization  (R&M)  of  pollution control technologies in older operating units, enabling the fulfillment of all legal requirements through R&M activities.",

Our adherence to international standards and guidelines, such  as  the  United  Nations  Universal  Declaration of  Human  Rights,  the  10  (UN)  Global  Compact\n\n7\n\nGRI 402-1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprinciples,  and  the  International  Labor  Organization Core Conventions, serves as a foundation for ethical business practices. Respecting the rights of employees, including their freedom of association, is essential to fostering a positive work environment. NTPC recognizes the freedom of workmen (non-executive) employees to associate themselves with various unions, facilitating collective bargaining agreements. 5\n\nThere is no operational entity where manpower and suppliers faces risk related to  the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour and forced or compulsory labor. 6\n\nTo ensure smooth  transitions during significant operational changes like location transfers, terminations, or resignations, a minimum notice period ranging from 4 to 12 weeks is required. 7\n\nCreating  a  safe  workplace,  particularly  for  women, is  crucial  for  maintaining  a  secure  and  inclusive culture. We establish Internal Complaints Committees at  operational  locations  to  handle  complaints  of sexual  harassment,  promoting  a  proactive  approach to  addressing  and  preventing  such  issues.  These committees are reconstituted every three years, and prompt resolutions are provided. During the reporting period, six cases of sexual harassment were reported and resolved promptly, with only one pending cases as of now. We have conducted over 100 workshops and programs to raise awareness and prevent sexual harassment.\n\nEach  NTPC  project  has  its  own  Grievance  Redressal Mechanism to address employee grievances promptly. We  use  various  forums,  such  as  communication meetings  and  organizational  climate  surveys,  to capture and address these concerns. NTPC complies with statutory and regulatory requirements concerning payment  of  wages  and  benefits.  We  ensure  that employees' rights are not violated and provide statutory benefits like Provident Fund and medical facilities.",

Our focus is to reduce dependency on coal and gas through the infusion of renewable power. However, given the current emphasis on renewable energy generation in the country, there is a possibility of a reduction in scheduled generation\n\n## Day Ahead Market (DAM)\n\n## Real Time Market (RTM)\n\nPrior consent from DISCOMs is required for selling URS power in the Day Ahead Market (DAM), which operates from 10:00 to 12:00 Hrs of the previous day. This market accounts for 75%-80% of power trading volume in Power Exchanges.\n\nRTM has been implemented since 01 June 2020, allowing generating stations to sell surplus power and  enabling  DISCOMs  to  buy  power  to  meet contingency  needs.  It  consists  of  48  half-hourly auctions during the delivery date, facilitating pricesensitive bidding for generators and DISCOMs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Marketing of the Project\n\nNTPC's thermal projects are regional power projects supplying electricity to specific states. The Commercial Function analyzes the demand and supply in the region and markets the power from the new project. NTPC approaches state power distribution utilities to determine their power requisitions. Based on this, viability of the project is assessed. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are signed with willing utilities, and consent is sought from beneficiaries. The Ministry of Power allocates power to customers, including DISCOMs.\n\n## Regulatory Interface\n\nNTPC,  as  a  Central  Generating  Utility,  falls  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Central Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (CERC).  CERC  determines  tariffs  for  NTPC stations based on regulations. NTPC actively engages with CERC by submitting data, providing comments, and participating in hearings. The Commercial Function formulates  NTPC's  views  on  commercial  aspects  of  policy  documents  and guidelines from the Central Electricity Authority and Ministry of Power.\n\n## Pricing of Electricity\n\nCERC determines tariffs for NTPC's thermal stations as per regulations. Solar tariffs are discovered through competitive bidding. Wind and small hydro tariffs follow CERC's generic tariff. The Commercial Function prepares and files petitions with CERC, presents cases, and responds to queries.\n\n## Billing and Realization\n\nCommercial Function raises monthly bills based on the Regional Energy Account issued  by  the  Regional  Power  Committee.  Billing  is  done  according  to  the beneficiaries'  energy  schedule  and  the  tariff  of  the  respective  stations.  Timely bill realization is ensured, and early payment is incentivized through the Rebate Scheme. NTPC interacts with distribution utilities and state governments for timely payments.\n\nfrom coal/gas plants, driven by the aggressive addition of  renewable  capacity,  and  policy  mandates  like Renewable Purchase Obligations. To optimize resource utilization, surplus power that is not requisitioned needs to  be  redirected.  The  Commercial  Function  ensures that  this  surplus  power  is  made  available  to  other consumers in need through the Power Exchanges or bilateral agreements. It is sold on both the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM) platforms. In the Financial Year 2022-23, around 639 million units of power were sold in the DAM and RTM in Power Exchanges.\n\n<!-- image -->",

International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made mild growth projections for most of the economies across the world, however, India has fared better than most of the emerging and developing economies, IMF expects India to grow by 6.1% in the financial year 2023-24 and also by an average rate of 6.1% over the next five years.\n\nBased  on  the  Indices  of  Industrial  Production  (IIP), electricity sector has shown a growth of 8.9% over the last  fiscal. The  growth  is  also  higher  when  compared to IIP for mining and manufacturing sectors during the same period (5.8% and 4.5% respectively).\n\nFinancial year 2022-23 has seen India's power sector achieving new milestones and meeting the aspirations of a rapidly growing nation. While peak demand touched a new high of ~ 216 GW, gross generation crossed 1600 BUs for the first time. With the addition of more than 15 GW of RE capacity during the year, the installed RE capacity(including  large  Hydro)  crossed  40%  of  the total installed capacity. Amidst all these developments, universal  access  to  affordable  power  remains  the primary goal for the Power sector.\n\nHowever, to meet this goal, the biggest challenge is restoration  of  the  financial  health  of  the  DISCOMs across the country. In this direction, the implementation of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) launched by Government of India (GOI) in the financial year 2021-22 has gathered pace and its positive impact can be seen with the reduction of the ACS-ARR gap. However, further efforts are required for modernisation of  the  distribution  sector  through  rapid  adoption  of smart grid technologies and digitalization of processes & customer interface. Additionally, ever increasing share of renewable energy into the grid poses a challenge for grid stability. To meet these challenges and move ahead with the decarbonization of the economy, Government of  India  and  Electricity  Regulator  has  taken  several initiatives  in  the  financial  year  2022-23,  key  among them are:\n\n## Power Sector Reforms\n\n- \uf0a7 Indian Electricity Grid Code 2023\n- \uf0a7 General Network Access Regulations 2022\n- \uf0a7 Energy  Conservation  Act  (Amendment)  2022, (Introduction of Carbon Markets),\n- \uf0a7 Electricity  (Late  Payment  Surcharge  and  Related Matters) Rules, 2022\n\n## Renewable Energy Promotion\n\nWith a commitment to increase non-fossil fuel-based energy  capacity  to  500  GW  by  2030,  the  following initiatives  have  been  taken  to  promote  RE  capacity addition:\n\n- \uf0a7 Green Energy Open Access Rules\n- \uf0a7 National Green Hydrogen Mission\n- \uf0a7 Revised Renewable Purchase Obligation trajectory including energy storage obligations\n- \uf0a7 Introduction of Renewable Generation Obligation\n- \uf0a7 Bidding  Guidelines  for  Battery  Energy  Storage System\n- \uf0a7 Performance  Link  Incentive  Tranche-II  for  Solar Manufacturing\n- \uf0a7 Guidelines for Promotion of Pump storage projects\n- \uf0a7 Waiver of ISTS charges for RE and allied activities\n- \uf0a7 CEA (Flexible Operation of TPP) Regulations, 2023\n- \uf0a7 Electricity (Amendment) Rules, 2022 for creation of central pool of ISTS RE sources\n- \uf0a7 Scheme  for  flexibility in generation through bundling with RE\n\n## INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe power sector is a key enabler of India's economic growth. Electricity contributes ~ 21% to the final energy consumption of India. The sector with its three pillars: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution, is crucial to India's infrastructure and economic growth. The global stature of the Indian Power Sector is depicted well by its positioning in terms of generation capacity. India is ranked 3 rd in the World in terms of electricity generation, 4 th in  installed  renewable  energy  capacity,  5 th and  6 th\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annexure - I to Directors' Report",

It is  still  well  below  50%  of  the  global  average, providing enough room for growth. The total electricity requirement  in  India  increased  from  1380  BUs  in  the financial  year  2021-22  to  1512  BUs  in  the  financial year2022-23 growing by ~ 10%.\n\nMajor  end-users  of  power  are  broadly  classified  into 6 categories: Agricultural, Commercial,  Domestic, Industrial, Traction, and  others.  Their  shares  of electricity consumption, during the financial year 202122, were approximately 17.7%, 8.3%, 25.7%, 41.1%, 1.5% and 5.9%, respectively. During the financial year 202223, although absolute consumption of all the sectors has increased, the share of agriculture and domestic consumption in the total consumption has increased whereas for other sectors it has decreased slightly.\n\n## Transmission\n\nThe  total  inter-regional  transmission  capacity  of  the country has increased to 112250 MW as on 31 March 2023. This augmentation of the national grid is essential for supporting the higher injection of renewable energy into the grid for the transfer of power from RE-rich states to other states.\n\nFurther,  to  meet  the  power  evacuation  requirement of  500  GW  non-fossil  fuel-based  capacity  planned by  2030,  connectivity  of  RE  generators  to  the  load centres through Inter-State Transmission  System (ISTS), is essential. It is estimated that the length of the transmission  lines  and  sub-station  capacity  required under ISTS for integration of additional wind and solar capacity by 2030 will be 50890 Ckms and 433575 MVA respectively.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution is the key link in realizing the Government\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof  India's  vision  of  supplying  reliable  24x7  Power  for all. In this regard, the financial health of distribution companies is of prime importance, enabling them to efficiently discharge their functions and responsibilities. However, their poor financial health has remained a matter  of  concern. To  reverse  this  trend,  reduction  of AT&C losses and ACS (Average Cost of Supply) - ARR (Average Revenue Realization) gap are critical factors. With  these  intentions,  Revamped  Distribution  Sector Scheme (RDSS) has been launched to reinvigorate the DISCOMs. Important objectives of RDSS are:\n\n- \uf0a7 Reduction of AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 1215% by the financial year 2024-25.\n- \uf0a7 Reduction of ACS-ARR gap to zero by the financial year 2024-25.\n- \uf0a7 Improvement in the quality, reliability, and affordability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.\n\nThis results-linked scheme, launched in July 2021, has pushed the utilities and states to address performance gaps, and chart action plans to avail the benefits worth \u20b9300,000  crore.  The  outlay  includes  an  estimated Government Budgetary Support (GBS) of \u20b997,631 crore.\n\nThe Scheme is comprised of two components:\n\n- \uf0a7 Part-A: Financial support  for  Prepaid  Smart Metering,  System  Metering,  and  Up-gradation  of Distribution Infrastructure; and\n- \uf0a7 Part-B:  Training  and  capacity  building  and  other enabling and supporting activities.\n\nUnder this scheme Action Plans for 46 DISCOMs (28 States/UTs)  have  been  approved  where ~ 20.46  crore pre-paid smart consumer meters, ~ 54 Lakh smart DT meters and ~ 1.98 Lakh smart feeder meters have been sanctioned.\n\nThe  impact  of  these  initiatives  is  reflected  in  the finding  of  the  11 th Integrated  Rating  &  Ranking  of Power  Distribution  Utilities.  The  key  indicators  of  the improvement of DISCOMs performances are as below:\n\n- \uf0a7 In  the  financial  year  2021-22, performance of 39 DISCOMs have improvement over the last fiscal.\n- \uf0a7 While total  sectoral  debt  rose  24%  to  \u20b96.20  lakh crore till the financial year 2021-22, the pace of debt addition slowed considerably. Debt increased by  \u20b934,000  crore  in  the  financial  year  2021-22, versus \u20b985,500 crore in the financial year 2020-21.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The power distribution entities were recording  a  loss  of  79  paise/unit  in  the  financial year 2019-20, which reduced to 40 paise/unit in the financial year 2021-22.\n- \uf0a7 AT&C  losses  have  improved  to  16.5%  in  the financial  year  2021-22,  significantly  lower  than 21.5% in the financial year 2020-21.\n\n## Power Trading\n\nIn India, power is transacted largely through long-term Power  Purchase  Agreements  (PPA)  entered,  between Generating companies and the distribution utilities. A small portion is transacted through various short-term (contract  period<1  Year)  mechanisms.  This  includes Day  Ahead  Market  and  Real-Time  Market  (RTM), followed by bilateral contracts (through traders, termahead  contracts  on  power  exchanges,  and  directly between DISCOMs) and through Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM).\n\nAround 90% of the power generated in the country is transacted through the long-term PPA route while the remaining  power  is  transacted  through  short-term trading mechanisms.\n\n## KEY INITIATIVES/REFORMS & REGULATORY CHANGES IN THE POWER SECTOR\n\n## SECTORAL REFORMS\n\n## 1. Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022\n\nThe  Union  Power  Ministry  on  8  August  2022 introduced  Electricity  (Amendment)  Bill,  2022.It has been referred to the Standing Committee on Energy for a detailed examination.

Land acquisition challenges, conflicts over land use, and competition  for  limited  land  resources  can pose hurdles to the development of renewable energy projects.\n\nEfforts are made to obtain all statutory clearances and ensure land availability before the commencement of the projects. Timely tie up for power  evacuation  and  expediting  the  installation of associated transmission system is helping in mitigating the grid capacity constraints. Further, GOI has planned the enhancement of the transmission capacity to meet target of 500 GW non-fossil fuelbased capacity by 2030.\n\n## 2. Flexible operation of Thermal Units\n\nTo  integrate  variable  RE  into  the  grid,  coal-based power  plants  must  regulate  their  generation  to maintain  grid  balance.  Therefore,  the  influx  of more  RE  power  in  the  grid  would  require  many coal-based plants to operate at technical minimum capacity, frequent load fluctuations, and two-shift operations.  This  will  result  in  lower  efficiency  at partial load leading to a higher cost of generation. Other factors like the cost of balancing services, and  reduced  life  due  to  flexible  operation  of  the thermal plant would also adversely affect the cost of generation.\n\nMost  of  the  NTPC  plants  have  achieved  the ramping  rate  required  for  flexible  operation  and policy advocacy for compensating the additional cost due to flexible operation is also being taken up at various levels.\n\n## 3. Environmental Concerns\n\nThe  environmental  concerns  particularly  relating to coal-based thermal stations have emerged as a major challenge to the sector. To comply with new standards for  water  consumption,  PM,  SOx,  NOx, and mercury, thermal power plants need to install emission  control  equipment  like  FGD  (Flue  Gas Desulphurisation), and DSI (Dry Sorbent Injection) along  with  necessary  combustion  modifications and retrofitting of ESP (Electrostatic Precipitator). The  cost  of  retrofitting  appropriate  systems  to meet these norms will have an adverse impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non tariffs. Logistics and supply chain for sourcing the  consumables  and  disposing  of  the  waste generated  impose  additional  challenges.  Non fulfillment of Environmental norms may result in levy  of  environmental  compensation  as  per  the latest  MOEF&CC  notification  dated  5  September 2022. To meet the norms, FGD and DSI technology has  been  commissioned  at  8  Units  (2990  MW) and  under  erection  at  126  units  (59290  MW). Combustion Modification for NOx completed at 45 out of 50 units and R&M of ESP completed at 40 out of 50 units.\n\nFurther,  as  per  new  environment  norms,  all plants  must  achieve  100%  ash  utilization  within a  'compliance  period'  based  on  their  level  of Ash utilization.Various initiatives have been undertaken for the development of new products and processes for bulk Ash utilization and as a result novel technologies & products such as Geo Polymeric  (GPC)  Road,  Geo  polymeric  Pavers  & Tetrapod,  etc.  have  been  successfully  developed and implemented.\n\n## 4. Non-availability of Gas\n\nGOI  has  accorded  higher  priority  for  allocation of  domestic  gas  to  CGD  (City  Gas  Distribution) sector. Due to the diversion of allocated gas to the CGD sector as per MOP&NG guidelines, allocated domestic  gas  (APM/Non-APM)  supplies  to  your company became Nil w.e.f. 16 June 2021. Further, due  to  high  reserve  prices  and  onerous  terms  & conditions, the Power sector is not able to tie up new domestic gas from the KG basin. Gas stations are  dependent  upon  costlier  RLNG  for  declaring capacity/generation, however, the generation schedule on RLNG is not available on a sustained basis. Gas is procured from available sources and spot market as per the requirement.\n\n## 5. Coal Shortage\n\nThe unprecedented rise in power demand coupled with constraints in coal transportation and a steep rise in the price of imported coal may result in inadequate coal stock at thermal plants, pushing them below critical levels.\n\nHowever,  your  Company  is  making  all  efforts to secure  fuel  supply  through  existing  Fuel Supply  Agreements  (FSA),  increasing  captive coal production and tying up for additional fuel sources  domestically.  Import  of  coal  has  also been  undertaken  as  per  the  requirement  and  in alignment with Government guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The demand for power registered a growth of 9.6% in the financial  year  2022-23  due  to  the  post  pandemic economic  recovery  and  an  abnormally  hot  summer. Under these testing circumstances your Company has not only catered to this surge in demand, but also did it  more  efficiently.  This  is  reflected  in  the  generation touching ~ 400 BUs and average PLF of your Company's coal stations reaching 76%, way higher than the country average of 64%. In terms of market share your Company supplied  around  25%  of  the  Country's  power  demand while  having  around  17%  of  installed  capacity  thus maintaining its leadership position in power generation. This has been made possible with a diversified portfolio and an integrated supply chain from coal mining to power trading.\n\nThe  stature  of  your  Company  is  well  depicted  by  its worldwide  rankings  such  as  1 st Independent  Power Producer  (IPP)  in  the  PLATTS  IPP  and  Energy  Trader Rankings (2022), 16 th in Fortune India 500 Companies (2022) and 11 th largest among Indian Companies (485 th Globally) in Forbes Global 2000 Companies (2022).\n\nThe  focus  of  your  Company  is  to  fulfil  the  everincreasing  power  requirements  of  the  country,  critical for meeting the growth aspirations. While doing this, it is  of  cardinal  importance to be a major contributor in the energy transition fostering the achievement of net zero milestone.\n\nIn this regard, your Company has an ambitious plan to  reach  a  total  installed  capacity  of  130  GW  by 2032. In Renewable space, the target is to achieve 60 GW by  2032.  The  present  portfolio  of  RE  projects  is around 20 GW, out of which 3.2 GW has already been commissioned, while remaining is under various stages of development.\n\nFurther,  capacity  addition  is  planned  through  Ultra Mega  Renewable  Energy  Power  Projects  (UMREPPs), collaborating  with  other  companies,  partnering  with State  Governments  and  through  competitive  bids.  To focus on RE business, your Company has consolidated its RE portfolio in NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL).\n\nTo ensure the optimal utilization of the vast renewable capacity planned, energy storage solutions will be of vital importance. In this regard, it is planned to develop substantial storage capacity. In this regard, GOI has indicated power CPSEs for development of PSPs across\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  country,  under  this  PSPs  totalling  11.5  GW  have been indicated for your Company and we are taking up with State Governments for implementing these.\n\nConsidering the high level of variable RE infusion, it is important to provide base load support to the grid, to  ensure  grid  stability.  For  this  purpose,  a  thermal capacity  of  around  6GW  through  brown  field  projects is also under various phases of planning/development.\n\nFurther to foray into nuclear power sector, your Company is  collaborating  with  Nuclear  Power  Corporation  of India Limited (NPCIL). This will also help the country in meeting the net zero emission target by 2070.\n\nIt is also planned to foray into the Hydrogen ecosystem for production of Green Chemicals and Fuels (Methanol & Ammonia) supported by research & development and collaboration with OEM/OES, research institutes, etc.\n\nTo  expand  its  RE-C&I  (Commercial  and  Industrial) portfolio, your Company  has  also  entered  into agreements with various companies for supply of RERTC power.\n\nFurther, your Company envisages enhancing its current presence in consultancy services, power trading, and ancillary services and has targeted a 25% market share in ancillary services and storage by 2032 under its longterm plan.\n\nFuel security is of critical importance for the thermal portfolio; therefore,  your  Company's  focus  is  on increasing the captive coal production. Efforts are on to  acquire  new  coal  blocks  through  participation  in commercial auctioning by the Ministry of Coal.\n\n## Growth Outlook\n\nYour Company is looking for opportunities to expand and diversify its business in new areas both domestically and globally by working in close coordination with the Indian and global energy community.

The aforesaid circular of MCA further exempted listed Govt.

In  view  of  above,  as  per requirement of Regulation 17(10) of the SEBI (LODR), evaluation of Independent Director was not made by the Board of Directors.

On the basis of expert opinion since obtained, these transactions were granted ex-post facto approval by the Audit Committee in its meeting held on 28 th July 2023.\n\nIn  case of Related Party Transactions with Utility Powertech Limited ('UPL'), a Joint Venture, during the  financial  year,  contracts  totalling  \u20b9  2,041.26 crore were awarded for sourcing of manpower for plant operations & maintenance. These contracts were issued  as per in-principle approval accorded under  Power  Station  Operation  &  Maintenance Agreement for a period of five years i.e. an umbrella agreement  approved  by  the  Audit  Committee  in its meeting held on 22 nd March, 2021. However, individual transactions done under the aforesaid agreement during 2022-23 were not approved by the  Audit  Committee.  Further,  works  amounting to  \u20b9  647.62  crore  only  were  executed  during  the year against these contracts. The value of contract awarded to UPL was reduced subsequently to less than \u20b91,000 crore by foreclosing/change of scope of work in respect of some of the purchase orders during the financial year 2023-24.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  expert  opinion  since  obtained,  it has  been  opined  that  shareholders'  approval  is not required for the transactions with UPL in view of the subsequent reduction of the contract value as stated above, and that the Board of Directors is authorised to ratify those transactions which are not approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. Accordingly, the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 29 th July, 2023 had granted ex-post facto approval  for  those    Related  Party  Transactions which were not approved by the Audit Committee.

If Yes, then provide details.\n\nYes, we embrace our ethical duty to support the country's endeavors in reducing GHG emissions and mitigating climate change. We have adopted cleaner, more energy-efficient technologies to reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity. We're transitioning from sub-critical to supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology. NTPC is an early adopter of supercritical and ultra-supercritical boilers in India, saving ~2% fuel per unit of power and reducing emission intensity by 8% compared to conventional subcritical plants. It also increases efficiency by around 8%.\n\nIn  addition  to  this,  we  are  also  exploring  cleaner  energy  avenues  and  are  looking  to  increase  the  over  RE percentage in our energy mix. We are also working carbon sink development, and has planted 38 million trees so far, with the target of planting at least 1 million tree sapling annually.\n\n## 8.

Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nThe Company has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101-'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16-'Property, plant and equipment'& Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Company's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 1.1.   Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.\n\nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/ assessments.\n\nItems of spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Company to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted from the directly attributable cost considered as part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 1.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Company uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 1.3.  Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 1.4.  De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 1.5.  Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation/amortization is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration, power plants not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations, investment properties and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n| a)   | Kutcha roads                                                                                                                                                          | 2 years    |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| b)   | Enabling works                                                                                                                                                        |            |\n|      | -  residential buildings                                                                                                                                              | 15 years   |\n|      | -  internal electrification of residential buildings                                                                                                                  | 10 years   |\n|      | -  non-residential buildings including their internal electrification, water supply, sewerage  & drainage works, railway sidings, aerodromes, helipads and airstrips. | 5 years    |\n| c)   | Personal computers & laptops including peripherals.                                                                                                                   | 3 years    |\n| d)   | Photocopiers, fax machines, water coolers and refrigerators.                                                                                                          | 5 years    |\n| e)   | Temporary erections including wooden structures.                                                                                                                      | 1 year     |\n| f)   | Telephone exchange.                                                                                                                                                   | 15 years   |\n| g)   | Wireless systems, VSAT equipment, display devices viz. projectors, screens, CCTV, audio  video conferencing systems and other communication equipment.                | 6 years    |\n| h)   | Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings.                                                                                                                     | 2-7 years  |\n| i)   | Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations.                                                                                            | 25 years   |\n| j)   | Hospital equipment                                                                                                                                                    | 5-10 years |\n| k)   | Furniture and Fixture                                                                                                                                                 | 5-15 years |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn intangible asset is recognized if and only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties, non -refundable taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates and any directly attributable expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to & has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.\n\nExpenditure incurred which are eligible for capitalizations under intangible assets are carried as intangible assets under development till they are ready for their intended use.\n\n## 3.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## 3.3.  De-recognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 3.4.  Amortization\n\nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight-line method over a period of legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less. Other intangible assets are amortized on straight-line method over the period of legal right to use or life of the related plant, whichever is less.\n\nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.\n\n## 4. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nExpense/income recognized in the statement of profit and loss to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized as 'Regulatory deferral account balances'.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are adjusted in the year in which the same become recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are evaluated at each balance sheet date to ensure that the underlying activities meet the recognition criteria and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with such balances will flow to the entity. If these criteria are not met, the regulatory deferral account balances are derecognized.\n\n## 5. Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\n## 5.1.  Oil and gas exploration activities\n\nAll exploration costs incurred in drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized as 'Exploratory wells-in-progress' under 'Intangible assets under development' till the time these are either transferred to oil and gas assets when a well is ready for commercial production or expensed as exploration cost (including allocated depreciation) as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case may be.\n\nCosts of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient quantity of reserves and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic & operating viability of the project. All such carried over costs are subject to review for impairment.\n\nCost of surveys and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Coal mining exploration activities\n\nExploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalized costs which is generally the expenditure incurred associated with finding the mineral by carrying out topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, expenditure for activities in relation to evaluation of technical feasibility and commercial viability, acquisition of rights to explore etc.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets under 'Intangible assets under development' and stated at cost less impairment if any. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators at least annually.\n\nOnce the proved reserves are determined and development of mine/project is sanctioned, Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of Coal Mines' under 'Capital Work in Progress'. However, if proved reserves are not determined, exploration and evaluation asset is derecognized.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as and when incurred.\n\n## 6. Development expenditure on coal mines\n\nWhen proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of coal mines' under 'Capital work-in-progress'.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25 % of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3) The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\nGains and losses on de-recognition of assets referred above, are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 6.1.   Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure incurred on removal of mine waste materials (overburden) necessary to extract the coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Company has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\nNet of the balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as 'Stripping activity adjustment' under the head 'Non-current assets/Non-current provisions' as the case may be, and adjusted as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations\n\n## 6.2.   Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Company estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation. Upon commercial declaration of mines, the mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations are amortized on straight line method over the balance life of the mine.\n\nThe value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 7. Joint operations\n\nThe Company has joint arrangements with others for operations in the nature of joint operations. The Company recognizes, on a line-by-line basis its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations as per the arrangement which are accounted based on the respective accounting policies of the Company.\n\n## 8. Investment Property\n\nInvestment properties are properties held to earn rental or for capital appreciation or for both and are not intended to be used in the operations of the Company. Investment properties are measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs. Cost of investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure. Investment properties are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Investment properties are depreciated / amortised considering the significant accounting policy no.1.5. Free hold Land and Properties under construction are not depreciated.\n\nA property shall be transferred to or from investment property when, and only when, there is change in use. A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.\n\nAn investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.\n\n## 9. Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and (c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Company borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nReporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.\n\nThe Company can incur borrowing costs during an extended period in which it suspends the activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use or sale. Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and is not eligible for capitalisation. However, the Company does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. The Company also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or sale.\n\n## 10. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other similar items . Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nScrap inventory is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 11. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 12. Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Company for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 13. Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 14. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.\n\n## 15. Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Company initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## 16. Revenue\n\nCompany's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from investments in joint venture & subsidiary companies, dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 16.1. Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Company's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Company's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two components: capacity charge i.e. a fixed charge that includes depreciation, return on equity, interest on working capital, operating & maintenance expenses, interest on loan and energy charge i.e. a variable charge primarily based on fuel costs. Tariff for Company's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the products or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\nThe incentives/disincentives are accounted for based on the norms notified/approved by the CERC as per principles enunciated in Ind AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power exchanges.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy through trading is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.\n\nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates is accounted for as and when sold.\n\n## 16.2. Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 16.3. Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR. For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.\n\nRevenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.\n\nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on receipt/ acceptance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee benefits\n\n## 17.1. Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit and loss in the period during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Company has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Company is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Company's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension System Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the Company/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 17.2. Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility(PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Company is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India. Shortfall in the fund assets, if any, is made good by the company and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust. The Company has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Company hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Company.\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Company if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurement comprising of actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets ( excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) & effect of asset ceiling ( excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) and the same are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they arise.\n\nPast service costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs. If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Company's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute other long term employee benefits.\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of these long-term employee benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Company's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n## 19. Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability. MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Company assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Company evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 20. Leases\n\n## 20.1. As lessee\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/ amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Company changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/ suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\n## Accounting for finance leases\n\nWhere the Company determines a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be or to contain a lease and where the off taker has the principal risk and rewards of ownership of the power plant through its contractual arrangements with the Company, the arrangement is considered a finance lease. Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income. The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Company determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Company retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 20.3. Sub-leases\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use assets arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.\n\nRental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 21. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit', or 'CGU').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operating segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108-'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Company's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Company's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, Capital Wok in Progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\nSegment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work in progress, intangible assets under development, advances for capital expenditures, trade and other receivables, inventories and other assets that can be directly or reasonably allocated to segments. For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective segments. Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 23. Business Combinations\n\n- (i) Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Company. The consideration transferred in the acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Where the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n- (ii) Business combinations involving entities that are controlled by the Company are accounted for using the pooling of interests method wherein the assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts and no adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The only adjustments that are made are to harmonise accounting policies.\n\nThe financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, where the business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information is restated only from that date.\n\nThe balance of the retained earnings appearing in the financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the transferee. The identity of the reserves is preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n\n## 24. Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.\n\n## 25. Material prior period errors\n\nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the net profit or loss amounts excluding the net movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 27. Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7-'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n## 28. Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 28.1. Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a)  The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTPL (Fair value through profit or loss)\n\nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the Company may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale/ disposal of investments. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on sale / disposal of the investments.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures companies are accounted at cost less impairment, if any.\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement\u037e and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVTOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109-'Financial instruments', the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:\n\n- (a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits and bank balance.\n- (b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI.\n- (c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.\n- (d) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.\n- (e) Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n- (f) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Company applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition.\n\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets), the Company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12 month ECL.",

Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.3. Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost is changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Company updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Company first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform and does not recognise a modification gain or loss in the profit & loss statement. After that, the Company applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.",

Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## 28.5. Derivative financial instruments\n\nInitial recognition and subsequent measurement\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks of foreign currency loans. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.6. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 29. Non -Current Assets Held for Sale\n\nThe Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal.\n\nProperty ,plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n\n## D. Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1. Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n## 2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4. Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Company considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n## 5. Revenues\n\nThe Company records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 6. Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Company, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7. Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9. Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37-'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10. Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 11. Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The land has been amortized considering the rate of depreciation provided by the CERC in the tariff regulations and the fact that it will not have any economic value due to deposit of silt and other foreign materials.\n- e) Possession of land measuring 98 acres (31 March 2022: 98 acres) consisting of 79 acres of freehold land (31 March 2022: 79 acres) and 19 acres of right of use land (31 March 2022: 19 acres) of value ' 0.21 crore (31 March 2022: ' 0.21 crore) was transferred to Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.

Accordingly, the written down value of the specified assets was derecognized from PPE and accounted as Finance Lease Receivable (FLR) on transition to Ind AS. The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease' under 'Revenue from operations' (Note 40).\n- c) As per the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India for preparation of Mine Closure Plan, Escrow Accounts have been opened for each captive mine and the balances held in these escrow accounts are presented as 'Mine closure deposit'.

The amount will be adjusted with the cost of related work or recovered from the party, depending upon the outcome of the legal proceedings.\n- d) Advances to contractors and suppliers include payments to Railways amounting to ' 1,708.03 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,862.94 crore) under customer funding model as per policy on 'Participative model for rail-connectivity and capacity augmentation projects' issued by the Ministry of Railways, GOI. As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate of dividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have achieved COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-41-'Other income'.\n- e) Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost. The deferred payroll expenditure represents the benefits on account of interest rate on loans being lower than the market rate of interest. The same is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the loan.\n\n## 13.

C.4 (Note 1). Refer Note 71 for detailed disclosures.\n- b) CERC Tariff Regulations, 2019 provide for recovery of deferred tax liability (DTL) as at 31 March 2009 from the beneficiaries.

Regulations, 2014 and Regulations, 2019 provide for grossing-up the rate of return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income.

There are no unconfirmed balances in respect of bank accounts and borrowings from banks & financial institutions. With regard to receivables for energy sales, the Company sends demand intimations to the beneficiaries with details of amount paid and balance outstanding which can be said to be automatically confirmed on receipt of subsequent payment from such beneficiaries. In addition, reconciliation with beneficiaries and other customers is generally done on quarterly basis. So far as trade/other payables and loans and advances are concerned, the balance confirmation letters/emails with the negative assertion as referred in the Standard on Auditing (SA) 505 (Revised) 'External Confirmations', were sent to the parties. Some of such balances are subject to confirmation/reconciliation. Adjustments, if any will be accounted for on confirmation/reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of the management will not have a material impact.\n- b) In the opinion of the management, the value of assets, other than property, plant and equipment and non-current investments, on realisation in the ordinary course of business, will not be less than the value at which these are stated in the Balance Sheet.\n- c) The levy of transit fee/entry tax on supplies of fuel to some of the power stations has been paid under protest as the matters are sub-judice at various courts. In case the Company gets refund/demand from fuel suppliers/tax authorities on settlement of these cases, the same will be passed on to respective beneficiaries.\n- 50 a) The environmental clearance (EC) granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India (MoEF), based on the recommendations of Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC),  for one of the Company's project consisting of three units of 800 MW each whose carrying cost as at 31 March 2023 is ' 14,586.51 crore (31 March 2022: ' 14,874.47 crore), was challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) vide appeal no.12/2012. The NGT disposed off the appeal vide Order dated March 13, 2014, inter alia, directing that the order of clearance be remanded to the MoEF to pass an order granting or declining clearance to the project proponent afresh in accordance with the law and the judgement of the NGT and also directed that the EC shall be kept in abeyance and the Company shall maintain status quo in relation to the project during the period of review by the Committee or till fresh order is passed by the MoEF, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Company filed an appeal challenging the NGT order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India which stayed the order of the NGT and the matter is sub-judice and pending for listing in the Court. The Company has been complying with various conditions stipulated in the EC and reporting to the appropriate environment authorities periodically. The EAC has been accepting the amendments sought by the Company in the EC.\n\nBased on a legal opinion, the Company does not envisage any threat to the continuance to the project. All the units of the project have been declared commercial in the earlier years and are fully operational since September 2018.\n\n- b) The Company is executing a hydro power project in the state of Uttarakhand, where all the clearances were accorded. A case was filed in Hon'ble Supreme Court of India after the natural disaster in Uttarakhand in June 2013 to review whether the various existing and ongoing hydro projects have contributed to environmental degradation. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 7 May 2014, ordered that no further construction shall be undertaken in the projects under consideration until further orders, which included the said hydro project of the Company. In the proceedings, Hon'ble Supreme Court is examining to allow few projects which have all clearances which includes the project of the Company where the work has been stopped. Aggregate cost incurred on the project up to 31 March 2023 is ' 147.90 crore (31 March 2022: ' 163.57 crore). Management is confident that the approval for proceeding with the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After the reports of recent land subsidence in Joshimath Town, Additional District Magistrate, Chamoli has issued order on 5 January 2023 to stop all the construction activities till further orders. Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand on hearing a public interest litigation on 12 January 2023, has directed the State to strictly enforce the ban on construction in Joshimath area and scheduled next hearing on 24 May 2023. As per Company's understanding,  the land subsidence in Joshimath does not have any link with the Project. The developments are closely being monitored by the Company. Aggregate cost incurred on the project up to 31 March 2023 is \u20b9 6,252.31 crore (31 March 2022: ' 5,745.28 crore). Technical and administrative works related to the project are going on.  Management does not envisage any threat to the continuance of the project and  is confident that a viable solution in connection with the project shall be arrived in due course.\n\n## 51.

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Company has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 56.88 crore (31 March 2022: ' 58.39 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly, Company has not recognised the surplus as an asset, and the remeasurement loss /gains in 'Other Comprehensive Income', as these pertain to the Provident Fund Trust and not to the Company.\n\nAs per the provisions of Employee's Provident Funds Scheme 1952, the employer shall be liable to make good the loss to the Trust  in the event of any loss as a result of any fraud, defalcation, wrong investment decisions etc. to the Trust. Keeping inview the above, a cummulative provision of ' 12.81 crore (31 March 2022: ' 17.86 crore) has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, towards such loss to the trust.\n\n## B Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, as amended. The gratuity scheme is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust. The liability for gratuity scheme is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Defined benefit obligations\n\n## i. Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe following were the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date:\n\n| Particulars                    | As at         | As at  31 March2022   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n|                                | 31 March 2023 |                       |\n| Discount rate                  | 7.40%         | 7.00%                 |\n| Expected return on plan assets |               |                       |\n| Gratuity                       | 7.40%         | 7.00%                 |\n| Pension                        | 7.40%         | 7.00%                 |\n| PRMF                           | 7.40%         | 7.00%                 |\n| Annual increase in costs       | 6.50%         | 6.50%                 |\n| Salary escalation rate         | 6.50%         | 6.50%                 |\n\nThe estimates of future salary increases considered in actuarial valuation, take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Further, the expected return on plan assets is determined considering several applicable factors mainly the composition of plan assets held, assessed risk of asset management and historical returns from plan assets.\n\n## ii. Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n'\n\nCrore\n\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Increase              | Decrease              | Increase              | Decrease              |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (197.68)              | 209.18                | (182.37)              | 191.01                |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 106.35                | (103.83)              | 88.24                 | (86.23)               |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 99.56                 | (93.90)               | 99.96                 | (95.54)               |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G. Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a) Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The Company has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from the range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Company intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## b) Changes in discount rate\n\nA decrease in discount rate will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' assets holdings.\n\n## c) Inflation risks\n\nIn the pension plans, the pension payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## d) Life expectancy\n\nThe pension plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee benefit plans. Within this framework, the Company's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Company actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Company uses derivatives to manage some of its risk.

(UPL), a joint venture of the Company. UPL inter-alia undertakes jobs such as overhauling, repair, refurbishment of various mechanical and electrical equipment of power stations. The Company has entered into Power Station Maintenance Agreement with UPL from time to time. The rates are fixed on cost plus basis after mutual discussion and after taking into account the prevailing market conditions.\n- ii) Other transactions with related parties are made on normal commercial terms and conditions and at arm length price.\n- iii) The Company is seconding its personnel to subsidiary and joint venture companies as per the terms and conditions agreed between the companies, which are similar to those applicable for secondment of employees to other companies and institutions. The cost incurred by the Company towards superannuation and employee benefits are recovered from these companies.\n- iv) In respect of transactions entered into with Utility Powertech Ltd. (UPL), a joint venture of the Company, the management had till the previous year taken a view that a fresh approval of Shareholders may not be warranted as the company had taken approval from the Shareholders of the Company in the Annual General Meeting held in August 2015 for an amount upto 2% of annual turnover of the preceding FY or ' 1000 crore, whichever is higher and approval for extension of the arrangement by the board of directors of the company as on 1st April 2021 for five years. Also, though the contracts awarded during the year were ' 2,041.26 crore, works amounting to ' 647.62 crore only have been executed during the year against these contracts. The company had sought post facto approval of the same which has not been granted by the Audit Committee of the Board. Further, the company has sought expert guidance in respect of its present position in this regard which is awaited as of date. The management is of the opinion that the same will not have any material impact on the financial statements as these are transactions being routinely carried out by the Company over the years, in the normal course of business.\n- v) Further, specific approval of the Audit Committee of the Board under section 177 of the Act has also not been accorded in respect of certain other significant related party transactions such as investments in subsidiaries/ joint venture\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard, since these transactions have either been approved by the Board/ specific sub-committee of the Board or are in the nature of transactions with wholly owned subsidiary in the ordinary course of business or mandated by specific requirements of the extant labour laws in the case of the contributions to employee benefit trust, the management is of the opinion that non-approval as above will not have material impact on the financial statements.\n\n- vi) Loans granted to subsidiaries and joint venture companies are detailed below:\n\n| Sl.

Disclosure as per Ind AS 106 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources'\n\n- a) The Company along-with some public sector undertakings had entered into Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with GOI for three oil exploration blocks namely KG-OSN-2009/1, KG-OSN-2009/4 and AN-DWN-2009/13 under VIII round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP VIII) with 10% participating interest (PI) in each of the blocks.\n\nIn the case of Block AN-DWN-2009/13 and KG-OSN-2009/1, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) was the operator and the Company along-with the consortium partners have relinquished both the blocks to Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).\n\nBased on the un-audited statement of the accounts for the above blocks forwarded by ONGC, the operator, the Company's share in the assets and liabilities and expenses is as under:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars   |   As at   31 March 2023  (Unaudited) |   As  at    31 March 2022  (Unaudited) |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Assets        |                                 0.01 |                                   0.01 |\n| Liabilities   |                                 0.49 |                                   0.49 |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, there are no income / expense  and operating/investing cash flow from exploration activities.\n\nFor exploration activities in block KG-OSN-2009/4 DGH has agreed for drilling of one well and have instructed to carry out airborne Full Tensor Gravity Gradiometer (FTG) survey in conditionally & partial cleared area. ONGC has completed drilling of one well. Airborne Full Tensor Gravity Gradiometer (FTG) survey work is also completed.

In the meanwhile, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, GoI demanded in January 2011 the cost of unfinished minimum work programme from the consortium with NTPC's share being USD 7.516 million. During the year, provision in this respect has been updated to ' 90.79 crore from ' 111.96 crore along-with interest. The Company has sought waiver of the claim citing force majeure conditions at site leading to discontinuation of exploratory activities.\n\nThe Company has accounted for expenditure of ' (21.37) crore (31 March 2022: ' 21.58 crore) towards updation of liabilities relating to MWP and other liabilities of M/s Geopetrol International, the operator to complete the winding up activities of the Block.

Pakri Barwadih was declared commercial w.e.f. 1 April 2019 and about 13.23 MMT coal was extracted during the current year. Dulanga was declared commercial w.e.f. 1 October 2020 and 7.00 MMT coal was extracted during the current year. All other mines are under development stage. In Talaipalli about 2.40 MMT coal was extracted during the year 2022-23. Coal production has started from Chatti-Bariatu since Sep.2022 and about 0.58 MMT coal was extracted during the current year. At Kerandari, coal mine extraction has already started since 5th Apr.2023 and at Chatti-Bariatu coal mining projects land acquisition and other mine development activities are in progress and these are also disclosed in Note 3 - Capital work in progress under 'Development of coal mines'. Due to delay in achievement of required condtions, the Talaipally coal mines is expected to be declared commercial in the year 2023-24.\n- d (ii) a) Exploration and evaluation activities are taking place at under ground mine area/dip side area (North west quarry) of PB block. An amount of ' 64.20 crore has since been incurred at this area towards various exploratory activities and has been transferred to development of coal mines and capitalised during the year upon completion.\n\n## d (iii) a)(i) Banai & Bhalumuda\n\nDue to geo-mining constraints and other related issues NTPC surrendered these blocks to MoC on 26.12.2020. The Company expects that whenever these two coal blocks are allotted to any other company, the cost incurred towards exploration and GR at these mines would be reimbursed from the new allocatee through MOC as per past experience of the Company. Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 124.00 crore (31 March 2022: ' 124.00 crore) has been accounted as recoverable and included under Note-19- 'Current assets - Other financial assets'.\n\n## a)(ii) Mandakini\n\nSince mine development activities could not be proceeded due to various issues, the Company has approached Ministry of Coal on 26 December 2020 for surrendering these blocks, with a request for consideration of reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Company. The Company expects that whenever these two coal blocks are allotted to any other company, the cost incurred towards exploration and GR would be reimbursed from the new allocatee through MOC as per past experience of the Company. Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 56.47 crore ( 31 March 2022: ' 53.93 crore) has been accounted as recoverable and included under Note-19 'Current assets -Other financial assets'.\n\nMoC has encashed the BG (Performance Security) of ' 168.00 crore on 22 March 2021 citing delay in achieving of the milestones of efficiency parameters which were beyond the control of the Company. The Company approached MoP to take up the matter in Alternate Mechanism for Resolution of CPSE Disputes (AMRCD). Pending resolution of the dispute through AMRCD, the amount of BG encashed by MOC has been disclosed as recoverable from MOC under 'Claims recoverable' in Note-19-'Current assets-Other financial assets'. This issue is regularly being taken up with MoC by the Company and MoP for early settlement.\n\n- a) (iii) The Coal Block Development and Production Agreement (CBDPA) signed by the Company with MOC is silent about the recoverability of expenditure incurred in case of termination of the CBDPA. Moreover, the fresh auction / allocation of mines by MOC may also take substantial time and is dependent upon the coal demand-supply scenario of the country in the days to come. Considering the uncertainty involved on the recoverability of the amounts in respect of Banai, Bhalamuda and Mandakini-B coal blocks , the amount disclosed as claims recoverable has since been fully provided for. Further, the balance expenditure incurred at these blocks which may not be recovered has also been provided for fully (Refer Note 6- 'Non-current assets - Intangible assets under development').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Company, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies. Risks are regularly monitored through reporting of key performance indicators. Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Trade receivables & unbilled revenue\n\nThe Company primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State Governments. The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India subsequently approved the extension of these TPAs for another period of 10 years. Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. GOI has notified Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 on 22 February 2021.These rules envisage that base rate of LPSC to be considered as SBI one year MCLR, as on 1 April of the financial year, plus five percent. The rate of LPSC shall be increased by 0.5 percent for every month of delay, provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\nA default occurs when in the view of management there is no significant possibility of recovery of receivables after considering all available options for recovery.\n\nAs per the provisions of the TPA, the customers are required to establish LC covering 105% of the average monthly billing of the Company for last 12 months. The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility, the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Company in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\nThese payment security mechanisms have served the Company well over the years. The Company has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of trade receivables in the past years. Since the Company has its power stations as well as customers spread over various states of India, geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.\n\nUnbilled revenue primarily relates to the Company's right to consideration for sale effected but not billed at the reporting date and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same type of contracts.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in only Government of India Securities, State Government Securities and other counterparties have a high credit rating. The management actively monitors the interest rate and maturity period of these investments. The Company does not expect the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, and has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of any of the investments.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe Company has given loans to employees, subsidiary companies, joint venture companies and other parties. Loans to the employee are secured against the mortgage of the house properties and hypothecation of vehicles for which such loans have been given in line with the policies of the Company. The loan provided to group companies are collectible in full and risk of default is negligible. Loan to APIIC is against a guarantee given by the Government of Andhra Pradesh vide GO dated 3 April 2003.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company held cash and cash equivalents of ' 3.13 crore (31 March 2022: ' 117.48 crore). The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks with high rating.\n\n## Balances with banks and financial institutions, other than cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company held balances with banks and financial institutions, including earmarked balances, of ' 3,738.60 crore (31 March 2022: ' 2,629.70 crore). In order to manage the risk, Company places deposits with only high rated banks/ institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n## (b)   Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life-time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Company has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. Hence, no impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting periods in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## (iii)   Ageing analysis of trade receivables\n\nRefer Note 15(d)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe Company has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company's Treasury department is responsible for managing the short-term and long-term liquidity requirements of the Company. Short-term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by the Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Company's Treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors. Long-term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Directors and appropriate decisions are taken according to the situation.\n\nTypically, the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a month, including the servicing of financial obligations, this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\n\nAs part of the CERC Regulations, tariff inter-alia includes recovery of capital cost. The tariff regulations also provide for recovery of energy charges, operations and maintenance expenses and interest on normative working capital requirements. Since billing to the customers are generally on a monthly basis, the Company maintains sufficient liquidity to service financial obligations and to meet its operational requirements.\n\n## (i) Financing arrangements\n\nThe Company had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| Particulars              | As at  31 March 2023   | '  Crore As at  31 March 2022   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Floating-rate borrowings |                        |                                 |\n| Cash credit              | 2,155.00               | 2,742.52                        |\n| Term loans               | 6,351.58               | 5,254.58                        |\n| Foreign currency loans   | 3,309.60               | 6,666.75                        |\n| Total                    | 11,816.18              | 14,663.85                       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Company. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other than entity's functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.\n\nThe currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 are as below:\n\n| As at 31 March 2023                                                     | '  Crore   | '  Crore   | '  Crore   | '  Crore   | '  Crore   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Particulars                                                             | USD        | EURO       | JPY        | Others     | Total      |\n| Financial assets                                                        |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 1.22       | -          | -          | -          | 1.22       |\n| Total                                                                   | 1.22       | -          | -          | -          | 1.22       |\n| Financial liabilities                                                   |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Foreign currency bonds                                                  | 15,391.81  | 4,564.32   | -          | -          | 19,956.13  |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans from banks  and financial institutions | 8,180.71   | 2,774.16   | 13,979.22  | -          | 24,934.09  |\n| Trade payables and other financial liabilities                          | 1,429.26   | 716.59     | 34.28      | 11.73      | 2,191.86   |\n| Total                                                                   | 25,001.78  | 8,055.07   | 14,013.50  | 11.73      | 47,082.08  |\n\n| As at 31 March 2022 Particulars                                         | USD       | EURO     | JPY       | Others    | '  Crore Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Financial assets                                                        |           |          |           |           |                  |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 0.33      | -        | -         | -         | 0.33             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                               | 0.01      | -        | -         | 0.02      | 0.03             |\n| Other financial assets                                                  | -         | 0.70     | -         | -         | 0.70             |\n| Total                                                                   | 0.34      | 0.70     | -         | 0.02      | 1.06             |\n| Financial liabilities                                                   |           |          |           |           |                  |\n| Foreign currency bonds                                                  | 18,015.88 | 4,307.65 | -         | 2,034.03* | 24,357.56        |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans from banks  and financial institutions | 2,088.98  | 2,853.83 | 13,314.62 | -         | 18,257.43        |\n| Trade payables and other financial liabilities                          | 2,757.32  | 857.08   | 151.64    | 30.38     | 3,796.42         |\n| Total                                                                   | 22,862.18 | 8,018.56 | 13,466.26 | 2,064.41  | 46,411.41        |\n\nThe gain/(loss) on account of exchange rate variations on all foreign currency loans and foreign currency monetary items (up to COD) is recoverable from beneficiaries. Therefore, currency risk in respect of such exposure would not be very significant.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSince the impact of strengthening or weakening of INR against USD, EURO, JPY and other currencies on the statement of profit and loss would not be very significant; therefore, sensitivity analysis for currency risk is not disclosed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company has awarded the above contracts without any intention to enter into any derivative contract or to leverage/ take position and without any option/intention to net settle at any point of time during the tenure of the contract. The Company has not separately recognised the foreign currency embedded derivative and has not designated the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss considering the same as not practicable and absence of a reliable valuation model.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising mainly from non-current borrowings with floating interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Company manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).\n\nAt the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Company's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\n|                                                      | '  Crore      | '  Crore      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Particulars                                          | 31 March 2023 | 31 March 2022 |\n| Financial Assets:                                    |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments                               |               |               |\n| Loans to related parties                             | 1,354.60      | 839.15        |\n| Loans to others                                      | 21.50         | 22.39         |\n| Bank deposits                                        | 3,634.68      | 2,512.72      |\n| Total                                                | 5,010.78      | 3,374.26      |\n| Variable-rate instruments                            |               |               |\n| Loans to related parties                             | -             | -             |\n| Total                                                | -             | -             |\n| Financial Liabilities:                               |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments                               |               |               |\n| Bonds                                                | 57,560.02     | 59,675.42     |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes*                        | 22,611.07     | 27,581.74     |\n| Rupee term loans                                     | 16.84         | 50.73         |\n| Commercial paper and Short term working capital loan | 11,509.73     | 6,631.26      |\n| Lease obligations                                    | 986.23        | 983.08        |\n|                                                      | 92,683.89     | 94,922.23     |\n| Variable-rate instruments                            |               |               |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes                         | 21,976.76     | 14,733.13     |\n| Rupee term loans                                     | 73,849.45     | 77,812.75     |\n| Cash credit                                          | -             | 474.91        |\n|                                                      | 95,826.21     | 93,020.79     |\n| Total                                                | 1,88,510.10   | 1,87,943.02   |\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments\n\nThe Company's fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes to contractual cash flows as a result of replacing the existing benchmark interest rate on an economically equivalent basis as a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform are accounted for by adjusting the effective interest rate without recognizing any direct modification gains or losses. There is no material impact on the change of the benchmark rate. The Company also plans to replace the USD LIBOR with the Term overnight SOFR before the end of its publication on June 30, 2023.\n\n(Note: IBOR-Inter Bank Offered Rates, LIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate, TONA-Tokyo Overnight Average Rate, SOFR Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n\n## 69.

This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company's Audit Committee, if any.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Company is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Company for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Company to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a)   As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nFurther, any loss or gain on account of exchange differences towards interest payment and loan repayment in respect of the foreign currency loans taken for construction of projects shall be recoverable from/payable to beneficiaries on actual payment basis, as per the said Regulations. Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Net Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of ' 960.93 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2023 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2022: (-) ' 730.39 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.). Further, an amount of ' 52.01 crore (31 March 2022: ' 35.82 crore) has been realized/recognized during the year.\n\n- (b)   Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The guidelines provide payment of superannuation benefits @ 30% of basic + DA to be provided to the employees of CPSEs which includes gratuity at the enhanced ceiling of ' 0.20 crore from the existing ceiling of ' 0.10 crore. As per Proviso 8(3) of Terms and Conditions of Tariff Regulations 2014 applicable for the period 2014-19, truing up exercise in respect of Change in Law or compliance of existing law will be taken up by CERC. The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has since been amended and the ceiling has been increased to ' 0.20 crore.\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the above-mentioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created upto 31 March 2019 (Regulatory deferral account debit balance) towards the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This was taken up with CERC through\n\n<!-- image -->",

CERC has been allowing the same progressively and during the year, the expenditure has been allowed in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 94.56 (31 March 2022: ' 127.02) has been adjusted and an amount of ' 0.49 crore (31 March 2022: ' 359.58 crore) has been reversed. Balance orders are expected in the coming years.\n\n- (c) CERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability upto 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,650.50 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,639.68 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2023 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (d)   The petition filed by the Company before CERC for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash, was favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016 subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset was created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there was shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses till 2021-22. During the year, CERC vide order dated 28.10.2022 has allowed provisional monthly billing of Ash transportation expenditure from 1 April 2022 onwards and reimbursement of expenditure already incurred from 1 April 2019 till 31 March 2022. Accordingly, an amount of ' 3,090.42 crore has been adjusted with revenue from operations pertaining to the period from 1 April 2019. Further, an amount of ' 90.18 crore has been adjusted/realised based on orders received from CERC during the year relating to period prior to 1 April 2019.

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables including unbilled revenue, contract assets and advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                      | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                  | Current               | Non-current           | Current               | Non-current           |\n| Trade receivables including unbilled revenue     | 24,741.45             | 2,399.78              | 24,747.45             | -                     |\n| Contract assets                                  | 7,096.08              | -                     | 4,100.75              | -                     |\n| Advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries | 1,708.39              | -                     | 1,574.85              | -                     |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, due to change in transaction prices and other reasons  is ' 5,035.62 crore (31 March 2022 : ' 1,890.87 crore).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\nPerformance obligations related to other contracts:\n\nFor rest of the contracts, transaction price for remaining performance obligations amounts to ' 1,082.32 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,037.51 crore) which shall be received over the contract period in proportion of the work performed/services provided by the Company.\n\n## VI. Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a. The company has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b. The Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Company has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money. The impact of subsequent modifications are duly recognized in the Statement of profit and loss.\n- VII. The Company has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n## 73.   Disclosure as per Ind AS 116 'Leases'\n\n## (A)   Company as Lessee\n\n- (i) The Company's significant leasing arrangements are in respect of the following assets:\n- (a) Premises for residential use of employees, offices and  guest houses/ transit camps on lease which are not noncancellable and are usually renewable on mutually agreeable terms. The company generally incurs amount on improvements which are significant to the respective lease and hence the cancellable period of the lease during which the company intends to continue considering the past experience / practice, is considered for the purpose of determining the lease period.\n- (b) The Company has taken electrical vehicles on operating lease for a period of six years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. Lease rentals are subject to escalation of 10% per annum.\n- (c) A helicopter on wet lease basis.\n- (d) The Company has taken certain vehicles (other than electrical) on lease for a period of four years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. There are no escalations in the lease rentals as per terms of the agreement. However, the Company has purchase option for such vehicles at the end of the lease term.\n- (e) The Company had entered into an agreement for movement of coal through inland waterways for one of its stations. As per the agreement, the operator was to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the unloading and material handling infrastructure for 7 years after which it was to be transferred to the Company at \u20b9 1/-. Refer Note no. 63 (iii) (b).\n- (f) The Company acquires land on leasehold basis for a period generally ranging from 25 years to 99 years from the government authorities which can be renewed further based on mutually agreed terms and conditions. The leases are non cancellable. These leases are capitalised at the present value of the total minimum lease payments to be paid over the lease term. Future lease rentals are recognised as 'Lease obligations' at their present values. The Right-of-use land is amortised considering the significant accounting policies of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Considering the uncertainty involved in the outcome of refree results, the Company has not recognised claims arising out of favourable CIMFR results pending receipt of referee results challenged by the coal companies, considering the provisions of Ind AS 37.  It is impracticable to estimate the financial effect of the same as its receipt is dependent on the outcome of the referee results which is wholly not within the control of the Company. Not withstanding the above, the outcome of the referee results shall be dealt with as per the provisions of CERC Tariff Regulations.\n- (iii)   CERC Tariff Regulations provide for levy of Late Payment Surcharge by generating company in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond specified number of days from the date of presentation of bill. However, in view of significant uncertainties in the ultimate collection of the said surcharge from some of the beneficiaries against partial bills as estimated by the management, an amount of ' 534.63 crore as on 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: ' 692.75 crore) has not been recognised.\n\n## C.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the Standalone Financial Statements:\n\n- (a) Note No. 50 (c) with respect to one of the projects under construction, wherein by the order dated 12 January 2023 of Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand, construction activities are banned till further order.\n- (b) Note No. 63 (iii) (b) with respect to appeal filed by the company with the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of Arbitral award pronounced against the company and the related provision made/disclosure of contingent liability as mentioned in the said note.\n- (c) Note No. 59 (f) (iv & v) which describes the related party transactions entered into by the Company during the year, which are not approved as required under applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\n\n## Sl. No. Key Audit Matter\n\n## 1. Recognition  and  Measurement  of  revenue from Sale of Energy\n\nThe  company  records  revenue  from  sale  of energy as per the principles enunciated under Ind AS 115, based on tariff approved by the Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission (CERC) as modified by the orders of Appellate Authorities.  Pending  issue  of  provisional/ final tariff order w.e.f. 01 April 2019 capacity charges  has  been  provisionally  recognised considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\nThis is considered as key audit matter due to the nature and extent of estimates made as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, which leads to recognition and measurement of revenue from sale of energy being complex and judgemental.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  40  to  the  Standalone Financial Statements, read with the Significant Accounting Policy No.C.16)\n\n## 2. Impairment  assessment  of  Property,  Plant and Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe Company has a material operational asset base (PPE) relating to generation of electricity and is one of the components for determining the tariff as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, which may be vulnerable to impairment.\n\nWe considered this as a key audit matter as the carrying value of PPE requires impairment assessment  based  on  the  future  expected cash flows associated with the power plants (Cash generating units).\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  62(a)  to  the  Standalone Financial Statements, read with the Accounting Policy No. C.21)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe have obtained an understanding of the CERC Tariff Regulations, orders, circulars, guidelines and the Company's internal circulars and procedures in respect of recognition and measurement of revenue from sale of energy comprising of capacity and energy charges and adopted the following audit procedures:\n\n- -Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of the Company's design of internal controls relating to recognition and measurement of revenue from sale of energy.\n- -Verified the accounting of revenue from sale of energy based on provisional tariff computed as per the principles of CERC Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\nBased  on  the  above  procedures  performed,  the  recognition  and measurement of revenue from sale of energy are considered to be adequate and reasonable.\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  and  tested  the  design  and operating effectiveness of controls as established by the Company's management for impairment assessment of PPE.\n\nWe evaluated the Company's process of impairment assessment in assessing the appropriateness of the impairment model including the independent assessment of discount rate, economic growth rate, terminal value etc.\n\nWe evaluated and checked the calculations of the cash flow forecasts prepared by the Company taking into consideration the CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2019 (applicable for the tariff period of 5 years from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024) along with the aforementioned assumptions.\n\nBased on the above procedures performed, we observed that the Company's  impairment  assessment  of  the  PPE  is  adequate  and reasonable.",

Deferred  Tax  Asset  relating  to  MAT  Credit Entitlement  and  corresponding  Regulatory Deferral Liability\n\nThe  company  has  recognised  deferred  tax asset  relating  to  MAT  credit  entitlement. Utilisation of MAT credit will result in lower outflow  of  Income  Tax  in  future  years  and accordingly Regulatory Deferral Liability attributable to the said MAT credit entitlement has  also  been  recognised,  payable  to  the beneficiaries  in  subsequent  periods  as  per CERC Tariff Regulations. The recoverability of this deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit entitlement is dependent upon the generation of  sufficient  future  taxable  profits  to  utilise such entitlement within the stipulated period prescribed under the Income Tax Act,1961.\n\nWe  identified  this  as  a  key  audit  matter because of the importance of this matter to the intended users of the Financial Statements and its materiality; and requirement of judgement in forecasting future taxable profits for  recognition  of  MAT  credit  entitlement considering  the  recoverability  of  such  tax credits within allowed time frame as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act,1961.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  22,  30,  55  &  71  to  the Standalone  Financial  Statements,  read  with the Accounting Policy No. C.4 and C.19)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  for  recognition  of  deferred tax  asset  relating  to  MAT  credit  entitlement  and  corresponding liability of the same in Regulatory Deferral Account including the management's judgement.\n\nWe  further  assessed  the  related  forecasts  of  future  taxable profits and evaluated the reasonableness of the considerations / assumptions underlying the preparation of these forecasts. We have also verified the regulatory deferral account balance attributable to the said MAT credit, payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods.\n\nBased  on  the  above  procedures  performed,  the  recognition  and measurement of Deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit entitlement and attributable Regulatory Deferral Liability towards beneficiaries, are considered adequate and reasonable.\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  Company's  internal instructions and procedures in respect of estimation and disclosure of contingent liabilities and adopted the following audit procedures:\n\n- -understood and tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls as established by the management for obtaining all relevant information for pending litigation cases;\n- -discussed  with  the  management  regarding  any  material developments thereto and latest status of legal matters;\n- -read various correspondences and related documents pertaining to litigation cases and relevant external legal opinions obtained by the management and performed substantive procedures on calculations supporting the disclosure of contingent liabilities;\n- -examined  management's  judgements  and  assessments  in respect of whether provisions are required;\n- -considered the management assessments of those matters that are not disclosed as contingent liability since the probability of material outflow is considered to be remote;\n- -reviewed the adequacy and completeness of disclosures;\n\nBased  on  the  above  procedures  performed,  the  estimation  and disclosures of contingent liabilities are considered to be adequate and reasonable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.\n\n## Contingent Liabilities\n\nThere  are  a  number  of  litigations  pending before various forums against the Company and the management's judgement is required for estimating the amount to be disclosed as contingent liability.\n\nWe  identified  this  as  a  key  audit  matter because  the  estimates  on  which  these amounts are based involve a significant degree of management judgement in interpreting the cases and it may be subject to management bias.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  76(A)  to  the  Standalone Financial Statements, read with the Accounting Policy No. C.14)",

The other information comprises the Corporate Governance Report, and the information included in the Directors' Report including Annexures, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and other company related information (but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon), which are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions, if required.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements, that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements,  whether  due  to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate Internal Financial Controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2020 ('the Order') issued by the Central Government of India in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, and on the basis of such checks of the books and records of the Company as we considered appropriate and according to the information and explanations given to us, we give in 'Annexure 1' a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said Order, to the extent applicable.\n- 2.

Our report expresses a modified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting.\n- (g) As per Notification No. GSR 463(E) dated 5 June 2015 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India, Section 197 of the Act is not applicable to the Government Companies. Accordingly, reporting in accordance with requirement of provisions of section 197(16) of the Act is not applicable on the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control with reference to the standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA Company's internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Statutory Auditors  appointed  by  the  Comptroller  and Auditor General of India under Section 139 (5) of the Act are responsible for expressing opinion on the financial statements under Section 143 of the Act based on independent audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act. This is stated to have been done by them vide their Audit Report dated 19 May 2023.\n\nI, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the financial statements of NTPC Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 under Section 143(6) (a) of the Act. This supplementary audit has been carried out independently without access to the working  papers  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  and is limited primarily to inquiries of the Statutory Auditors and Company personnel and a selective examination of some of the accounting records.\n\nBased on my supplementary audit, I would like to  highlight  the  following  significant  matters under Section 143 (6)(b) of  the Act  which have come to my attention and which in my view are necessary for enabling a better understanding of the financial statements and the related Audit Report:\n\nComments on Financial Position\n\nBalance sheet\n\nCapital work-in-progress (Note 3) ' 61,743.88 crore\n\nAs  per  Regulation  5.1  of  Central  Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions of  Tariff)  (Second  Amendment)  Regulations, 2021, the date of commercial operation in case of integrated mine(s), shall mean the earliest of, a) the first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25 percent of the Peak Rated Capacity as per the Mining Plan is achieved; or b) the first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production estimated in accordance with Regulation 7A of these Regulations, exceeds total expenditure in that year; or, c) the date of two years from the date of commencement of production.\n\nThe Regulation 5.1 of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2021 referred by audit also provides that 'Provided further that in case the integrated mine(s) is ready for commercial operation but is prevented from declaration of the date of commercial operation for reasons not attributable to the generating company or its suppliers or contractors or the Mine Developer and Operator, the Commission, on an application made by the generating company, may approve such other date as the date of commercial operation as may be considered appropriate after considering the relevant reasons that prevented the declaration of the date of commercial operation under any of the sub-clauses of Clause (3) of this Regulation;",

This resulted in overstatement of Capital workin-progress  and  understatement  of  Property, Plant and equipment by ' 925.80 crore each. Depreciation was also to be charged off from date of capitalisation.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\n(Sanjay K. Jha) Director General of Audit (Energy) New Delhi\n\nPlace: New Delhi Dated: 20 July, 2023\n\nPlace: New Delhi\n\nDated: 29 July, 2023\n\n(Gurdeep Singh) Chairman and Managing Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProvided also that the generating company seeking the approval of the date of commercial operation under the preceding proviso shall give prior notice of one month to the beneficiaries of the end-use or associated generating station(s)  of  the  integrated  mine(s)  regarding  the  date  of  commercial operation.'\n\nAs on date, there is no Mine Development Operator (MDO) for the subject Mine as the earlier appointed agency had left the work and the appointment of new MDO is in progress. The approved Mining Plan was challenged by the then MDO and hence the same was reviewed by Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL) who in their report suggested for changes in original mining plan. The revised mining plan was received from CMPDIL and has been put up for approval of CCO (Coal Controller Organization), in the month of January 2023. Revised mining plan is under final stage of approval with CCO. Beneficiaries have been intimated about the tentative date of declaration of commercial operation as 1 August 2023 as per the Regulations. The application to CERC for approving the date of commercial declaration as per the Regulations will be filed considering the final date of commercial operation.\n\nIn this context it would be very pertinent to bring forth certain cardinal principles of recognition of Property, plant and equipment as provided in Indian Accounting Standards. Paragraph 7 of Ind AS-16-'Property, plant and equipment' provides the recognition criteria that the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity; and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Further, Paragraph 16 of Ind AS 16 provides that any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is included in the cost of assets. Further, Paragraph 20 of Ind AS 16 also provides that Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. And paragraph 55 of Ind AS 16 provides that Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\n\nIn the case of Talaipalli coal mine, the intention of the management is to ensure sustainable production, by operating in a manner intended by the  management,  considering  the  revised  mining  plan  which  is  under consideration by the CCO. The commercial non-declaration of the Mine has been disclosed in the Note 66(d)(i) of the Standalone Financial Statements and discussed in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe commercial declaration of the Mine as at 31 March 2023 would not have been in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 16 stated above as the asset was not available for its intended use. As the asset was not capitalized, no depreciation has been charged.\n\nIn view of the above, there is no overstatement of Capital work-in-progress and understatement of Property, plant and equipment.\n\nReporting\n\nDisclosures\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reporting entity\n\nNTPC  Limited  (the  'Company'  or  'Parent  Company')  is  a  Company  domiciled  in  India  and  limited  by  shares  (CIN: L40101DL1975GOI007966). The shares of the Company are listed and traded on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited in India. The address of the Company's registered office is NTPC Bhawan, SCOPE Complex, 7 Institutional Area, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003.These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (referred to collectively as the 'Group') and the Group's interest in its joint ventures. The Group is primarily involved in the generation and sale of bulk power to State Power Utilities. Other business of the Group includes providing consultancy, project management & supervision, energy trading, oil & gas exploration and coal mining.\n\n## B. Basis of preparation\n\n## 1. Statement of Compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared on going concern basis following accrual system of accounting and comply with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and other relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 to the extent applicable.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 19 May 2023.\n\n## 2. Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. 28 of accounting policy regarding financial instruments); and\n- \u00b7 Plan assets in the case of employees defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value.\n\nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements.\n\nHistorical cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire assets at the time of their acquisition or the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation, or at the amounts of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liability in the normal course of business. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## 3. Functional and presentation currency\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ' ) which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in ( ' ) has been rounded to the nearest crore (up to two decimals), except when indicated otherwise.\n\n## 4. Current and non-current classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification.\n\nAn asset is classified as current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- \u00b7 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nA liability is classified as current when:\n\n- \u00b7 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n- \u00b7 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- \u00b7 It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- \u00b7 There is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified between current and non-current considering 12 months period as normal operating cycle.\n\n## C. Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101 - 'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16 - 'Property, plant and equipment' & Ind AS 38 - 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Group's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies are drawn up to the same reporting date as of the Company for the purpose of consolidation.\n\n## 1.1 Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Group and are continued to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nThe Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with Group's accounting policies.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in statement of profit and loss. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred to equity as specified by applicable Ind AS. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.\n\n## 1.2 Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the Group's share of other comprehensive income (OCI) of the investee in OCI. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group investment in joint venture, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Losses recognized using the equity method in excess of the entity's investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the entity's interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i.e. priority in liquidation.\n\nThe statement of profit and loss reflects the Group' share of results of operations of the joint venture. Any change in the OCI of those investee is presented as presented as part of the Group OCI. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in D.11 below.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to apply equity method of accounting for an investment because of a loss of joint control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in statement of profit and loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n## 2. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 2.1.  Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.\n\nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/ assessments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Group to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted from the directly attributable cost considered as part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 2.3.  Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 2.4.  De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 2.5.  Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation/amortization is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Group, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straightline method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration, power plants not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capital work-in-progress\n\nCost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the reporting date, is classified under capital work-in-progress.\n\nThe cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying asset.\n\nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they are ready for their intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of related assets.\n\nDeposit works/cost plus contracts are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received from the contractors.\n\nUnsettled liabilities for price variation/exchange rate variation in case of contracts are accounted for on estimated basis as per terms of the contracts.\n\n## 4. Intangible assets and intangible assets under development\n\n## 4.1.  Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn intangible asset is recognized if and only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties, non-refundable taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates and any directly attributable expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to & has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.\n\nExpenditure incurred which are eligible for capitalizations under intangible assets are carried as intangible assets under development till they are ready for their intended use.\n\n## 4.2. Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## 4.3. De-recognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 4.4. Amortization\n\nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight-line method over a period of legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less. Other intangible assets are amortized on straight-line method over the period of legal right to use or life of the related plant, whichever is less.\n\nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.\n\n## 5.

If these criteria are not met, the regulatory deferral account balances are derecognized.\n\n## 6. Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\n## 6.1.  Oil and gas exploration activities\n\nAll exploration costs incurred in drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized as 'Exploratory wells-in-progress' under 'Intangible assets under development' till the time these are either transferred to oil and gas assets when a well is ready for commercial production or expensed as exploration cost (including allocated depreciation) as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case may be.\n\nCosts of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient quantity of reserves and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic & operating viability of the project. All such carried over costs are subject to review for impairment.\n\nCost of surveys and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred.\n\n## 6.2.   Coal mining exploration activities\n\nExploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalized costs which is generally the expenditure incurred associated with finding the mineral by carrying out topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, expenditure for activities in relation to evaluation of technical feasibility and commercial viability, acquisition of rights to explore etc.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets under 'Intangible assets under development' and stated at cost less impairment if any. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators at least annually.\n\nOnce the proved reserves are determined and development of mine/project is sanctioned. Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of Coal Mines' under 'Capital Work in Progress'. However, if proved reserves are not determined, exploration and evaluation asset is derecognized.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as and when incurred.\n\n## 7. Development expenditure on coal mines\n\nWhen proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of coal mines' under 'Capital work-in-progress'.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25% of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3) The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure incurred on removal of mine waste materials (overburden) necessary to extract the coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Group has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\nNet of the balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as 'Stripping activity adjustment' under the head 'Non-current assets/Non-current provisions' as the case may be, and adjusted as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 7.2.  Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Group's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Group estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of expenditure required to settle the obligation. The Group recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation. Upon commercial declaration of mines, the mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations are amortized on straight line method over the balance life of the mine.The value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 8. Joint operations\n\nThe Group has joint arrangements with others for operations in the nature of joint operations. The Group recognizes, on a line-by-line basis its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations as per the arrangement which are accounted based on the respective accounting policies of the Group.\n\n## 9. Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and(c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and is not eligible for capitalisation. However, the Group does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. The Group also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or sale.\n\n## 10. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other similar items. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nScrap inventory is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 11. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 12. Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 13. Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 14. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation",

Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.\n\n## 15. Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities are recognized in OCI. The associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 16. Revenue\n\nGroup's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 16.1. Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Group's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Group's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two components: capacity charge i.e. a fixed charge that includes depreciation, return on equity, interest on working capital, operating & maintenance expenses, interest on loan and energy charge i.e. a variable charge primarily based on fuel costs. Tariff for Group's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\nThe incentives/disincentives are accounted for based on the norms notified/approved by the CERC as per principles enunciated in Ind AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power exchanges.\n\nExchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary items denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Regulatory deferred account balances' and such balances are adjusted in the year in which the same becomes recoverable/payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nExchange differences on account of translation of foreign currency borrowings recognized up to 31 March 2016, to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Deferred foreign currency fluctuation asset' with corresponding credit to 'Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation'. Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy through trading is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.\n\nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates is accounted for as and when sold.\n\n## 16.2. Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 16.3. Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR. For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future\n\n<!-- image -->",

When calculating the EIR, the group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the creditadjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.\n\nRevenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.\n\nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on receipt/acceptance.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\n## 17. Employee benefits\n\n## 17.1. Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit and loss in the period during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Group is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Group's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension System Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the Group/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 17.2. Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility(PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Group is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India. Shortfall in the fund assets, if any, is made good by the Group and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Group and is managed by separate trust. The Group has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Group hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) & effect of asset ceiling (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) and the same are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they arise.\n\nPast service costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognizes related restructuring costs. If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n## 17.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Group's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute other long term employee benefits.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of these long-term employee benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under performance related pay if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 18. Other expenses\n\nExpenses on ex-gratia payments under voluntary retirement scheme, training & recruitment and voluntary community development are charged to statement of profit and loss in the year incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research is charged to revenue as and when incurred. Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Group's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nDeferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit or loss or nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint venture where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are not recognized for deductible temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interest in joint arrangements where it is not probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future or taxable profit will not be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability. MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 20. Leases\n\n## 20.1. As lessee\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/ amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n## 20.2. As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\n## Accounting for finance leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be or to contain a lease and where the off taker has the principal risk and rewards of ownership of the power plant through its contractual arrangements with the Group, the arrangement is considered a finance lease. Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income. The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Group retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 20.3. Sub-leases\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use assets arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.\n\nRental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit', or 'CGU').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## 22. Operating segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108 - 'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Group's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\nSegment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work in progress, intangible assets under development, advances for capital expenditures, trade and other receivables, inventories and other assets that can be directly or reasonably allocated to segments. For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective segments. Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 23. Business Combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree and fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date (except certain assets and liabilities which are required to be measured as per the applicable standard) and the non-controlling interest is initially recognized at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquired entity and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\nBusiness combinations involving entities that are controlled by the Company are accounted for using the pooling of interests method wherein the assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts and no adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The only adjustments that are made are to harmonise accounting policies.\n\nThe financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, where the business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information is restated only from that date.\n\nThe balance of the retained earnings appearing in the financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the transferee. The identity of the reserves is preserved and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in statement of profit and loss or OCI, as appropriate. When the Group obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, then it considers such an acquisition as a business combination achieved in stages.\n\n## 24. Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.\n\n## 25. Material prior period errors\n\nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.\n\n## 26. Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the net profits or loss amounts excluding the movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 27. Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 - 'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 28.1. Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTPL (Fair value through profit or loss)\n\nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\nIn addition, the Group may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on\n\n<!-- image -->",

Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Group's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement\u037e and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments', the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:\n\n- (a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits and bank balance.\n- (b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI.\n- (c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.\n- (d) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.\n- (e) Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n- (f) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments', which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition.\n\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets), the Group determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the Group reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.\n\n## 28.2. Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.3 Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Group applied the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\n## 28.4 Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.6 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 29.   Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n\n## D. Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1. Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n## 2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\nUseful life of the assets of the generation of electricity business and integrated coal mines (where tariff is regulated) is determined by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReporting\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4. Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Group considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n## 5. Revenues\n\nThe Group records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 6. Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7. Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9. Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37 - 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10. Classification of joint arrangements\n\nGroup's joint arrangements in the nature of joint operations and joint ventures require unanimous consent from all parties sharing control for decisions about the relevant activities. Parties are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the joint arrangements. These arrangements are classified and accounted for as either joint operation or joint venture in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 111 - 'Joint Arrangements'.\n\n## 11. Impairment test of investments in Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 12. Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the event the Hon'ble High Court grants relief to the Company, the amount would be adjusted against Current liabilities - Provisions - Provision for arbitration awards (Note 39). Management expects that the total cost incurred, anticipated expenditure on the safety and stabilisation measures, other recurring site expenses and interest costs as well as claims of contractors/vendors for various packages for this project will be compensated in full by the GOI. Hence, no provision is considered necessary.\n\n- b) The Company had ascertained that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) entered into for Stage-I of a power station with the beneficiary falls under the definition of finance lease. Accordingly, the written down value of the specified assets was derecognized from PPE and accounted as Finance Lease Receivable (FLR) on transition to Ind AS. The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease' under 'Revenue from operations' (Note 42).\n- c) As per the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India for preparation of Mine Closure Plan, Escrow Accounts have been opened for each captive mine and the balances held in these escrow accounts are presented as 'Mine closure deposit'.

The amount will be adjusted with the cost of related work or recovered from the party, depending upon the outcome of the legal proceedings.\n- d) Advances to contractors and suppliers include payments to Railways amounting to ' 1,708.03 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,862.94 crore) under customer funding model as per policy on 'Participative model for rail-connectivity and capacity augmentation projects' issued by the Ministry of Railways, GOI. As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate of dividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have acheived COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-43-'Other income'.\n- e) Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost.

Accordingly, DTL as at 31 March 2009 is recoverable on materialisation from the beneficiaries. Regulations, 2014 and Regulations, 2019 provide for grossing-up the rate of return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. Accordingly, deferred tax liability for the period from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related DTL forms part of current tax.

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Group has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 46.63 crore (31 March 2022: ' 32.83 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly, Group has not recognised the surplus as an asset, and the actuarial gains in 'Other Comprehensive Income', as these pertain to the Provident Fund Trust and not to the Group.\n\nAs per the provisions of Employee's Provident Funds Scheme 1952, the employer shall be liable to make good the loss to the Trust  in the event of any loss as a result of any fraud, defalcation, wrong investment decisions etc. to the Trust. Keeping inview the above, a provision of ' 12.81 crore (31 March 2022 ' 17.86 crore) has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year, towards such loss to the trust.\n\n## B. Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act,1972, as amended.\n- b) The Group has pension schemes at two of its stations in respect of employees taken over from erstwhile state government power utilities. These pension schemes are unfunded. The liability for the pension schemes is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n\nBased on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the gratuity and pension plan and the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements as at balance sheet date:\n\n| Particulars                             | As at   31 March 2023   | '  Crore As at   31 March 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Net defined benefit (asset)/liability : |                         |                                  |\n| Gratuity (funded)                       | (24.71)                 | 88.05                            |\n| Gratuity (non-funded)                   | 174.92                  | 183.91                           |\n| Pension (non-funded)                    | 532.75                  | 560.57                           |\n|                                         | 682.95                  | 832.53                           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe following were the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date:\n\n| Particulars                    | As at   31 March 2023   | As at   31 March 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Discount rate                  | 7.40%                   | 7.00%                   |\n| Expected return on plan assets |                         |                         |\n| Gratuity                       | 7.40%                   | 7.00%                   |\n| Pension                        | 7.40%                   | 7.00%                   |\n| PRMF                           | 7.40%                   | 7.00%                   |\n| Annual increase in costs       | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n| Salary escalation rate         | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n\nThe estimates of future salary increases considered in actuarial valuation, take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Further, the expected return on plan assets is determined considering several applicable factors mainly the composition of plan assets held, assessed risk of asset management and historical returns from plan assets.\n\n## ii. Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n|                                          |                     |                     |                     | '  Crore            |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2023 | As at 31 March 2023 | As at 31 March 2022 | As at 31 March 2022 |\n|                                          | Increase            | Decrease            | Increase            | Decrease            |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (227.16)            | 240.79              | (209.62)            | 219.39              |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 113.20              | (110.39)            | 94.21               | (91.99)             |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 115.38              | (109.12)            | 114.25              | (109.62)            |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G. Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a) Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The equity securities are expected to earn a return in excess of the discount rate and contribute to the plan deficit. The Group has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Group intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n## b) Changes in discount rate\n\nA decrease in discount rate will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' assets holdings.\n\n## c) Inflation risks\n\nIn the pension plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## d) Life expectancy\n\nThe pension plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee benefit plans. Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Group uses derivatives to manage some of its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.\n\nA large portion of assets consists of government and corporate bonds. The plan asset mix is in compliance with the requirements of the respective local regulations.\n\n## H.

(UPL), a joint venture of the Company, the management had till the previous year taken a view that a fresh approval of Shareholders may not be warranted as the company had taken approval from the Shareholders of the Company in the Annual General Meeting held in August 2015 for an amount upto 2% of annual turnover of the preceding FY or ' 1000 crore, whichever is higher and approval for extension of the arrangement by the board of directors of the company as on 1st April 2021 for five years. Also, though the contracts awarded during the year were ' 2,041.26 crore, works amounting to ' 647.62 crore only have been executed during the year against these contracts. The company had sought post facto approval of the same which has not been granted by the Audit Committee of the Board. Further, the company has sought expert guidance in respect of its present position in this regard which is awaited as of date. The management is of the opinion that the same will not have any material impact on the financial statements as these are transactions being routinely carried out by the Company over the years, in the normal course of business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard, since these transactions have either been approved by the Board/ specific sub-committee of the Board or are in the nature of transactions with wholly owned subsidiary in the ordinary course of business or mandated by specific requirements of the extant labour laws in the case of the contributions to employee benefit trust, the management is of the opinion that non-approval as above will not have material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## (vi) Loans granted to joint venture companies are detailed below:\n\n| Sl.   | Name of the               | Loan granted          | Rate of                                                                       | Purpose                   | Year of grant  of loan   |\n|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| No.   | joint venture             | (Amount in  '  crore) | interest (p.a.)

The Company is of the view that provisions of Ind AS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' are not applicable to the investments made in PTC India Ltd. and the same has been accounted for as per the provisions of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments'. Based on a review during the year with regard appropriateness of accounting of the same under Ind AS 109, a reference has been made to Expert Advisory Committee of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India , awaiting receipt of opinion.

Disclosure as per Ind AS 36 'Impairment of Assets'\n\nAs required by Ind AS 36, an assessment of impairment of assets was carried out and following has been assessed:\n\n- (i) The recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment & intangible assets of the Cash Generating Units (CGU) of the parent company is value in use and amounts to ' 2,87,698.56 crore (31 March 2022: ' 2,67,954.01 crore).  The net realisable value of the assets of the station has been assessed which is more than its carrying value. The discount rate used for the computation of value in use for the generating plant (thermal, gas and hydro) and coal mining is 7.27% (31 March 2022: 7.07%) and for solar plant is 6.42% (31 March 2022: 6.20%).\n- (ii) Based on the impairment study of Ratnagiri Gas & Power Pvt Ltd (RGPPL), an impairment loss of  \u20b9 28.80 crore (31 March 2022: ' 228.16 crore) has been recognised during the year. The impairment study has been done using Recoverable value method rather than Value in Use since in view of prevailing gas scenario in the global market, RGPPL is not able to enter into any PPA. Accordingly, realizable value is considered as Fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nIn the previous year, the impairment study was done using the discounted cash flow income approach. The post tax discount rate used for the future cash flows was 18%. The differential discount rate is based on the effective tax rates likely to be applicable during the forecast years. Salvage value of PPE & CWIP and release of net working capital at the end of explicit period has been added to the present value of free cash flows to arrive at the enterprise value.

The Group has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Group, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the parent company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies. Risks are regularly monitored through reporting of key performance indicators. Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India subsequently approved the extension of these TPAs for another period of 10 years. Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. On 22 February 2021, Ministry of power has issued a notification and accordingly Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC) shall be payable on the payment outstanding after the due date at the base rate of LPSC applicable for the period for the first month of default and the rate of LPSC for the successive months of default shall increase by 0.5 percent for every month of delay provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\nA default occurs when in the view of management there is no significant possibility of recovery of receivables after considering all available options for recovery.\n\nAs per the provisions of the TPA, the customers are required to establish LC covering 105% of the average monthly billing of the Company for last 12 months. The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Group in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\nIn addition to above, MoP vide its communications dated 28 June 2019 and  subsequent clarifications, further emphasised  on ensuring availability of suitable payment security mechanism to be maintained by DISCOMs. Further, to liquidate the outstanding dues of the discoms towards the generating companies, GOI has announced a Scheme for offering ' 90,000 crore in soft loans under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package. The Discoms are expected to take the benefit of the this Scheme and pay their outstanding dues.\n\nThese payment security mechanisms have served the Group well over the years. The Group has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of trade receivables in the past years. Since the Group has its power stations as well as customers spread over various states of India, geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.\n\nUnbilled revenue primarily relates to the Group's right to consideration for sale effected but not billed at the reporting date and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same type of contracts.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in only Government of India Securities, State Government Securities and other counterparties have a high credit rating. The management actively monitors the interest rate and maturity period of these investments. The Group does not expect the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, and has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of any of the investments.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe Group has given loans to employees, joint venture companies and other parties. Loans to the employee are secured against the mortgage of the house properties and hypothecation of vehicles for which such loans have been given in line with the policies of the Company. The loan provided to group companies are collectible in full and risk of default is negligible. Loan to APIIC is against a guarantee given by the Government of Andhra Pradesh vide GO dated 3 April 2003.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents of ' 465.65 crore (31 March 2022: ' 675.77 crore). The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks with high rating.\n\n## Deposits with banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Group held deposits with banks and financial institutions of ' 4,482.88 crore (31 March 2022: ' 3,782.31 crore). In order to manage the risk, Group places deposits with only high rated banks/institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n## (b)   Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Group has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. Hence, no impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting periods in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## (iii)   Ageing analysis of trade receivables\n\nRefer Note 15(g)\n\n## (iv)   Reconciliation of impairment loss provisions\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of financial assets during the year was as follows:\n\n| Particulars                                                               | Investments   | Trade       | Loans       | Advances    | Claims      | '  Crore Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n|                                                                           | receivables   | receivables | receivables | recoverable | recoverable | recoverable      |\n| Balance as at 1 April 2021 (i)                                            | 4.48          | 546.84      | -           | 0.11        | 343.62      | 895.05           |\n| Impairment loss recognised (ii)                                           | -             | -           | -           | -           | 3.16        | 3.16             |\n| Amounts written off / written  back / adjustment during the  period (iii) | -             | 67.39       | -           | -           | -           | 67.39            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group's treasury department is responsible for managing the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the Group. Short term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Group's treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors. Long term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Directors and appropriate decisions are taken according to the situation.\n\nTypically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a month, including the servicing of financial obligations, this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\n\nAs part of the CERC regulations, tariff inter alia includes recovery of capital cost. The tariff regulations also provide for recovery of energy charges, operations and maintenance expenses and interest on normative working capital requirements. Since billing to the customers are generally on a monthly basis, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to service financial obligations and to meet its operational requirements.\n\n## (i) Financing arrangements\n\nThe Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| Particulars              | 31 March 2023   | '  Crore 31 March 2022   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Floating-rate borrowings |                 |                          |\n| Cash credit              | 4,758.50        | 4,181.62                 |\n| Term loans               | 24,232.99       | 18,933.83                |\n| Foreign currency loans   | 3,309.60        | 8,841.01                 |\n| Total                    | 32,301.09       | 31,956.46                |\n\n## (ii) Maturities of financial liabilities\n\nThe following are the contractual maturities of derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities, based on contractual cash flows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Group. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Group manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).\n\nAt the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\n|                                                      | '  Crore      | '  Crore      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Particulars                                          | 31 March 2023 | 31 March 2022 |\n| Financial Assets:                                    |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments                               |               |               |\n| Loan to related parties                              | 14.07         | 20.53         |\n| Loans to others                                      | 21.53         | 22.46         |\n| Bank deposits                                        | 3,846.43      | 3,180.71      |\n| Total                                                | 3,882.03      | 3,223.70      |\n| Financial Liabilities:                               |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments                               |               |               |\n| Bonds                                                | 67,904.26     | 69,536.88     |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes*                        | 23,012.47     | 28,023.45     |\n| Rupee term loans                                     | 308.09        | 506.30        |\n| Commercial paper and Short term working capital loan | 11,509.73     | 6,631.26      |\n| Lease obligations                                    | 1,820.79      | 1,151.30      |\n| Total (A)                                            | 1,04,555.34   | 1,05,849.19   |\n| Variable-rate instruments                            |               |               |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes                         | 23,342.48     | 15,870.97     |\n| Rupee term loans                                     | 95,240.79     | 89,904.79     |\n| Cash credit and short term loans                     | 1,364.22      | 1,899.21      |\n| Total (B)                                            | 1,19,947.49   | 1,07,674.97   |\n| Total (A+B)                                          | 2,24,502.83   | 2,13,524.16   |\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments\n\nThe Group's fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\n\nA change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes to contractual cash flows as a result of replacing the existing benchmark interest rate on an economically equivalent basis as a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform are accounted for by adjusting the effective interest rate without recognizing any direct modification gains or losses. There is no material impact on the change of the benchmark rate. The Company also plans to replace the USD LIBOR with the Term overnight SOFR before the end of its publication on June 30, 2023.\n\n(Note: IBOR-Inter Bank Offered Rates, LIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate, TONA-Tokyo Overnight Average Rate, SOFR Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n\n## 69.

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.\n\n| Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value- recurring  fair value measurement as at 31 March 2023   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | '  Crore  Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Financial assets:                                                                                                |           |           |           |                   |\n| Investments in quoted equity instruments - PTC India Ltd.                                                        | 102.30    | -         | -         | 102.30            |\n| Investments in unquoted equity instruments                                                                       | -         | -         | 5.40      | 5.40              |\n|                                                                                                                  | 102.30    | -         | 5.40      | 107.70            |\n\n| Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value- recurring fair  value measurement as at 31 March 2022   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | '  Crore  Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Financial assets:                                                                                                |           |           |           |                   |\n| Investments in quoted equity instruments - PTC India Ltd.                                                        | 98.70     | -         | -         | 98.70             |\n| Investments in unquoted equity instruments                                                                       | -         | -         | 5.40      | 5.40              |\n|                                                                                                                  | 98.70     | -         | 5.40      | 104.10            |\n\nThe Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the audit committee.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This level includes mutual funds which are valued using the closing NAV.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from prevailing market transactions and dealer quotes of similar instruments.\n\nThere have been no transfers in either direction for the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.\n\n## (c)   Valuation technique used to determine fair value:\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to fair value of financial instruments include:\n\n- i) For financial instruments other than at ii), iii) and iv) - the use of quoted market prices.\n- ii) For investments in mutual funds - Closing NAV is used.\n- iii) For  financial  liabilities  (vendor  liabilities,  debentures/bonds,  foreign  currency  notes,  domestic/foreign  currency loans):  Discounted cash flow; appropriate market borrowing rate of the entity as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n- iv)   For financial assets (employee loans) - Discounted cash flow; appropriate market rate (SBI lending rate) as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n\n## (d)   Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                          | Level   | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                      |         | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            |\n| Financial assets                                     |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Other investments                                    | 3       | 575.00                | 575.00                | -                     | -                     |\n| Loans                                                | 3       | 822.55                | 781.43                | 830.18                | 830.18                |\n| Finance lease receivables                            | 3       | 285.19                | 285.19                | 355.49                | 355.49                |\n| Claims recoverable                                   | 3       | 1,153.04              | 1,153.04              | 915.05                | 915.05                |\n| Trade receivables                                    | 3       | 31,463.90             | 31,463.90             | 27,970.87             | 27,970.87             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | 1       | 465.65                | 465.65                | 675.77                | 675.77                |\n| Bank balances other than cash and cash equiva- lents | 1       | 4,482.88              | 4,482.88              | 3,782.31              | 3,782.31              |\n| Other financial assets                               | 3       | 8,374.54              | 8,374.54              | 5,573.58              | 5,573.58              |\n| Total                                                |         | 47,622.75             | 47,581.63             | 40,103.25             | 40,103.25             |\n| Financial liabilities                                |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Bonds/Debentures                                     | 1       | -                     | -                     | 8,820.73              | 9,810.68              |\n|                                                      | 2       | 12,357.58             | 13,249.47             | 30,220.36             | 33,011.39             |\n|                                                      | 3       | 55,546.68             | 56,852.50             | 30,495.79             | 33,220.19             |\n| Foreign currency notes                               | 2       | 15,369.34             | 15,247.39             | 17,984.99             | 18,305.90             |\n|                                                      | 3       | 4,554.79              | 4,203.16              | 6,328.53              | 6,446.15              |\n| Foreign currency loans                               | 3       | 26,391.54             | 26,408.92             | 19,580.90             | 19,580.90             |\n| Rupee term loans                                     | 2       | 10,467.49             | 10,096.03             | 11,037.33             | 10,748.21             |\n|                                                      | 3       | 85,081.41             | 84,900.31             | 79,209.43             | 79,617.56             |\n| Lease Obligations                                    | 3       | 1,820.79              | 1,820.79              | 1,151.30              | 1,151.30              |\n| Borrowings - current                                 | 1       | 12,873.95             | 12,873.95             | 8,530.47              | 8,530.47              |\n| Trade payables & payable for capital expenditure     | 2       | 3.63                  | 4.35                  | 8.19                  | 7.89                  |\n|                                                      | 3       | 35,110.04             | 35,139.45             | 32,714.09             | 32,763.96             |\n| Other financial liabilities                          | 3       | 4,927.99              | 4,927.99              | 4,673.79              | 4,673.79              |\n| Total                                                |         | 2,64,505.23           | 2,65,724.31           | 2,50,755.90           | 2,57,868.39           |",

Capital Management\n\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to:\n\n- -safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and\n- -maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the primary responsibility to maintain a strong capital base and reduce the cost of capital through prudent management in deployment of funds and sourcing by leveraging opportunities in domestic and international financial markets so as to maintain investors, creditors & markets' confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the Company defines as returns from operating activities divided by total shareholders' equity deployed in operating activities. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to equity shareholders in line with the dividend distribution policy of the Company.\n\nUnder the terms of major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenants:\n\n- (i) Total liability to networth ranges between 2:1 to 3:1.\n- (ii) Ratio of EBITDA to interest expense shall not at any time be less than 1.75 : 1.\n- (iii)   Debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.10:1 (in case of foreign currency borrowings).\n\nThere have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest bearing borrowings.\n\nThe Group monitors capital, using a medium term view of three to five years, on the basis of a number of financial ratios generally used by industry and by the rating agencies. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using gearing ratio which is net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises of non-current and current borrowings less cash and cash equivalent. Equity includes equity share capital and reserves that are managed as capital.

Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Group is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Group for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Group to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a) As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nFurther, any loss or gain on account of exchange differences towards interest payment and loan repayment in respect of the foreign currency loans taken for construction of projects shall be recoverable from/payable to beneficiaries on actual payment basis, as per the said Regulations. Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Net Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,021.81 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2023 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2022: (-) ' 807.87 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.). Further, an amount of ' 52.01 crore (31 March 2022: ' 35.82 crore) has been realized/recognized during the year.\n\n- (b) Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The guidelines provide payment of superannuation benefits @ 30% of basic + DA to be provided to the employees of CPSEs which includes gratuity at the enhanced ceiling of ' 0.20 crore from the existing ceiling of ' 0.10 crore. As per Proviso 8(3) of Terms and Conditions of Tariff Regulations 2014 applicable for the period 2014-19, truing up exercise in respect of Change in Law or compliance of existing law will be\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has since been amended and the ceiling has been increased to ' 0.20 crore.\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the above-mentioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created upto 31 March 2019 (Regulatory deferral account debit balance) towards the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This was taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition. CERC has been allowing the same progressively and during the year, the expenditure has been allowed in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 94.56  crore (31 March 2022: ' 127.02 crore) has been adjusted and an amount of (-) ' 48.43 crore (31 March 2022: ' 359.58 crore) has been reversed. Balance orders are expected in the coming years.\n\n- (c) CERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability upto 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,796.22 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,753.50 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2023 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (d) The petition filed by the Company before CERC for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash, was favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016 subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset was created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there was shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses till 2021-22. During the year, CERC vide order dated 28.10.2022 has allowed provisional monthly billing of Ash transportation expenditure from 1 April 2022 onwards and reimbursement of expenditure already incurred from 1 April 2019 till 31 March 2022. Accordingly, an amount of ' 3,090.42 crore has been adjusted with revenue from operations pertaining to the period from 1 April 2019. Further, an amount of ' 90.18 crore has been adjusted/realised based on orders received from CERC during the year relating to period prior to 1 April 2019.  Balance amount of ' 73.11 crore shall be reversed / adjusted upon receipt of tariff orders / true-up orders from CERC.\n- (e) CERC while determining the annual fixed cost of the Tuirial Hydro Electric Project (TrHEP) of NEEPCO, a subsidiary of the Company, for the period of 30.10.2017 to 31.03.2019 by CERC, allowed depreciation @2% for the said purposes in line with the decision of the Public Investment Board (PIB) of the Govt. of India. The rates and methodology as per the CERC tariff regulations based on which depreciation for TrHEP has been calculated and charged to the Statement of Profit & Loss vary from that allowed to recover through tariff as per the CERC order. Due to higher rate of depreciation as per the CERC regulations, depreciation charged for the first 12 (twelve) years of operation TrHEP will be more than that of the depreciation recoverable through tariff, which will be reversed in future periods during remaining period of normative life of the generating station. Accordingly, the lower depreciation realized during the earlier period of its operation will be recovered/adjusted during later period. In view of above, an amount of ' 41.14 crore (31 March 2022: ' 41.18 crore) being the difference of depreciation  to the extent recoverable/adjustable in future period has been recognized as Regulatory deferral account debit balances.\n\n## (iii)   Risks associated with future recovery/reversal of regulatory deferral account balances:\n\n- (a) demand risk due to changes in consumer attitudes, the availability of alternative sources of supply\n- (b) regulatory risk on account of changes in regulations and submission or approval of a rate-setting application or the entity's assessment of the expected future regulatory actions.\n- (c) other risks including currency or other market risks, if any.\n\n## (iv) Reconciliation of the carrying amounts:\n\nThe regulated assets/liability recognized in the books to be recovered from or payable to beneficiaries in future periods are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables including unbilled revenue, contract assets and advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                      | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                  | Current               | Non-current           | Current               | Non-current           |\n| Trade receivables including unbilled revenue     | 28,825.22             | 2,638.68              | 27,970.87             | -                     |\n| Contract assets                                  | 7,306.43              | -                     | 4,750.11              | -                     |\n| Advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries | 2,044.10              | -                     | 1,895.36              | -                     |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to change in transaction prices is ' 5,092.94 crore (31 March 2022 : ' 2033.82 crore).\n\n## V. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\nPerformance obligations related to other contracts:\n\nFor rest of the contracts, transaction price for remaining performance obligations amounts to ' 1,082.32 crore (31 March 2022: ' 1,037.51 crore) which shall be received over the contract period in proportion of the work performed/services provided by the Group.\n\n## VI. Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a. The Group has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b. The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money. The impact of subsequent modifications are duly recognized in the Statement of profit and loss.\n- VII. The Group has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contingent assets\n\n- (i) While determining the tariff for some of the Parent Company's power stations, CERC has disallowed certain capital expenditure incurred by the Parent Company. The Parent Company aggrieved over such issues has filed appeals with the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL)/Hon'ble Supreme Court against the tariff orders issued by the CERC. Based on past experience, the Parent Company believes that a favourable outcome is probable. However, it is impracticable to estimate the financial effect of the same as its receipt is dependent on the outcome of the judgement.\n- (ii) Coal companies have disputed some of the grade slippages confirmed by CIMFR(third party sampler)  in favour of the Company and have approached referee challenging the CIMFR results. The referee results are binding on both the parties. Considering the uncertainty involved in the outcome of refree results, the Company has not recognised claims arising out of favourable CIMFR results pending receipt of referee results challenged by the coal companies, considering the provisions of Ind AS 37.  It is impracticable to estimate the financial effect of the same as its receipt is dependent on the outcome of the referee results which is wholly not within the control of the Company. Not withstanding the above, the outcome of the referee results shall be dealt with as per the provisions of CERC Tariff Regulations.\n- (iii)   CERC (Terms & Conditions of Tariff) Regulations 2019-24 provide for levy of Late Payment Surcharge by generating company in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond 45 days from the date of presentation of bill. However, in view of significant uncertainities in the ultimate collection from some of the beneficiaries against partial bills as resolved by the management, an amount of ' 754.90 crore as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: ' 1,072.77 crore) has not been recognised.\n\n## C.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nConsidering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on 'Using the work of Another Auditor' including materiality, we draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the Statements:\n\n- (a) Note No. 64(iii)(b) with respect to appeal filed by the Holding Company with the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of Arbitral award pronounced against the holding company and the related provision made/disclosure of contingent liability as mentioned in the said note.\n- (b) Note No. 53(c) with respect to one of the projects under construction of Holding Company, wherein by the order dated 12 January 2023 of Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand, construction activities are banned till further order.\n- (c) Note No. 61(f)(iv & v) which describes the related party transactions entered into by the Holding Company during the year, which are not approved as required under applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. Considering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on 'Using the work of Another Auditor' including materiality, below Key Audit Matters have been reproduced from the Independent Auditors' report on the audit of Standalone Financial Statements of the Holding Company.\n\n## Sl. No. Key Audit Matter\n\n## 1. Recognition and Measurement of revenue from Sale of Energy\n\nThe company records revenue from sale of energy as per the principles enunciated under Ind AS 115, based on tariff approved by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  (CERC)  as  modified  by  the  orders  of Appellate Authorities. Pending issue of provisional/final tariff order w.e.f. 01 April, 2019 capacity charges has been provisionally recognised considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\nThis  is  considered  as  key  audit  matter  due  to  the nature and extent of estimates made as per the CERC Tariff  Regulations,  which  leads  to  recognition  and measurement  of  revenue  from  sale  of  energy  being complex and judgmental.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  42  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, read with the Significant Accounting Policy No. C.16)\n\n## 2. Impairment assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe  Company  has  a  material  operational  asset  base (PPE) relating to generation of electricity and is one of the  components  for  determining  the  tariff  as  per  the CERC Tariff Regulations, which may be vulnerable to impairment.\n\nWe considered this as a key audit matter as the carrying value  of  PPE  requires  impairment  assessment  based on the future expected cash flows associated with the power plants (Cash generating units).\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  63  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, read with the Accounting Policy No. C.21)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  CERC  Tariff Regulations, orders, circulars, guidelines and the Company's  internal  circulars  and  procedures  in  respect of recognition and measurement of revenue from sale of energy  comprising  of  capacity  and  energy  charges  and adopted the following audit procedures:\n\n- -Evaluated  and  tested  the  effectiveness  of  the Company's  design  of  internal  controls  relating  to recognition and measurement of revenue from sale of energy.\n- -Verified the accounting of revenue from sale of energy based  on  provisional  tariff  computed  as  per  the principles of CERC Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\nBased on the above procedure performed, the recognition and  measurement  of  revenue  from  sale  of  energy  is considered to be adequate and reasonable.\n\nWe have obtained an understanding and tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls as established by the Company's management for impairment assessment of PPE.\n\nWe  evaluated  the  Company's  process  of  impairment assessment  in  assessing  the  appropriateness  of  the impairment model including the independent assessment of discount rate, economic growth rate, terminal value etc.\n\nWe evaluated and checked the calculations of the cash flow  forecasts  prepared  by  the  Company  taking  into consideration the CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations,  2019  (applicable  for  the  tariff  period  of  5 years from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024) along with the aforementioned assumptions.\n\nBased on the above procedures performed, we observed that the Company's impairment assessment of the PPE is adequate and reasonable.",

Deferred Tax Asset relating to MAT Credit Entitlement and corresponding Regulatory Deferral Liability\n\nThe company has recognised deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit entitlement. Utilisation of MAT credit will result in lower outflow of Income Tax in future years and accordingly Regulatory Deferral Liability attributable to the said MAT credit entitlement has also been recognised, payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations. The recoverability of this deferred  tax  asset  relating  to  MAT  credit  entitlement is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable  profits  to  utilise  such  entitlement  within  the stipulated  period  prescribed  under  the  Income  Tax Act,1961.\n\nWe identified this as a key audit matter because of the importance of this matter to the intended users of the Financial Statements and its materiality; and requirement of judgement in forecasting future taxable profits for recognition of MAT credit entitlement considering the recoverability of such tax credits within allowed time frame as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act,1961.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  23,32,57  &  72  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, read with the Accounting Policy No. C.5 and C.19)\n\n## 4. Contingent Liabilities\n\nThere are a number of litigations pending before various forums  against  the  Company  and  the  management's judgement is required for estimating the amount to be disclosed as contingent liability.\n\nWe identified this as a key audit matter because the estimates on which these amounts are based involve a significant degree of management  judgement in  interpreting  the  cases  and  it  may  be  subject  to management bias.\n\n(Refer  Note  No.  76(A)  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, read with the Accounting Policy No. C.14)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  for  recognition  of deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit entitlement and attributable  liability  of  the  same  in  Regulatory  Deferral Account including the management's judgement.\n\nWe  further  assessed  the  related  forecasts  of  future taxable profits and evaluated the reasonableness of the considerations/assumptions  underlying  the  preparation of these forecasts. We have also verified the regulatory deferral account balance corresponding to the said MAT credit payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods.\n\nBased on the above procedures performed, the recognition and measurement of Deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit  entitlement  and  attributable  Regulatory  Deferral Liability towards beneficiaries, is considered adequate and reasonable.\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  Company's internal instructions and procedures in respect of estimation and disclosure of contingent liabilities and adopted the following audit procedures:\n\n- -understood  and  tested  the  design  and  operating effectiveness  of  controls  as  established  by  the management for obtaining all relevant information for pending litigation cases;\n- -discussed  with  the  management  regarding  any material developments thereto and latest status of legal matters;\n- -read various correspondences and related documents pertaining  to  litigation  cases  and  relevant  external legal  opinions  obtained  by  the  management  and performed  substantive  procedures  on  calculations supporting the disclosure of contingent liabilities;\n- -examined management's judgements and assessments in respect of whether provisions are required;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and its Joint Ventures or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the holding company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures incorporated in India have adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Holding Company's management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its joint ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiaries and joint ventures, incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the 'Other Matters' paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the internal financial controls of the Group and its Joint Venture Companies incorporated in India, with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Basis for Qualified Opinion\n\nAccording to the information and explanations given to us and based on our audit, the following material weakness has been identified as at March 31, 2023:\n\nThe Holding Company did not have an appropriate internal control system to ensure that related party transactions are undertaken only after approval under the provisions of sections 177 of the Companies Act, 2013 as well as the provisions of Regulation 23 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 by the Audit Committee of Board and Shareholders of the Holding company wherever applicable, as a result material transactions were entered into by the Holding company during the year without approval as required under the said provisions, as detailed in Note No. 61(f)(iv & v) of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nA 'material weakness' is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal financial control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\n## Qualified Opinion\n\nIn our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, except for the possible effects of the material weakness described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion Paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Holding Company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Group and its Joint Venture Companies incorporated in India considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by ICAI.\n\nWe have considered the material weakness identified and reported above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the March 31, 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company, and the material weakness has not affected our opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to nine subsidiaries and seven joint ventures incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The statutory auditors appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India under section 139(5) read with section 129(4) of the Act are responsible for expressing opinion on the financial statements under section 143 read with section 129(4) of the Act based on independent audit in accordance with the standards on auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act. This is stated to have been done by them vide their Audit Report dated 19 May 2023.\n\nI, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the consolidated financial statements of NTPC Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 under Section 143(6) (a) read with section 129(4) of the Act. We conducted a  supplementary  audit  of  financial  statements  of NTPC Limited, and subsidiaries, associate companies and jointly controlled entities listed in Annexure I but did not conduct supplementary audit of the financial statements  of  subsidiaries,  associate  companies and  jointly  controlled  entities  listed  in  Annexure II for the year ended on that date. Further, section 139(5) and 143(6)(a) of the Act are not applicable to Utility Powertech Limited and NTPC - GE Power Services  Private  Limited  being  private  entities  and Tricomalee Power Company Limited and Bangladesh -  India  Friendship  Power  Company  Private  Limited being incorporated in foreign country(ies) under the respective laws, for appointment of their Statutory Auditors  and  for  conduct  of  supplementary  audit. Accordingly,  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of India  has  neither  appointed  the  Statutory  Auditors nor  conducted  the  supplementary  audit  of  these companies.  This  supplementary  audit  has  been carried  out  independently  without  access  to  the working papers of the statutory auditors and is limited primarily to inquiries of the statutory auditors and company personnel and a selective examination of some of the accounting records.\n\nBased on my supplementary audit, I would like to highlight  the  following  significant  matter  under section 143(6)(b) read with section 129(4) of the Act which has come to my attention and which in my view is necessary for enabling a better understanding of the financial statements and the related audit report:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  resulted  in overstatement of Capital work-in-progress and understatement  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment by ' 925.80 crore each. Depreciation was also to be charged off from date of capitalisation.\n\n## ANNEXURE-I\n\nList of Subsidiaries, Associate Companies and Jointly Controlled Entities whose financial statements were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\n- 1.

The approved Mining Plan was challenged by the then MDO and hence the same was reviewed by Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL) who in  their  report  suggested  for  changes  in  original  mining  plan.  The revised mining plan was received from CMPDIL and has been put up for approval of CCO (Coal Controller Organization), in the month of January 2023. Revised mining plan is under final stage of approval with CCO. Beneficiaries have been intimated about the tentative date of  declaration  of  commercial  operation  as  1  August  2023  as  per the Regulations.  The application to CERC for approving the date of commercial declaration as per the Regulations will be  filed considering the final date of commercial operation.\n\nIn this context it would be very pertinent to bring forth certain cardinal principles of recognition of Property, plant and equipment as provided in Indian Accounting Standards. Paragraph 7 of Ind AS-16-'Property, plant and equipment' provides the recognition criteria that the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if  it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity; and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Further, Paragraph 16 of Ind AS 16 provides that any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is included in the cost of assets. Further, Paragraph 20 of Ind AS 16 also provides that Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. And paragraph 55 of Ind AS 16 provides that Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.",

The management at the Company is also responsible for preparing the designed Integrated Annual Report 2022-23. The Company's responsibilities include designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Report that is free from any material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. It also includes conducting the materiality assessment process to identify material topics relevant for the Company based on the responses of the internal and external stakeholders. The Company ensures that it complies with the reporting criteria and local regulations. It designs, implements, and effectively operates controls to achieve the stated control objectives; selects and applies policies; makes judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; and maintains adequate records in relation to the Report. The Company is also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its activities. The Company is responsible for ensuring that the Company's staff involved with the preparation of the Report are properly trained, systems are properly updated, and that any changes in reporting encompass all significant operational sites.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to examine the Report prepared by the Company and to report thereon on the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the form of an independent assurance conclusion based on the evidence obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain a meaningful level of assurance about whether the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report comply with the reporting standards in all material respects, as the basis for our assurance conclusions.\n\nThe Firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the Firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), which is founded on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour. The assurance procedures selected depend on our understanding of the Report of the Company and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of the areas where material misstatements are likely to arise.\n\nIn obtaining an understanding of the Report and other engagement circumstances, we have considered the process used to prepare the Report in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion as to the effectiveness of the Company's process or internal controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report.\n\nOur engagement also included: assessing the appropriateness of the select non-financial sustainability disclosures and the suitability of the criteria used by the Company, evaluating the appropriateness of the methods, policies and procedures, and models used, and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company in the context of the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our professional judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the select non-financial disclosures whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we have considered internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the select non-financial disclosure is likely to arise.

The management at the Company is also responsible for preparing the designed Integrated Annual Report 2022-23. The Company's responsibilities include designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Report that is free from any material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. It also includes conducting the materiality assessment process to identify material topics relevant for the Company based on the responses of the internal and external stakeholders. The Company ensures that it complies with the reporting criteria and local regulations. It designs, implements, and effectively operates controls to achieve the stated control objectives; selects and applies policies; makes judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; and maintains adequate records in relation to the Report. The Company is also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its activities. The Company is responsible for ensuring that the Company's staff involved with the preparation of the Report are properly trained, systems are properly updated, and that any changes in reporting encompass all significant operational sites.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to examine the Report prepared by the Company and to report thereon on the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the form of an independent assurance conclusion based on the evidence obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain a meaningful level of assurance about whether the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report comply with the reporting standards in all material respects, as the basis for our assurance conclusions.\n\nThe Firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the Firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), which is founded on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour. The assurance procedures selected depend on our understanding of the Report of the Company and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of the areas where material misstatements are likely to arise.\n\nIn obtaining an understanding of the Report and other engagement circumstances, we have considered the process used to prepare the Report in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion as to the effectiveness of the Company's process or internal controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report.\n\nOur engagement also included: assessing the appropriateness of the select non-financial sustainability disclosures and the suitability of the criteria used by the Company, evaluating the appropriateness of the methods, policies, and procedures, and models used, and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company in the context of the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a limited assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a limited assurance engagement been performed.\n\nAs part of this engagement, we have not performed any procedures by way of audit, review, or verification of the financial disclosures nor of the underlying records or other sources from which the financial statements and information was extracted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our professional judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the select non-financial disclosures whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we have considered internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the select non-financial disclosure is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the select non-financial disclosures, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Undertook site visits to the Company's generation station at Dadri, Mouda, and Koldam. We selected these sites based on the nature & size of the operations, the contribution of the site to the select non-financial disclosures, and the geographic location of the site.\n- \u00b7 Through inquiries, obtained an understanding of the Company's control environment, processes, and information systems relevant to the preparation of the select non-financial disclosures, but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 Performed analytical procedures by comparing the expected performance data of the select non-financial disclosures with the actual performance data and made inquiries of management to obtain explanations for any significant differences we identified.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\n## Scope and Boundary\n\nThe scope of assurance covers the select non-financial sustainability data related to the disclosures based on the reference reporting criteria, as mentioned below:\n\n- \u00b7 The scope of assurance covers the topic-specific disclosures of NTPC as mentioned in the table below, for the period 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2023.\n- \u00b7 The boundary of assurance covers the non-financial performance of the following power generating stations owned by NTPC and NTPC-Joint Venture and subsidiary companies in India mapped against respective disclosure.\n\n## Reference Reporting Criteria - GRI Standards 2021 Reporting Boundary for Assurance\n\n## Materials (2016):\n\n- \u00b7 GRI 301-1 (Materials used by weight or volume)\n\n- \u00b7 33 NTPC-owned power generation stations\n- \u00b7 NTPC-SAIL Power Company Limited (Joint Venture)\n- \u00b7 North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (Subsidiary)\n- \u00b7 NTPC Tamil Nadu Energy Company Limited (Joint Venture)\n- \u00b7 Bharat Rail Bijlee Company Limited (Subsidiary)\n- \u00b7 Meja Urja Private Limited (Joint Venture)\n- \u00b7 Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Ltd (Subsidiary)\n- \u00b7 Aravali Power Company Limited (Joint Venture)\n- \u00b7 Jhabua Power Limited (Joint Venture)\n- \u00b7 The data for biomass consumption of 20034 MT is excluded from the assurance scope.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, for the select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Report subjected to limited assurance procedures as defined under the scope of assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the select non-financial sustainability disclosures are not fairly presented in all material respects based on the GRI Standards.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including professionals with suitable skills and experience in auditing environmental, social and economic information in line with the requirements of ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard. Our work was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which requires, among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) be independent of the assurance client, in relation to the scope of this assurance engagement, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code also includes detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code and to prevent conflicts regarding independence. The firm applies ISQM 1 and the practitioner complies with the applicable independence and other ethical requirements of the IESBA code.\n\n## Restriction on Use of Our Report\n\nOur report should not be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than the Company for any purpose or in any context. Any party other than the Company who obtains access to our report or a copy thereof and chooses to rely on our report (or any part thereof) will do so at its own risk. We accept or assume no responsibility and deny any liability to any party other than the Company for our work, for this independent assurance report, or for the conclusion we have reached.\n\nOur report is released to the Company on the basis that it shall not be copied, referred to or disclosed, in whole (save for the Company's own internal purposes) or in part, without our prior written consent.\n\nSd/-\n\n## Apurba Mitra,\n\nPartner, ESG Services, KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP 04 th August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",
