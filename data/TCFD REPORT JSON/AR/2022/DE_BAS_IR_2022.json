It shows how we are developing as a company and how we create value for our stakeholders.\n\n## On the cover and this page:\n\nBASF aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 compared with 2018 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. A key lever on this path is the gradual conversion to energy from renewable sources. As part of our make & buy approach, we are building and expanding our own renewable power assets worldwide, and we are securing renewable energy sources by entering into long-term supply agreements. The photos on the cover and this page show Rebecca Kuo. Together with Javier Cuellar (left) and Christopher Dorow (right), she helped to expand BASF's green power supply in North America in 2022 - for example, with power purchase agreements for solar energy totaling almost 300 megawatts. One of the recipients will be BASF's Verbund site in Freeport, Texas, where we will be able to meet the site's entire expected demand for purchased power with renewable sources.\n\nFor more information on energy supply, see page 137 and basf.com/climate\\_protection\n\n<!-- image -->",

We show how we as a company create value for our stakeholders and how sustainability contributes to BASF's long-term success as an integral part of our corporate purpose and our strategy.\n\n## Content and structure\n\nThe BASF Report, which is published each year in English and German,  combines  the  major  financial  and  sustainability-related information necessary to comprehensively evaluate the company's performance. We select the report's topics based on the following principles: materiality, completeness, sustainability context, balance and stakeholder inclusion. In addition to this report, we publish further information online. The relevant links can be found at the end/uni00A0of each chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe information on the financial position and performance of the BASF Group comply with the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, where applicable, the German Commercial Code (HGB), German Accounting Standards (GAS) and the guidelines on alternative performance measures from the  European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Internal control mechanisms ensure the reliability of the information presented  in  this/uni00A0 report.  BASF's  Board  of  Executive  Directors confirmed  the  effectiveness of the internal control measures and compliance with the  regulations for financial reporting.\n\nWe have reported on our sustainability performance in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and standards since 2003. The information contained in this report also serves as a progress report on BASF's implementation of the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact. The GRI and Global Compact Index can be found in the online report. It provides an overview of all relevant information to fulfill the GRI indicators and shows how we contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of the U.N. Global Compact. KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has performed an independent limited assurance of the disclosures in the GRI Index. The results of this assurance are also available in the online report in the form of an assurance statement. We also publish online additional information on sustainability in accordance with the industry-specific requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\nBASF's Report addresses elements of the framework of the former International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). This framework and the SASB's industry-specific requirements are now being incorporated into the work of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop internationally recognized standards for sustainability  reporting.  The  frameworks  help  us  illustrate  the impacts of our actions and explain how we create value for the environment, society and business (see page 24). Our involvement in networks and in national and international standard-setting  bodies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngives us the opportunity to share our experiences of integrated reporting with stakeholders and at the same time, give and receive inspiration for enhancing our reporting.\n\nMaterial topics along the value chain form the focal points of our reporting and define the limits of this report. In identifying, prioritizing and validating material topics, we are guided by the principle of double materiality, taking into consideration financial materiality and impact materiality. General information on the materiality analysis can be found under 'Our Sustainability Concept' from page 46 onward. The material topics are explained in this report in the 'Material Topics in  Focus' sections.\n\nFor more information on the results of operations, net assets and financial position,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsee page 56 onward\n\nFor more information on our sustainability reporting, see from page 45 and 100 onward\n\n- The 2022 BASF Online Report can be found at basf.com/report\n\nThe GRI and Global Compact Index can be found at basf.com/en/gri-gc\n\nThe SASB index can be found at basf.com/sasb",

The data and information for the reporting period were sourced from the expert units responsible using representative methods. Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up  exactly to the totals shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown.\n\nThe reporting period is the 2022/uni00A0business year. We include relevant information made available up to the preparation of this report by the Board of Executive Directors at the accounts meeting on February/uni00A020, 2023 (editorial deadline).\n\nBASF/uni00A0Group's scope of consolidation for its financial reporting comprises BASF/uni00A0SE, with its headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and all of its fully consolidated subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated joint operations. Shares in joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for, if material, using the equity method in the BASF/uni00A0 Group Consolidated Financial Statements and are thus not included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe section 'Employees' refers to employees active in a company within the BASF/uni00A0Group scope of consolidation as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nOur data collection methods for environmental protection and safety are based on the recommendations of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). In the section 'We Produce Safely and Efficiently,' we report all data of the worldwide production sites of BASF/uni00A0SE, its fully consolidated subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated joint operations. BASF/uni00A0SE subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in the Group financial statements in which BASF holds an interest of less than 100% are included in full in environmental reporting. The emissions of proportionally consolidated joint operations are disclosed pro rata according to our shareholding. Work-related accidents at all sites of BASF/uni00A0SE and its subsidiaries as well as joint operations and\n\njoint  ventures  in  which  we  have  authority  in  terms  of  safety management  are compiled worldwide regardless of our interest and/uni00A0 reported in full.

Since February 24, 2022, a war has been raging in Ukraine - in the middle of Europe. This is a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine, and it marks a new era for all of us. We absolutely condemn Russia's invasion.\n\nThere are considerable consequences for the global economy, and future developments are very uncertain. The past year was characterized by rising energy prices, inflation and fears of far-reaching economic turmoil.\n\nNatural gas is one of our most important energy sources and a key raw material. The gradual reduction of Russian gas deliveries and the associated increase in energy prices in Europe presented us with immense challenges. Thanks to the\n\nincredible efforts of the BASF team, we were able to significantly reduce our gas consumption in Europe. Now, we would still be able to operate our largest site in Ludwigshafen even if we only had around 30% of the average gas volume that we consumed in 2021.\n\n## Our economic performance in 2022\n\nNot only in Europe did 2022 turn out to be funda mentally different than had been expected at the  beginning of the year. In addition to the volatile global economy and high inflation, China's strict zero-COVID policy also had an adverse impact on markets. Nevertheless, BASF's business proved robust. In 2022, sales rose by 11% to \u20ac87.3 billion (2021: \u20ac78.6 billion). Our  employees demonstrated exceptional dedica-\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF's business proved robust in 2022.\n\ntion. We were able to implement price hikes in nearly all segments. Income from operations  (EBIT)  before  special  items  amounted  to  \u20ac6.9  billion,  down  by \u20ac890/uni00A0 million compared with the \u20ac7.8 billion recorded in 2021, but within our forecast range.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine destroyed the political, economic and social ties between Russia and the West that had been built up over decades. We therefore decided to wind down our business in Russia and Belarus in 2022. The sole exception is our business that supports food production, as the war also increases the risk of a global food crisis. Wintershall Dea, in which BASF owns the majority of ordinary shares, will also cease its activities in Russia. Due to the developments there, BASF had to write down its stake in Wintershall Dea by several billion euros. For the BASF Group, this resulted in negative net income for the year.\n\nThe considerable slowing of the global economy also impacted the stock markets. After reaching its 2022 high of \u20ac68.69 on February 11, BASF's share price fell over the course of the year. At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, we want to propose a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share, equal to the prior-year level. This would represent a payment of \u20ac3.0 billion to shareholders. Based on the 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

The energy transformation is still at the top of our agenda. As the industry leader, we continue to make great strides here. We are working hard to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. Our goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This transformation  requires endurance, resources and - most importantly - our combined knowledge. It is an enormous undertaking, but we are making good progress. I am very proud that teams at all our sites are pursuing this goal with great passion.\n\nThis includes the colleague shown on the cover of this report. She and many others are working to further expand our supply of green electricity in North America. As one example, our Verbund site in Freeport, Texas, is already benefiting from new purchase agreements for solar energy. We want our future energy purchases to come from renewable sources and are pursuing this strategy worldwide.\n\nWe  are  also  investing  in  our  own  capacity  to produce green electricity. At the Schwarzheide site in  Germany, for example, our new solar park that we operate with a partner went online at the end of August 2022. In the North Sea, work is progressing as planned on the offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust Zuid, a joint project with Vattenfall and Allianz.\n\nLast July, the first volumes of green electricity arrived at the Ludwigshafen site. This wind farm is slated to become fully operational in 2023.\n\n\u00bb\n\n## Our production - New technologies for the Verbund of the future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We are also charting new territory when it comes to our production methods.\n\nWe are also breaking new ground in terms of how we produce, for example, in Zhanjiang in southern China, where we are building a new Verbund site. Once completed, Zhanjiang will be our third-largest Verbund site after Ludwigshafen and  Antwerp. It is an ambitious project in the chemical industry's most dynamic growth market. In Zhanjiang we will deploy the newest and most innovative technologies, making the site a role model for sustainable production - in China and worldwide. \u00bb\n\nWe  are  also  transforming  our  existing  sites.  Our Verbund site in Antwerp aspires to be the first petrochemical  site  to  approach  net  zero  emissions  by 2030, in part thanks to new, energy-efficient tech-\n\nnologies. The Ludwigshafen site is also forging ahead, and we are testing many trailblazing approaches in pilot projects there. One of these is the steam cracker of the future that we are developing with our partners SABIC and Linde. It will be heated with electricity from  renewable sources instead of natural gas. This project is being supported by Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. Over its more than 150-year history, BASF's raw material base has changed again and again - from coal tar, to oil, to natural gas and now to renewables. I am therefore confident our transfor mation will be successful this time, too.\n\n## Our strength - We are close to our customers\n\nThe transformation toward value chains and products with low or zero carbon footprints will give us a competitive edge. In 2022, we further expanded our portfolio of products with a  certified reduced carbon footprint. In this way, we help our customers to achieve their own sustainability goals.\n\nWe are stepping up our investments in growth regions because a more balanced regional portfolio makes us more resilient in a multipolar world. We are focusing\n\n<!-- image -->",

Not having a presence in large growth markets, such as China, would be a major risk for BASF. Of course, we also assess our investments from various perspectives. We are therefore watching developments in China very closely and continuing our open dialog.\n\nWe are expanding MDI production at our site in Geismar, Louisiana. Our aim is to grow together with our MDI customers in North America and around the world, whether in the construction sector, the automotive industry or in shoe and  furniture manufacturing. The total investment volume of around $1 billion makes it BASF's largest single investment in North America to date.\n\nWe also further expanded our global business with battery materials in 2022. This includes investments to increase our production capacities for cathode materials and to establish innovative recycling concepts in the three key regions  Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n## Our operating environment - 2023 to remain challenging\n\nThe year 2023 will also bring significant chal lenges. The high level of  uncertainty will continue. Unlike the beginning of 2022, there will no longer be momentum\n\nfrom pent-up  demand following the coronavirus pandemic. The difficult global economic situation will  dampen demand worldwide.\n\nThe year 2023 will also bring significant challenges.\n\nWe are prepared for what lies ahead and we have put ourselves on the right track. We will continue to reduce our dependency on natural gas. This is particularly a matter of urgency in\n\nEurope, as we expect prices to remain significantly above pre- crisis levels in the long term. We are making our sites leaders in climate- neutral  production. And we are strengthening our competitiveness. One contribution here will be from a cost-savings program with a focus on Europe and  especially  Germany.\n\n\u00bb\n\nWe  want  to  shape  the  transformation.  But  industry  can  only  provide  a stable  foundation for prosperity when it operates in a competitive framework.\n\nMost  recently, the war in Ukraine has made it clear that  many  urgently  needed   modernization  efforts in   Germany  and  Europe  have  been  delayed  for too long/uni00A0 - digitalization, the sluggish expansion of renewable energy and the necessary  investments in infrastructure. We can no longer afford for approval processes to take a decade or for projects to be endlessly  debated. In Germany in  particular, we are still slamming on the brakes even though now is the time to accelerate.\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompetitive industry is a stable foundation for prosperity.\n\nMoreover, the European Commission's Green Deal will unleash a flood of regu lations on the chemical  industry, putting an additional burden on us. We therefore urgently need to reset priorities. This will  require that policymakers, society and industry work together  toward a common goal: a competitive industry that is strong enough to be the motor of change. We also continue to rely on the support of our many shareholders. I appreciate your trust and I am glad that you are joining us on this journey. Thank you!\n\nYours,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMartin Bruderm\u00fcller\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was primarily attributable to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the drastic increase in energy prices, high inflation, increased interest rates and pandemic-related lockdowns in China. These developments dampened demand in many sectors and had a negative impact on economic growth, especially in Europe. BASF will nevertheless propose a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Based on the year-end share price for 2022, BASF/uni00A0shares offer a high dividend yield of around 7.3%.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA BASF share price declined by 24.9% in 2022\n- /uni25AA Proposed dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share at prior-year level\n- /uni25AA Dividend yield of around 7.3% based on the 2022 year-end share price\n\n## BASF share performance\n\nBASF's/uni00A0 share price reached an annual high of \u20ac68.69 on February/uni00A011, 2022, before declining over the remainder of the year. This was mainly attributable to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the associated risks to natural gas supplies in Europe. The resulting higher energy prices negatively impacted the competitiveness of energy-intensive companies in Europe in particular.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn/uni00A0 addition, high inflation and increased interest rates weakened demand in key customer industries, especially in the second half of the year.\n\nAssuming  that dividends were reinvested, BASF's share performance declined by 19.7% in 2022. The benchmark indexes of the  German and European stock markets - the DAX/uni00A040 and the EURO STOXX 50 - fell by 12.3% and 9.5% over the same period,\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  global  industry  index  MSCI  World  Chemicals lost 15.5%.\n\n## Proposed dividend\n\nIt is to be proposed to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting that a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share, at the same level as previous year, and thus \u20ac3.0/uni00A0billion 1 be paid out to the shareholders of BASF/uni00A0SE.\n\nWith this proposed dividend, BASF/uni00A0shares offer a high dividend yield of around 7.3% based on the year-end share price for 2022. BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the 15/uni00A0companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX/uni00A040.\n\n## Share buyback program\n\nOn January/uni00A04, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE resolved on a share buyback program. The program has a volume of up to \u20ac3/uni00A0 billion, started on January/uni00A0 11, 2022, and shall be concluded by December/uni00A031, 2023, at the latest.\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2022, BASF/uni00A0 SE had acquired  24,623,765 company shares for a purchase price of \u20ac1.3/uni00A0billion. This  corresponded to 2.68% of outstanding shares. The repurchased shares were canceled and the share capital was reduced by the corresponding pro rata amount (\u20ac31,518,419.20).\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to buy back company shares in an amount of up to 10% of the share capital.\n\nIn addition to dividend payments, share buybacks are another tool that BASF uses to create value for its shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Broad base of international shareholders\n\nWith over 900,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest publicly owned companies with a high free float. An analysis of the  shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2022 showed that, at around  19% of share capital, the United States and Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional investors. Institutional investors from Germany accounted for around 6%. Institutional investors from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold 7% of BASF shares, while  investors from the rest of Europe hold a further 11% of capital.  Approximately 45% of the company's share capital is held by private investors, nearly all of whom reside in Germany. BASF is therefore one of the DAX companies with the largest percentage of private  shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees becoming shareholders\n\nIn many countries, we offer share purchase programs that turn our employees into BASF shareholders. In 2022, for example, around 27,100/uni00A0employees (2021: around 23,600) purchased BASF shares worth \u20ac92.8/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac38.2/uni00A0million).\n\nFor more information on employee share purchase programs, see page/uni00A0101 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

We combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility. Around 111,500/uni00A0employees contribute to the BASF/uni00A0Group's success worldwide. Our business is divided into the Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies, Nutrition/uni00A0& Care and Agricultural Solutions segments.\n\n## Sites and Verbund\n\nAs one of the world's largest chemical companies, BASF is present in 91/uni00A0 countries. We operate 239/uni00A0 production sites worldwide. The foundation for the Verbund concept was laid in 1865 at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany and is still one of BASF's great strengths today. Intelligently linking and steering our Verbund plants creates efficient value chains - from basic chemicals to high value- added solutions such as coatings or crop protection products. The  Verbund enables  us  to  manage  our  production  in  a  resource- efficient, carbon- optimized and reliable way. By-products from one facility are used as feedstocks elsewhere, for example. This saves us raw materials and energy, avoids emissions, lowers logistics costs and leverages synergies.\n\nIn addition to Ludwigshafen, BASF operates five other Verbund sites in Antwerp, Belgium; Freeport, Texas; Geismar, Louisiana; Kuantan, Malaysia; and Nanjing, China. Another Verbund site is being built in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.\n\nWe also use the Verbund principle for more than production, applying it to technologies, the market and digitalization as well. Research expertise is bundled globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/en/verbund\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our segments' investments, see page/uni00A037 onward\n\n## The BASF Group's segments in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chemicals\n\nThe Chemicals segment supplies BASF's other segments and customers with basic chemicals and intermediates.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 17%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac93/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac1,701/uni00A0million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nThe Surface Technologies segment offers chemical solutions for surfaces and automotive coatings, as well as battery materials and catalysts.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 24%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac335/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac740/uni00A0million\n\n## Agricultural Solutions\n\nThe Agricultural Solutions segment is an integrated provider of seeds, crop protection and digital solutions for the agricultural sector.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 12%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac944/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac414/uni00A0million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materials\n\nThe Materials segment offers advanced materials and their precursors for the plastics and plastics processing industries.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 21%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac201/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac880/uni00A0million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nutrition/uni00A0& Care\n\nThe Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segment produces ingredients and solutions for consumer applications such as human and animal nutrition, and home and personal care.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 9%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac172/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac642/uni00A0million\n\n## Industrial/uni00A0Solutions\n\nThe Industrial/uni00A0Solutions segment develops and markets ingredients and additives for industrial applications.\n\n- /uni25AA Share of sales: 12%\n- /uni25AA R&D expenses: \u20ac172/uni00A0million\n- /uni25AA Investments including acquisitions: 1 \u20ac322/uni00A0million",

We provide a high level of transparency around the results of our segments and show the importance of the Verbund and value chains to our business success. The operating divisions, the service units, the regions and the corporate center are the  cornerstones  of  the  BASF  organization.  This  organizational structure lays the foundation for customer proximity, competitiveness and profitable growth. BASF aims to differentiate its businesses from their competitors and establish a high-performance organization to enable BASF to be successful in an increasingly competitive market environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the products and services offered by the segments, see pages 72, 76, 79, 82, 85 and 88 onward\n\nFor more information on the segment structure, see Note/uni00A05 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 219 onward\n\nThe divisions bear strategic and operational responsibility and are organized according to sectors or products. They manage the 52/uni00A0 global and regional business units and develop strategies for 72/uni00A0strategic business units.\n\nBASF's regional and national companies represent the Group locally and support the growth of business units with local proximity to customers.  For  financial  reporting  purposes,  we  organize  the regional companies into four regions: Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, as well as South/uni00A0America, Africa and Middle East.\n\nTo strengthen our innovation capabilities, we reorganized our global research activities in 2022 and aligned them even more closely with the needs of our customers. As part of this, we integrated downstream research into the divisions and bundled activities with broad relevance for our customers in a research division. This division is globally positioned with research centers in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.\n\n- For more information on the reorganization of our research activities, see page 49 onward\n\nFive service units provide competitive services for the operating divisions  and  sites:  Global  Engineering  Services,  Global  Digital Services, Global Procurement, European Site/uni00A0& Verbund Management and Global Business Services (finance, human resources, environmental  protection,  health,  safety  and  quality,  intellectual property, communications, procurement, supply chain and in-house consulting services).\n\nWe have driven forward the bundling of services and resources in the Global Business Services unit, making greater use of the digi talization of processes. This aims to achieve annual savings of more than \u20ac200/uni00A0million from 2023. 1\n\nThe Corporate Center supports the Board of Executive Directors in steering the company as a whole. These include central tasks from the following areas: strategy, finance and controlling, compliance and law, tax, environmental protection, health, safety and quality, human resources, communications, investor relations, corporate audit and the Net Zero Accelerator unit.\n\n- 1 Part of these savings is included in the \u20ac500/uni00A0million cost savings program announced in October 2022.\n- 2 The number of customers refers to all external companies (sold-to parties) that had contracts with the BASF/uni00A0Group in the business year concerned in which sales were generated.\n- 3 BASF considers all direct suppliers of the BASF/uni00A0Group in the business year concerned as Tier/uni00A01 suppliers. These are suppliers that provide us with raw materials, investment goods, consumables and services. Suppliers can be natural persons, companies or legal persons under public law.\n\n## Procurement and sales markets\n\nBASF supplies products and services to around 82,000/uni00A0customers 2 from various sectors in almost every country in the world. Our customer portfolio ranges from major global customers and small and medium-sized enterprises to end consumers.\n\nWe work with over 70,000/uni00A0Tier/uni00A01 suppliers 3 worldwide. They supply us with important raw materials, chemicals, investment goods and consumables, and perform a range of services.\n\n- For more information on customers, see page 26; for more on suppliers, see page/uni00A0114 onward; for more on raw materials, see page/uni00A0117 onward\n\n## BASF sales by industry 2022\n\nDirect customers\n\n| > 20%   | Chemicals and plastics | Transportation (respectively)                                    |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 10%-20% | Agriculture | Consumer goods (respectively)                                               |\n| < 10%   | Construction | Electronics | Energy and resources |   Health and nutrition (respectively) |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Business and competitive environment\n\nBASF's global presence means that it operates in the context of local,  regional  and  global  developments  and  a  wide  range  of conditions. These include:\n\n- - Global economic and political environment\n- - Legal and political requirements\n- - International trade agreements\n- - Industry standards\n- - Environmental agreements (such as the E.U./uni00A0Emissions Trading System)\n- - Social aspects (such as the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights)\n\nBASF holds one of the top three market positions in around  80% of the business areas in which it is active.  Our most important global  competitors  include  Arkema,  Bayer,  Clariant,  Corteva, Covestro, Dow, Dupont, DSM, Evonik, Huntsman, Lanxess, SABIC, Sinopec,  Solvay,  Sumitomo  Chemical,  Syngenta,  Wanhua  and many hundreds of local and regional competitors. We expect competitors from Asia and the Middle East in particular to continue to grow in significance in the years ahead.\n\n## Challenging market conditions in Europe\n\nOn February/uni00A0 24, 2022, Russia launched a war against Ukraine. BASF strongly condemns the Russian attack on Ukraine. As a consequence, the company announced on April/uni00A027, 2022, that it would wind down its existing business activities in Russia in accordance with international law. Exempt from this decision is  business to support food production, as the war risks triggering a global food crisis. The decision to withdraw from Russia led to  special charges in EBIT of \u20ac72/uni00A0million, including impairments on property, plant and equipment of \u20ac14/uni00A0million. In/uni00A02021, Russia and Belarus accounted for around 1% of the BASF/uni00A0Group's total sales.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has significantly changed the economic environment in Europe. Above all, reduced gas supplies from Russia led to much higher and volatile commodity and energy prices and exception ally high uncertainty, especially surrounding the gas supply. As a result, the European gas price peaked at a monthly average of \u20ac235.94/uni00A0per MWh ($69.84/uni00A0per mmBtu) in August 2022. In December 2022, it was significantly lower, averaging \u20ac118.25/uni00A0 per MWh ($36.74/uni00A0per mmBtu), but still more than five times the U.S. gas price (Henry Hub). European gas prices averaged \u20ac124.16/uni00A0 per Mwh ($38.01/uni00A0 per mmBtu) for the year, more than double the prior-year level and more than ten times the 2020 level. The consequences of/uni00A0 the gas price increase are manifold: In addition to strong cost pressure, it is driving inflation, weakening the economy and slowing demand from our customer industries. This development made production  adjustments  necessary  in  Europe's  energy-intensive industries. BASF took a variety of measures here. For example, ammonia production was temporarily scaled back and partly offset by higher plant utilization at non-European sites and through procurement. BASF also reduced its consumption of natural gas in European  production  by  switching  to  alternative  fuels  wherever technically possible and economically viable. Even though European gas prices were already higher than U.S. prices before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, they are expected to decline again with the targeted substitution and diversification of gas procurement sources and the shift to other energy sources, but to remain well above pre-crisis levels.\n\nAnother factor leading to generally challenging conditions for the European chemical industry include planned regulations under the European Green Deal. These will have far-reaching consequences for the regulation of chemicals in Europe. All of these headwinds are weakening the competitiveness of European chemical production.\n\nAgainst this background and given the significant decline in earnings /uni00A0 in our European market, we have announced a cost-cutting program focusing on Europe and above all Germany. Concrete measures are currently being developed. The program will be implemented in 2023 and 2024 and is expected to generate annual savings of \u20ac500/uni00A0million in non-production areas upon completion. In\n\nparallel, we are developing further measures to structurally adjust BASF's Production Verbund in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how BASF is reducing its natural gas consumption, see page 118\n\n## Corporate legal structure\n\nAs the publicly listed parent company of the BASF/uni00A0Group, BASF/uni00A0SE takes a central position: Directly or indirectly, it holds the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF/uni00A0Group, and is also one of the largest  operating  companies.

Our customers are at the center of everything we do. With our products and technologies, our innovative and  entrepreneurial spirit and the power of our Verbund integration, we want to grow profitably and at the same time, create value for society and the environment. This is our goal, which is embedded in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nHumankind is facing enormous challenges. The climate is  changing, natural resources are becoming scarcer, pressure on ecosystems is increasing and our growing world population needs to be fed. More and more urgently than ever, solutions are needed for a sustainable future . Chemistry plays a key role here. In almost all areas of life, it can pave the way to greater sustainability with innovative products and technologies and accelerate the change needed to achieve this. This belief is expressed in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nOur mission and motivation is to grow profitably and make a positive contribution to society and the environment. For example, BASF's solutions help to protect the climate, avoid or recycle waste,  use resources more efficiently, produce healthy and affordable food, and enable climate-smart mobility.\n\nAt the same time, we are undergoing profound changes . We need to transform our company, as we have done repeatedly in the more than 150-year history of BASF. This time, we are moving toward climate neutrality and the circular economy. This involves managing long-term policy decisions like the European Green Deal,  overcoming the consequences of current geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, and driving forward digitalization. All of this requires a clear vision as well as a high degree of creativity and flexibility.\n\nBoth long-term trends and short-term developments in an environment characterized by volatility and uncertainty are challenging for the chemical industry. At the same time, they also open up   numerous opportunities for new business areas and innovative products.\n\nWe want to lead the way in the chemical industry and responsibly shape the change - with ambitious targets and a concrete roadmap: We are gradually switching our energy and raw materials supplies from fossil to renewable sources. We are adapting our Verbund  structure  to  the  new  circumstances  as  the  basis  for resource-efficient, safe and reliable production. We are developing new, pioneering carbon-free and low-carbon production processes for our products. We are accelerating our innovation processes and deepening cooperation with customers, suppliers and other  partners to develop high-performance products with a lower carbon  footprint. We are developing recycling technologies for various waste streams to strengthen the circular economy. We are harnessing the many opportunities of digitalization across all areas of the company. We are systematically aligning our portfolio with growth areas and future technologies, and are integrating sustainability into our value chains even more strongly. We create a working environment in which our employees can thrive and contribute to BASF's long-term success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our strategic action areas, see page 28 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In this section:\n\nStrategic Action Areas Values and Global Standards Business Models of the Segments Targets and Target Achievement 2022 Investments and Portfolio Measures Steering Concept Sustainability Concept Innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our customers in focus\n\nBASF supplies products and services to around 82,000 customers from almost all sectors and countries around the world. Our customers  are  mainly  global  and  small  and  medium-sized companies, but also include end consumers. We are continually refining  our  organizational  structure  so  that  our  operating divisions  can  flexibly  address  specific  market  and  customer requirements and differentiate themselves from the competition. The operating divisions pursue different business strategies from  cost  leadership  in  basic  chemicals  to  tailored  system solutions for specific customer applications. Above and beyond this, we are intensifying cooperation with our customers to  jointly leverage innovation and growth potential. For instance, we have established around 60 strategic customer networks to address the needs of our most important customers even better and more quickly.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenewable energy is a central building block on BASF's journey to climate neutrality. To enable us to meet our growing demand in the future, we are gradually switching our supply agreements to green power and investing in our own plants. One example is the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm currently under construction, which has a total capacity of 1.5 gigawatts.\n\nMaterial topics in focus:\n\n## Climate Change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st century. Swift and resolute action is needed to ensure that the targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement can be achieved. We stand by this  responsibility. In many areas, products and  innovations based on chemistry are the key to a climate- neutral future - from insulation foams for energy-efficient buildings, lightweight construction  components and battery materials for e-mobility to sustainable agriculture.\n\nAt the same time, we are working intensively to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our production and thus of our products. Our target: Net zero emissions by 2050. 1 We have set ourselves an ambitious milestone on this path. By 2030, we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2018 - while growing production volumes in parallel. Compared with 1990, this would translate into a reduction of around 60%. We are intensely pursuing our climate protection targets with investments of up to \u20ac4/uni00A0billion by 2030. Our focus here is on five strategic levers:\n\n- -Grey-to-green: We are increasingly meeting our electricity needs from renewable sources. In 2022, the share of green power was 16%.\n- -Power-to-steam: In the future, we will increasingly rely on electrification and energy recovery in steam generation, for example, through the use of heat pumps or e-boilers.\n- -New technologies: We are developing pioneering carbon-free and low-carbon production processes, especially for emis sionintensive basic chemicals such as hydrogen, olefins and  aromatics.\n- -Bio-based  feedstocks: We  are  increasingly  replacing  fossil resources with alternative raw materials. In 2022, for example, we procured around 1.2/uni00A0 million metric tons of renewable raw materials.\n- -Continuous opex: We are working to further improve the energy and  process  efficiency  of  our  plants.  In  2022  alone,  BASF implemented more than 500 operational excellence measures.\n\nWe want to play an active and responsible role in shaping the transformation toward a climate-neutral society. This also requires\n\na/uni00A0  political and regulatory environment that promotes innovation in climate protection, makes it possible to develop new processes that are competitive internationally and, above all, resolutely drives forward  the  expansion  of  renewable  energies.  Initial  estimates suggest that at the Lud wigs hafen site in Germany alone, we would need three to four times more green electricity than in 2021 to fully implement new, low-carbon electricity-based production processes. To meet this  demand, we are investing in our own power assets and are increasingly buying green electricity on the market (make & buy approach).\n\nWe are also addressing the question of how climate change affects our sites. In Ludwigshafen, for example, we have been  implementing a range of climate resilience measures for dealing with low water levels on the Rhine River since 2018, including an early warning system, multimodal transportation concepts, smarter management of cooling water and the development of an innovative type of barge for very low water levels. These measures already proved successful during the dry period in summer 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on energy and climate protection, see page 135 onward\n\n## Our global climate protection targets\n\n## -25%\n\nReduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2018 1\n\n## Net zero\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 1\n\n1  Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties, including offsetting)",

We  continuously  monitor  global  trends  and short-term  developments  and  anticipate  the  resulting oppor tunities and risks. The following six strategic action areas enable us to focus on our customers while strength ening our leading posi tion in a competitive environment.\n\n## Innovation\n\nInnovation is the bedrock of our success. BASF is a leader in the chemical industry with around 10,000 employees in research and development and R&D spending of around \u20ac2.3 billion. We want to expand  this  position  by  strengthening  our  research  activities, especially in battery materials, polymer technologies and catalytic and biotechnological methods (see box on the right). In addition, we are  expanding  our  cooperation  with  customers,  universities, research institutions and other partners.\n\nWe reorganized our global research activities in 2022. Business and application-driven units that were previously part of three research divisions were integrated into the operating divisions, aligning them more closely with the needs of our customers. For greater efficiency and effectiveness, we have bundled research activities that are relevant to several operating divisions in the new cross-functional and  cross-regional  Group  Research  unit.  This  global  research division supports our operating divisions' customer-specific R&D activities. It also drives forward cross-divisional projects on topics relevant to the entire Group, such as avoiding CO2 in chemical processes and products, energy efficiency and recycling technologies.\n\nOur innovation pipeline is geared to sustainability - especially climate protection and the circular economy. This lays the  foundation for  future  growth:  We  are  working  intensively  on  fundamental innovations  for  products,  processes  and  business  models,  for example, for the chemical recycling of plastics, battery and catalyst\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Driving sustainability with microorganisms\n\nWith its broad technological expertise, BASF is well positioned to/uni00A0 develop innovative solutions for a sustainable future. One of our/uni00A0key technologies is white biotechnology. White biotechnology enables us to produce a wide range of products using a variety of/uni00A0 feedstocks  in  an  efficient,  resource-conserving  and  flexible manner: biopolymers, essential ingredients for human and animal nutrition,  crop  protection  products,  flavors  and  fragrances,  or ingredients for cosmetics. We also produce enzymes from fungi and bacteria for use in detergents. One example is BASF's proteincleaving enzyme Lavergy \u00ae Pro, which removes tough stains even at low temperatures and in short wash cycles, thus saving energy and water.\n\nMicroorganisms are not just used to manufacture products, but at/uni00A0 the end of the product life cycle as well. We are working to understand  how  microorganisms  metabolize  complex  organic\n\ncompounds  into  energy,  water,  carbon  dioxide  and  biomass. A/uni00A0 fundamental  understanding  of  such  biological  processes  is needed to use this natural method and develop biodegradable products. In addition, digital tools are an important component of the research work to predict the properties and biodegradability of molecules and materials at a very early stage of product development, enabling their structures to be adapted accordingly. This is important for products that end up in wastewater treatment plants at the end of their life cycles, such as cosmetics, laundry  detergents and  dishwashing  products.  Another  example  is  our  certified biodegradable biopolymer ecovio \u00ae . This can be used to produce mulch films that can be plowed under after use in the field and completely metabolized by microorganisms.",

At the same time, we are developing product improvements  in  all  business  units  that  offer  our  customers sustainability and competitive advantages. These include surface solutions for the aviation and wind power industries, bio-based and bio degrad able active  ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent and cleaner industries, and engineering plastics based on renewable raw materials.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 49 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe believe that the economy, environment and society are inextricably linked and interrelated. We want to create value in all three areas with our products, solutions and technologies. We pledged our commitment to sustainability in 1994 and since then, have system atically aligned our activities with the principles of sustainability. We want to further strengthen our position as a pioneer for sustainable solutions. We see sustainability as an integral part of our strategy as/uni00A0 well as our targets, steering processes and business models. In  doing so, our aim is to be a responsible and attractive partner for our customers, develop new growth areas and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company. Our approach covers the entire value chain - from the responsible procurement of our raw materials and safety and resource efficiency in production to sustainable  solutions for our customers.\n\nProtecting the climate is of central importance for us here. Since 1990, we have more than halved our carbon emissions while simultaneously doubling sales product volumes. By 2030, we want to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 and will invest up to \u20ac4 billion to this end. By 2050, we aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases. We are pursuing ambitious   climate protection targets with our carbon management. This comprises five strategic levers that we are systematically driving forward to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions (see page 27).\n\nIn the future, we want to align our product portfolio even more strongly with climate protection, carbon neutrality and circularity in order to meet the growing sustainability demands in our markets with innovative solutions. That is why we are updating our Sustainable  Solution  Steering  methodology  for  steering  the product port folio based on sustainability criteria (see page 45). We will  apply the new methodology for the first time in the 2023 business year. In addition, a digital solution enables us to calculate the carbon footprint  of  our  approximately  45,000  sales  products  -  from  raw materials  extraction  to  the  factory  gate  ('cradle-to-gate').  This creates transparency around the carbon intensity of our products and at the same time provides important starting points for reducing  greenhouse gas emissions along our value chains.\n\n- For more information on energy and climate protection and our carbon footprint, see page 135 onward For more information on the circular economy, see page 43 onward\n\n## Production\n\nOur core business is the production and processing of chemicals. Our strength here lies in the Verbund and its integrated value chains. This enables us to achieve efficient, reliable and CO2-optimized production and leverages synergies in the development and application of new technologies and the use of digital solutions. At the same time, the Verbund is the foundation for meeting the increasingly  diverse needs of our customers and markets with a differentiated offering. Our comprehensive product portfolio ranges from basic chemicals to custom system solutions.\n\nOur strategy is to produce locally for local markets, close to our customers. We plan to invest \u20ac28.8 billion worldwide between now and 2027 to expand our capacities based on market demand and to further increase the availability, efficiency and flexibility of our plants. In particular, we want to benefit from the strong growth of the chemical market in Asia (see 'Portfolio'). Our global production footprint contributes to the regional diversification of our sales and earnings distribution, making it part of our risk management. It helps us to compensate for economic weaknesses and a lack of growth\n\nprospects  in  individual  markets  within  the  BASF  Group.  This currently applies to Europe and especially Germany, where high natural gas prices and a challenging regulatory environment are negatively impacting our competitiveness and our growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our production sites and the Verbund structure, see page 20 onward\n\n## Digitalization\n\nWe want to leverage the diverse growth potential of digitalization, seize the associated opportunities to the benefit of our customers and strengthen our competitiveness. To achieve this, we promote digital skills among our employees, cooperate with partners and make digital technologies and ways of working an integral part of our business.\n\nDigitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us/uni00A0 to further automate processes and in this way, manage the capacity, availability and efficiency of our plants in line with market conditions, for example, by simulating value streams within our Verbund structure or through predictive maintenance. Linking data from different sources and using artificial intelligence for smart data analysis opens up numerous opportunities for us to manage our business more  efficiently and improve our processes, for example, in/uni00A0logistics.\n\nThe combination of products, services and digital offerings also creates new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in agriculture or the personal care industry. In addition, digitalization enables us to further strengthen our innovative power. BASF has one of the most powerful supercomputers in the chemical industry - Quriosity. We use it to accelerate complex computing processes such as the simulation of molecules, for example. At the same time, we are working on groundbreaking technologies such as/uni00A0 quantum computing, including as a founding member of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC). We are also involved in other digitalization initiatives such as the Catena-X",

Following major acquisitions (battery materials, engineering plastics, farming solutions) and divestitures (pigments, construction chemicals, paper and water chemicals) in recent years, we continued on this course in  2022  with  divestitures  and  division-specific  partnerships.  As planned, we divested the kaolin minerals business to KaMin and the attapulgite business to Clariant.\n\nAt the same time, we are strengthening the basis for our organic growth  with  investments.  In  North  America,  for  example,  we launched the third and final phase of the MDI expansion at the Geismar site in Louisiana in 2022. Examples in Europe include the construction of a new hexamethylenediamine (HMD) plant at our site in Chalamp\u00e9, France, and the expansion of our polyamide 6.6 production in Freiburg, Germany. A new world-scale production plant for alkylethanolamines will be built at the Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium, by 2024. The Asian market will play a key role in our future growth. With a share of more than 45%, China is already by far the world's largest chemical market and is a key driver of growth in global chemical production. We have a strong production, sales and innovation base in Asia, and in particular in China , which we will continue to expand. Our largest project is the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. We  granted  final  approval  for  its  construction  in  2022.  Once completed,  it  will  be  BASF's  third-largest  Verbund  site  after Ludwigshafen,  Germany,  and  Antwerp,  Belgium.  Following  the successful startup of the first plant for the production of engineering plastics in August 2022, the focus in Zhanjiang is now on the step-by-step  establishment of the Verbund structure, starting with the construction of a/uni00A0steam cracker along with downstream plants for the production of/uni00A0 petrochemicals and intermediates. Work is\n\nalso underway to  complete a plant for thermoplastic polyurethanes and to build a plant for neopentyl glycol. In addition, the expansion of  our  Verbund  site  in  Nanjing,  China,  operated  together  with Sinopec, started  operation in 2022. New plants for products from the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions will be built there by the end of 2023.\n\nWe also further expanded our global battery materials business in 2022.  This  includes  investments  to  increase  our  production capacities and to establish innovative recycling concepts in the three  key  regions  of  Europe,  North  America  and  Asia.  At  the Schwarzheide site in Germany, we started the multi-step com mission ing  process  for  a  new  production  plant  for  cathode  active materials 1 at the end of 2022, as planned. We are also building a prototype plant for battery recycling in Schwarzheide, 1 which is scheduled for startup in 2023, as well as a plant for the production of black mass from batteries on a  commercial scale (planned startup: 2024). We are working on the integration of our production site in Harjavalta,  Finland, 2 which  supplies precursors for cathode active materials. Alongside our  existing sites in North America, we are looking into investing in a new production site for cathode active materials and battery recycling in B\u00e9cancour, Canada. The new site allows for ample space to expand up to 100 kilotons of cathode active  materials per year with potential for fully integrated precursor cathode active materials supply. We are also currently expanding the capacity of BASF Shanshan  Battery/uni00A0 Materials Co., Ltd. in China to 100 kilotons per year. The multi-step commissioning process  for  the  new  production  lines  at  the   Changsha  and Shizuishan sites started in late 2022 as planned. In Onoda, Japan, work to expand production capacities for cathode active materials at BASF TODA Battery Materials LLC has also been underway since the end of 2022. This is scheduled for startup in the second half of 2024. Our production facilities in all key regions and growing capacities  enable  us  to  serve  battery  cell  and  automotive\n\nmanufacturers in all relevant markets even more extensively with tailored and sustainable solutions.\n\nFor more information on material investments and portfolio measures, see page 37 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees\n\nOur employees are key to BASF's success. That is why we believe that it is important to have an attractive total offer package and an inspiring working environment that fosters and develops employees' individual talents and enables them and their teams to perform at their best. We are pursuing three action areas to make our highperformance organization even more so: empowerment, differentiation and simplification of structures and processes. At the same time, we encourage and promote a leadership culture that  empowers our employees to respond to customer needs quickly and efficiently with a solution orientation. We value diversity in people, opinions and experience as being crucial to creativity and innovation. We embrace bold ideas, help our employees to implement them and learn from setbacks.

        "page_content": "## Agricultural Solutions\n\nIn the Agricultural Solutions segment, we are working to achieve the right balance between economic, environmental and social value creation for a sustainable and efficient agricultural sector. Efficient farming is fundamental given that the world's population is  expected to increase by about two billion 1 people between 2022 and 2050. While the demand for food, feed, fiber and energy is growing, natural resources are limited. Balanced agriculture is a key enabler in/uni00A0producing enough healthy, affordable food and responding to changing consumer behavior while reducing the impact on the  environment.\n\nAs one of the world's leading agricultural solutions companies, we are making a positive impact on sustainable agriculture and food systems. Our innovation-driven strategy for agriculture focuses on selected crops and their appropriate cultivation systems in specific regions. We integrate sustainability criteria into all business and portfolio decisions. In doing so, we help farmers achieve better yield, protect the planet and produce economically.\n\nWe leverage our expertise in research and development and our deep understanding of the way individual growers manage their farms to provide offers across technologies. These include novel solutions for seeds, traits, crop protection and digital products tailored to the farming needs of their region and crop systems.\n\n## Good to know\n\nWe are committed to sustainable farming to help farmers not only produce more, but also better. We focus on four areas in  particular:\n\nClimate-smart farming: We help farmers tackle the pressing challenges of climate change with the right combination of technologies designed to increase yield even under changing climatic conditions, make farm management easier and more effective, and at the same time, reduce the impact on the environment. Our technologies include products that enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions, for example, nitrogen management products to improve fertilizer efficiency, or  herbicides that facilitate conservation tillage. Moreover, we develop seeds and traits for more stress-resilient crops and are working on using bacteria to improve nitrogen availability to plants.\n\nSustainable solutions: We systematically steer our innovation pipeline according to sustainability criteria from an early stage. This  enables  us  to  continually  develop  innovations  that  offer added value for farmers, the environment and society. We also assess each product in our portfolio with respect to its  contribution to sustainability. This is one of the levers we use to system atically steer our portfolio to increase our substantial contribution to sustainability.\n\nDigital farming: Digitalization will transform agriculture and make it more resource-efficient and sustainable. Our digital farming solutions help farmers to produce more with less and grow their business profitably while improving their environmental footprint.\n\nSmart  stewardship: Our  tools  and  services  are  tailored  to farmers' daily work. Farmers get the support they need to use our/uni00A0 products safely: access to tools and services, protective equipment,  customized training, digital solutions and new and future- oriented application technologies such as drones.",

That is why we  pursue ambitious targets along our entire value chain. We report transparently on target achievement so that our stakeholders can track our progress.\n\nOur objective is profitable growth: We want to grow sales volumes faster than global chemical production, further increase our profitability, achieve a return on capital employed (ROCE) considerably above the cost of capital percentage and increase the dividend per share every year based on a strong free cash flow.\n\nIn addition to these financial targets, we have set ourselves broad sustainability targets. We want to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions in the coming years and align our product portfolio even more strongly with climate protection and the circular economy. To achieve this, we are updating the methodology used to assess our product portfolio against defined sustainability criteria and will apply it for the first time in 2023 (see page 45).

We want to further improve safety in production. Furthermore, we aim to promote diversity within the company and create a working environment in which our employees feel that they/uni00A0can thrive and perform at their best.\n\nThe objective of these targets is to steer our business into a more sustainable future, and at the same time, contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are focusing here on issues that we as a company can influence/uni00A0 - especially SDG/uni00A02 (Zero hunger), SDG/uni00A05 (Gender equality), SDG/uni00A06 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG/uni00A07 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG/uni00A08 ( Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG/uni00A013 (Climate action).\n\nFor more information on financial indicators, see page 52 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on sustainability along the value chain, see page/uni00A0100 onward\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Most important KPIs\n\nBASF has set itself ambitious targets along the value chain. Two of these indicators are particularly important:\n\n- - Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n- - Absolute CO2 emissions\n\nAs our most important key performance indicators (KPIs), these two metrics are the main indicators used to steer the BASF Group. We also use ROCE for employee incentivization throughout the Group. The achievement of climate protection targets also  influences the compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors and senior executives.\n\n- For more information on the steering concept, see page 41 onward\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors,\n\nsee basf.com/compensationreport",

In 2022, we moved forward with the further expansion of the site in Nanjing, China, together with our partner Sinopec to strengthen the joint production of chemical products in China. For instance, we are currently expanding  our  production  capacities  for  propionic aldehyde, propionic acid, purified ethylene oxide, ethanolamines and ethyleneamines, and are building a new tert-butyl acrylate plant. The new and expanded plants are scheduled to come onstream in/uni00A02023.\n\nWe are building another Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. In July 2022, BASF granted final approval for construction. The site will be constructed in several phases. A steam cracker and several downstream plants for the production  of  petrochemicals  and  intermediates,  among  other products, are currently being built. As part of the Verbund, these plants should be operational from late 2025.\n\nWe  are  expanding  the  2-ethylhexanoic  acid  plant  in  Kuantan, Malaysia, with our partner PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad. Startup is planned for 2024.\n\nAt  our  Verbund  site  in  Antwerp,  Belgium,  we  are  significantly expanding  our  ethylene  oxide  plant.  The  project  also  includes several downstream plants, for example, to produce alkylethanolamines and surfactants. The expanded ethylene oxide capacities are scheduled to come onstream in 2023.\n\n## Materials\n\nIn the Materials segment, the expansion of the methylene diphenyl diisocyanate  (MDI)  plant  in  Geismar,  Louisiana,  continued  as planned. The final expansion will increase production capacity to approximately 600,000 metric tons per year to support the growth\n\n| Segment                 | Location

        "page_content": "of BASF's North American MDI customers. Including the first and second phases, the investment volume totals around $1/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe first plant at the smart Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, started up in August 2022. It has a capacity of 60,000/uni00A0 metric tons of engineering plastics compounds per year, bringing BASF's total capacity of engineering plastics in Asia Pacific to 420,000 metric tons. The new plant enables BASF to meet the growing demand from its customers, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries. The next startup in Zhanjiang is planned for 2023: a plant for the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU).\n\nIn  Europe,  BASF  is  investing  in  a  new  world-scale  production plant for hexamethylenediamine (HMD) at the Chalamp\u00e9 site in France. The new plant, which is scheduled to start operations in 2024, will increase BASF's annual HMD production capacity to 260,000/uni00A0metric tons.\n\n## Industrial/uni00A0Solutions\n\nAt the Jurong site in Singapore, we expanded global production capacity for the antioxidant Irganox \u00ae 1010. With the completion of the project in 2022, BASF can now better serve the growing  demand from customers in Asia and the Middle East. In addition, BASF is investing in production capacity for hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS)  at  its  sites  in  Lampertheim,  Germany,  and  Pontecchio Marconi, Italy. As part of a multi-step investment plan, BASF aims to serve  the  growing  demand  for  light  stabilizers  used  in  durable plastics applications and increase supply security for customers worldwide.\n\nTo ensure the supply of high-quality dispersions solutions for the South Asian market, we are expanding our dispersions capacities in Huizhou,  China,  with  an  additional  production  line.  Startup  is expected in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nWe aim to expand our position as a leading and innovative provider of battery materials and recycling solutions and expect to benefit from the strong growth in this market segment. A global, customerfocused production network for battery materials is crucial here. Construction  of  our  production  plant  for  cathode  materials  in Schwarz heide, Germany, continued in 2022. It is scheduled to start commercial production in 2023. We are working on the  integration of our production site in Harjavalta, Finland, which will  supply  precursors for cathode active materials. The two plants will initially produce cathode active materials for around 20/uni00A0 gigawatt hours of/uni00A0 cell capacity per year. With these investments in Finland and Germany, BASF aims to become the first cathode active  materials supplier with local production capacities in all of what are currently the main markets: China, Japan, North America and  Europe.\n\nIn addition, the construction of our new battery recycling prototype plant in Schwarzheide continued on schedule in 2022. Startup is planned for 2023. The prototype plant will allow for the development of operating procedures and optimization of  technology to deliver superior returns of lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from endof-life lithium-ion batteries and unused process materials.\n\n## Nutrition/uni00A0& Care\n\nThe expansion of the vitamin/uni00A0 A acetate plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, was completed in 2021. BASF is now strengthening its market position for vitamin/uni00A0A for the animal nutrition industry with the expansion of its world-scale formulation capacities at its Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, which began in 2021. Startup is planned for mid-2023. We also invested in the expansion of alkoxylate  capacities at the Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, BASF started up the new methane sulfonic  acid  plant  at  its  Verbund  site  in  Ludwigshafen.  This increases BASF's methane sulfonic acid capacities from 30,000 to\n\n50,000/uni00A0 metric tons per year in response to growing  cross-industry demand, strengthening its position as a leading global producer.\n\n## Agricultural Solutions\n\nThe investment in a formulation hub for crop protection products in Singapore, which started up in 2022, ensures that multiple formulation technologies are produced close to farmers in Asia Pacific. In North America, we continued to modernize site infrastructure and completed this on schedule. We are also investing in the traceability of agrochemicals based on digital identification in Europe. Further investments are being made to reduce CO2 emissions and organic waste in our plants. Between 2023 and 2027, we plan to invest around \u20ac1/uni00A0billion in developing and expanding our plants and infrastructure, including state-of-the-art R&D facilities, and in our production and formulation capacities for active  ingredients as well as for seed solutions to meet our continuing high demand for our innovative solutions in the future.\n\nFor more information on our segments, see page 72 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our Steering Concept\n\nFor us, creating long-term value as a company means generating earnings that consistently exceed the cost of capital employed. We encourage and support all employees in thinking and acting entrepreneurially. Both financial and nonfinancial aspects are an integral part of our value-based  management. That is why we have established most important key performance indicators that cover both areas: return on capital employed (ROCE) and CO2 emissions.\n\nOur financial targets follow a steering concept that is aligned with our values. The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as the key target and management indicator for the BASF/uni00A0Group. In line with our strategic targets, we aim to achieve a ROCE considerably above the cost of capital percentage every year. With ROCE, the same  data  is  used  for  our  value-based  management,  external communication with the capital markets and variable compensation. This means we use the same yardstick for internal management, employee incentivization and our shareholders' expectations.\n\nAs part of our corporate strategy, our target is to reduce our  absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030. We aim to achieve net zero emissions (Scope/uni00A01 and Scope/uni00A02) by 2050. Consequently, CO2 emissions are defined as a steering-relevant indicator, and we report on them as the most important nonfinancial key performance  indicator.\n\n## Calculating ROCE and cost of capital\n\nROCE is calculated as the EBIT of the segments as a percentage of the average cost of capital basis.\n\nTo calculate the EBIT of the segments , we take the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other, which are not allocated to the divisions.\n\nThe cost of capital basis is calculated using the month-end figures and  consists  of  the  operating  assets  of  the  segments.  These comprise the current and noncurrent asset items of the segments, including tangible and intangible fixed assets, integral investments accounted for using the equity method, inventories, trade accounts receivable, other receivables and other assets generated by core business activities and, where appropriate, the assets of disposal groups.  The  cost  of  capital  basis  also  includes  customer  and supplier  financing.\n\nWe have integrated the cost of capital percentage into our ROCE target as a comparative figure. This is determined using the  weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs (weighted average cost of capital, WACC). To calculate a pre-tax figure similar to EBIT, the cost of capital is adjusted using the projected tax rate for the BASF/uni00A0 Group for the business year. In addition, the projected net expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment to the cost of capital percentage. The cost of equity is ascertained using the capital asset pricing model. Borrowing costs are determined based on the financing costs of the BASF Group. The cost of capital percentage for 2023 is 9% (2022: 9%).\n\n## Calculation of CO2 emissions\n\nWe calculate the BASF/uni00A0 Group's absolute CO2 emissions on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions, which are the sum of direct emissions from production processes and the generation of steam and electricity (Scope/uni00A0 1), as well as indirect emissions from the purchase of energy (Scope/uni00A02). Direct emissions from the generation of  energy  for  third  parties  are  not  considered  here.  Relevant emissions include other greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2   equivalents.\n\nFor more information on our CO2 emissions and climate protection targets, see page/uni00A0135 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value-based management throughout the company\n\nThe target agreement process is an important part of our  value-based management.  It  aligns  individual  employee  targets  with  BASF's targets. The most important financial indicator in the operating business is ROCE. The other units' contribution to value is also assessed according to effectiveness and efficiency on the basis of quality and cost targets. To assess this, we use metrics such as BASF's internal service score in the service units.",

        "page_content": "For the BASF/uni00A0Group, we use EBIT before special items and capex (capital expenditure) as key performance indicators that have a direct impact on ROCE and as such, support its management.\n\n- -EBIT before special items is used to steer profitability at Group and  segment  level.  This  is  calculated  by  adjusting  the  EBIT reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements for special items,  making  it  especially  suitable  for  assessing  economic development over time. Special items arise from the integration of  acquired  businesses,  from  restructuring  measures,  certain impairments, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities.\n- -Capital  expenditures (capex)  are  used  to  manage  capital employed in the BASF/uni00A0 Group. These comprise additions to property, plant and equipment excluding additions from acquisitions,  IT  investments,  restoration  obligations  and  right-of-use assets arising from leases. Capex is not just relevant to ROCE management but also supports our long-term goal of increasing our dividend each year based on a strong free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, we comment on and forecast sales at Group and segment level in our financial reporting as a significant driver for EBIT before special items and thus ROCE.\n\nFor more information on the development of these indicators, see page/uni00A056 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

That is why BASF teams are working on innovative processes to recycle lithium-ion batteries. This produces a substance known as 'black mass' (see photo), from which high-purity lithium salt as well as nickel, cobalt and manganese can be recovered.\n\nMaterial topics in focus:\n\n## Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3, 301, 304, 306\n\nAs the world's population grows, so does demand for limited natural resources. At the same time, many valuable  materials end up in landfills or in waste incineration. New concepts are needed to decouple growth from resource  consumption. Reduce, reuse and recycle are the keywords of this transition to a system of more sustainable product cycles with less resource consumption and lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe concept of conserving resources, recycling and feeding waste back into the system has been firmly anchored in our company since BASF was founded in 1865: At that time, Friedrich Engelhorn pursued the idea of producing synthetic dyes from coal tar - a waste product - and organizing production as efficiently as possible. We have stayed true to this tradition to this day and are aligning our actions with circularity more systematically than ever. For example, BASF's Verbund structure presents numerous opportunities for a circular economy: By intelligently networking our plants, we can use by-products from one plant elsewhere as feedstocks or energy, which reduces our overall resource consumption (see pages 135 and 142).\n\nWe want to further reduce our resource and carbon footprint, which is why we are aligning our feedstock base even more strongly with non-fossil alternatives such as bio-based or renewable raw materials. To expand our supply base, we are also  developing additional  waste-based  sources  of  raw  materials  and  suitable recycling processes, often with partners (see page 120). Our target here is to process 250,000/uni00A0metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials/uni00A0 - such as pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or used tires/uni00A0- in our production plants annually from 2025.\n\nMany of BASF's products and technologies are already helping to close loops at many points along the value chain. Together with our customers and other stakeholders, we want to further accelerate the transformation from linear to circular business models. Our\n\ntarget: By 2030, we want to double our sales of solutions for the circular economy to \u20ac17/uni00A0billion (baseline: 2020). These include:\n\n- -Products based on renewable or recycled raw materials: These include products manufactured in whole or in part from renewable resources instead of fossil raw materials. The  alternative raw materials are allocated to the end product using what is known as the mass balance approach. This is verified and certified by independent third parties (see box on page 121). We use this approach for selected ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent, cleaner and food industries, for example (see page 118). Other examples are products that contain mechanically recycled raw materials (Mcycled) or products based on chemically recycled pyrolysis oil (Ccycled products, see page 120).\n- -Products that close material cycles ('close the loop'): These include products that enable and improve the recyclability of valuable resources. Our first focus area here is the value chain for/uni00A0 plastics (see page/uni00A0 51). Examples include our certified compostable  plastics  ecoflex \u00ae and  ecovio \u00ae ,  plastic  additives  for improved mechanical recycling, or catalysts and adsorbents for the purification and treatment of recycled raw materials. The second focus is recycling mineral raw materials. For example, together with partners we are driving forward innovative technologies and solutions for recovering metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from spent lithium-ion batteries (see page 120).",

        "page_content": "- -Products that increase the resource efficiency or lifespan of materials  ('extend  the  loop'): These  include  products  that reduce resource consumption and environmental impact along the value chain. One example is Oxsilan \u00ae , an innovative thin-film technology for protecting metals from corrosion, for example before painting. The process not only enables higher productivity with lower material use, but also offers a favorable safety, health and environmental profile compared with conventional phosphating processes. This category also includes products that  extend  service  life  and/or  reduce  maintenance  intervals. Tinuvin \u00ae light stabilizers are one example of this. They extend the lifespan of products such as agricultural films by providing reliable protection against UV radiation, heat and agrochemicals.\n\nOne of the steps we have taken to meet our targets and accelerate the transformation is establishing a company-wide Circular Economy Program. As part of this program, BASF teams are currently developing new approaches within three main action areas and over 45/uni00A0initiatives: alternative raw materials pathways, innovative material cycles and new business models for the circular economy - which also include digital and service-based concepts. We also cooperate with partners along the value chain and are involved in numerous networks, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Global Battery Alliance and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Through this, we want to better understand needs, trends and growth  opportunities, and contribute to the development of standards. One example is the/uni00A0 mass balance concept, which we believe is key to the circular economy and the use of alternative raw materials in the chemical industry (see page 121).\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rethinking electromobility: the oli concept car\n\nThe oli [all-\u00eb] co-creation project from Citro\u00ebn and BASF shows how electric vehicles can save weight and conserve resources through elimination, reduction and the use of innovative materials. Teams from both companies worked together to put various components and materials into new contexts for the concept car, which was unveiled in September 2022. Many of the components are designed and manufactured from materials from the same chemical product family. This makes them easier to recycle at the end of their useful life.\n\nFor example, the complete backrest is made of Ultrasint \u00ae , a flexible 3D-printed plastic material from BASF. The open lattice structure also provides natural air flow, replacing all ventilators in the seat. Engineering plastics from BASF replace conventional materials such as metal in many other parts of the vehicle interior and exterior, which significantly reduces weight while opening up a wide range of design options. The accelerator and brake pedals are made of Ultramid \u00ae , for example. The center console is made of Elastollan \u00ae . BASF also offers both materials based on renewable\n\nand recycled raw materials. The hood, roof, and trunk are made of panels combining the Elastoflex \u00ae polyurethane system and the Elastocoat \u00ae spray paint system. The panels are lightweight and extremely stable thanks to a honeycomb sandwich structure.\n\nThe car body was coated using R-M \u00ae AGILIS \u00ae , a water-based coating with a very low content of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). BASF CathoGuard \u00ae 800 protects the battery housing from corrosion. The electrocoating enables resource-efficient processes and stands out for its eco-friendliness: It is tin/HAPs-free with low solvent content.\n\nCapping the top speed at 110/uni00A0km/h (68/uni00A0mph) and limiting acceleration significantly improves oli's range and battery lifespan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Discover the oli concept car at concept-car-citroen.basf.com",

We secure our long-term success with products, solutions and technologies that create value added for the environment, society and the economy.\n\n## Our strategic approach\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Sustainability aspects integrated into corporate steering\n- /uni25AA Targets for climate protection, circular economy, procurement, safety and employees\n- /uni25AA Strategic guidelines on stakeholder management and our societal  engagement\n- /uni25AA Chief Human Rights Officer appointed to further embed human rights aspects in decision-making processes\n\nSustainability is at the core of what we do and a driver for growth and value. Analyzing our contributions to sustainability also enables us to manage risks effectively. We pursue a holistic sustainability approach that covers the entire value chain - from our suppliers and our  own  activities  to  our  customers.  We  have  formulated commitments for our conduct along the value chain and  underpinned these with corresponding targets and measures (see page 36).\n\nBased on our corporate strategy, we steer the global sustainability target for climate protection via the most important key  performance indicator (KPI) 'absolute CO2 emissions' 1 (see page 35). To this end, we have established the necessary steering mechanisms and control systems at Group level, for example, by intensifying training and/uni00A0providing further support for decentralized implementation. Our\n\nactivities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include using renewable energies for both electricity and steam production, developing and applying new low-carbon production processes, using renewable raw materials, and ongoing measures to further increase energy and resource efficiency in our production (see page/uni00A0135). We have also set up a project organization to achieve our climate protection targets. The Net Zero Accelerator unit concentrates on implementing and accelerating projects on low-carbon production technologies, the circular economy and  renewable  energies.\n\nIn addition to this climate protection target, we have set further sustainability  targets,  for  example,  on  responsible  procurement, resource-efficient and safe production, engaged employees and diversity.\n\nWe want to offer our customers innovative products and solutions that support their sustainability goals. That is why we ensure that the business  units  continuously  monitor  and  evaluate  relevant sustainability aspects. These evaluations are taken into account in strategies,  in  the  implementation  of  research  projects  and  in innovation processes, among other things.\n\nA significant steering tool for the product portfolio, based on the sustainability  performance  of  our  products,  is  the Sustainable Solution Steering method. This rates our products' applications in the relevant markets and customer industries. If, during  reassessment of our portfolio, we identify products with significant sustainability\n\nconcerns, we classify these as 'challenged.' We develop and systematically  implement  action  plans  for  all  products  in  this category. These include research projects and reformulations to optimize products, or even replacing the product with an alternative. To rigorously align our portfolio with contributions to sustainability, in 2018 we started phasing out all Challenged products within five years of their initial classification as 'challenged' at the latest. A particular  focus  in  the  continued  development  of  our  product portfolio  is  on  products  that  make  a  substantial  sustainability contribution in the value chain. These include products that make positive contributions to areas such as health and safety, reducing emissions and the circular economy.\n\nOur target of generating \u20ac22/uni00A0 billion in Accelerator sales by 2025, which was based on our corporate strategy, was already achieved in 2021 with sales of \u20ac24.1/uni00A0billion. In order to address the growing sustainability requirements in our markets with innovative solutions, we want to align our product portfolio even more strongly with climate protection, climate neutrality and the circular economy going forward. That is why we are updating our methodology and our product portfolio steering target and will introduce a revised method in 2023.\n\nAs a co-founder of the U.N. Global Compact, we contribute to the implementation of the United Nations' (U.N.) Agenda/uni00A0 2030. Our products,  solutions  and  technologies  help  to  achieve  the  U.N.

To prioritize the SDGs relevant  to  BASF,  in  2022  internal  experts  again  assessed  the impacts and positive contributions of our products, our corporate targets and strategic action areas.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out an improved materiality analysis that already  focuses  on  the  double  materiality  required  by  future regulations. This identified both sustainability topics on which we have a potentially positive or negative impact through our business activities along the value chain, and those topics that have or could have a positive or negative impact on the company's performance. The graphic on this page illustrates our approach and the  dimensions of double materiality.\n\nIn the first step, external developments and data were evaluated in order to prioritize topics. These included competitor and customer activities,  relevant  standards  and  regulations,  and  other  trends relating to sustainability. The 48/uni00A0topics identified in this step were then evaluated based on their importance for the chemical industry and the requirements and expectations of our stakeholders (such as customers, suppliers, competitors, investors and NGOs) using big data tools and further prioritized as the next step.\n\nThe core topics identified were then assessed in terms of their double  materiality  for  BASF.  Each  sustainability  aspect  was considered from two perspectives: To assess sustainability  relevance ('impact materiality'), both the actual and the potential positive and negative impacts of our company's activities were considered along three stages of the value chain (upstream, own operations, downstream). Here, we assessed the scale of impact, its scope and likelihood of occurrence. The individual topics were classified based on their potential financial impacts on BASF as part of the financial materiality analysis. Specifically, we analyzed how each  sustainability aspect affects us geographically, for example, whether a local business unit or entire regions are affected, whether it impacts our production, our employees, meeting the targets we have set for the\n\n## Identifying and assessing sustainability topics a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na Material within the meaning of section/uni00A0289c HGB or relevant within the meaning of the Global Reporting Initiative\n\nBASF/uni00A0 Group, or our reputation. The results help us to better understand the complex and sometimes diverging requirements and expectations that our stakeholders have of us and to define strategically relevant topics for our long-term business success.\n\nA sustainability aspect is considered material in the sense of double materiality if it has been classified as material both at the level of sustainability relevance and at the level of financial relevance. Under the Global Reporting Initiative, a sustainability aspect is additionally already considered material if it has only been classified as material at the level of sustainability relevance. On this basis, the following 12/uni00A0topics were identified as material and confirmed by the  Corporate Sustainability Board:  waste, climate change adaptation,  biodiversity,\n\nbusiness  ethics,  occupational  health/uni00A0 &  safety,  climate  change mitigation, circularity and resource efficiency, plastic waste, human rights and labor rights, product stewardship, diversity, inclusion/uni00A0& equal work, and water/uni00A0& wastewater.\n\nFor more information on our materiality analysis, see basf.com/materiality\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together with decentrally organized specialists, the Corporate Strategy/uni00A0& Sustainability unit in the Corporate Center is responsible for integrating sustainability into core business activities and decision-making processes. The unit is also  responsible for the global steering of climate-related matters. Since January 2022, the Net Zero Accelerator unit has been driving forward new and  existing  projects,  focusing  on  further  acceleration  and implementation to achieve CO2 reduction targets worldwide. Both units report to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board are regularly  briefed  on  the  development  of  individual  sustainability topics. The Board of Executive Directors incorporates the results and recommendations from sustainability evaluations of business processes into its decisions, for example, on proposed investments and acquisitions. It makes decisions with strategic relevance for the Group and monitors the implementation of strategic plans and target achievement. The global climate protection target is linked to the compensation of the entire Board of Executive Directors and senior  executives  via  the  most  important  KPI  'absolute  CO2 emissions.' The Corporate Sustainability Board, which is composed of heads of business and Corporate Center units and regions, supports the Board of Executive Directors on sustainability topics and  discusses  operational  matters.  It  is  chaired  by  Board  of Executive Directors member Saori Dubourg.\n\nIn 2022, BASF appointed a Chief Human Rights Officer to further embed human rights aspects in decision-making processes. He reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors (see page 109).\n\nWe systematically evaluate sustainability criteria , including the effects of climate change, as an integral part of decisions on acquisitions and investments in property, plant and equipment or financial  assets.  In  this  way,  we  not  only  assess  economic dimensions, but also the potential impacts on areas such as the environment, human rights or the local community. We evaluate both the potential impacts of our activities here as well as which effects we are exposed to.\n\nIf we identify potential negative impacts or previously untapped opportunities to make a greater contribution, for example in planned investments,  these  are  presented  transparently  in  the  internal decision-making process and possible mitigation measures, such as changes in water management, are proposed.\n\nIn our Sustainable Finance Roundtable, we discuss topics relating to sustainable  finance.  Here,  experts  from  departments  such  as Finance, Corporate Strategy, and Investor Relations and Communications discuss new legal or capital market-driven requirements. The   interdisciplinary group analyzes the steadily growing requirements, assesses the impacts on BASF and drives forward the necessary  change processes as well as the concrete implementation of  measures.\n\n- For more information on our financial and sustainability targets, see pages 35 and 36\n- For more information on our risk management, see pages 157 to 167\n- For more information on the organization of our sustainability management,\n\nsee basf.com/sustainabilitymanagement\n\nFor more information on compensation structures, see the compensation report at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Measuring sustainable value added\n\nWe are aware that our business activities can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment and society. We aim to  increase our positive contributions and minimize the negative impacts of our business activities. To achieve this, we need to measure how our actions and our products impact the environment and society.\n\nWe  already  have  many  years  of  experience  in  this  area  from evaluating our products and processes using methods such as Eco-Efficiency  Analyses,  the  SEEbalance \u00ae Socio-Eco-Efficiency Analysis,  our  Sustainable  Solution  Steering  portfolio  analysis, BASF's corporate carbon footprint or the calculation of Product Carbon Footprints.\n\n## Our stakeholder management\n\nOur  stakeholders include customers, employees,  investors, suppliers, the communities surrounding our sites, and  representatives from industry, academia, politics and society. Parts of our business activities, such as the use of certain new technologies or our environmental impacts, are often viewed by stakeholders with a critical eye. We take these questions seriously, initiate dialogs and participate in discussions. We are in ongoing exchange with our stakeholders through a variety of formats. This helps us to even better understand what matters to groups of society, what they expect of us and which measures we can pursue in order to establish  and  maintain  trust,  build  partnerships,  and  increase societal  acceptance  for  and  the  sustainability  of  our  business activities.  For  important  topics,  we  systematically  identify  key stakeholders at an early stage to discuss critical questions with them.  Relevant  considerations  here  include  their  topic-specific expertise and willingness to engage in constructive dialog.",

As part of the ChemCycling TM project, BASF is working with partners on innovative recycling technologies and their  implementation on a commercial scale to enable these resources to be fed back into the system in the future, too.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaterial topics in focus:\n\n## Plastic Waste\n\nGRI 3\n\nPlastics are part of modern life. Whether in clothing or shoes, in mattresses or furniture, in smartphones or cars, in medicine or construction - they are used in almost all areas of life because of their beneficial properties. But plastics also come with challenges: Only 20% of the  approximately 250/uni00A0million metric tons of plastic waste generated worldwide each year is currently  recycled. At BASF, we are working to increase this number.\n\nPlastics are an important part of our product portfolio. This includes engineering  plastics,  polyurethanes,  biopolymers  and  styrene foams. Our products are mostly used in durable and demanding applications, such as automotive engineering, medical technology, electronics and electrical engineering, and building insulation.\n\nAs a responsible player in the value chain, we want to further  improve the sustainability performance of plastics throughout the entire life cycle - from the production and use of renewable and recycled raw materials (see page 43) through the use phase, where  innovative plastic  materials  ensure  greater  sustainability  in  areas  such  as mobility, construction or energy, to the handing of plastics at the end of their life.\n\nFor many years, we have been conducting research into soil-biodegradable and compostable plastics and their biodegradability in different environments. With ecoflex \u00ae and ecovio \u00ae , BASF has two certified bioplastics on the market that can biodegrade  under the conditions in the recognized standards according to which they are certified.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  we  are  developing  solutions  for  improved mechanical recycling. These include additives that extend the use phase of plastics and help address quality problems of recyclates. The use of BASF stabilizers also makes it possible to keep plastics in  circulation  not  just  for  one  cycle,  but  for  several.  Technical solutions from BASF, such as NIR spectroscopy or sustainable\n\ncleaning solutions, help to separate and then process different types of plastics.\n\nSince not all waste streams are suitable for mechanical recycling, BASF is also driving forward the chemical recycling of plastics as a complementary technology. In this process, plastics are broken down into their building blocks using various methods, which can then be used again in production as recycled feedstocks (see page 120).\n\nWe  are  involved  in  numerous  initiatives  to  advance  new  ideas together with partners. For example, BASF is a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), which is active in four focus areas: developing infrastructure for waste collection,  promoting innovative recycling methods, education and  engagement of various stakeholders, and cleanup of areas heavily impacted by plastic waste. The initiative aims to invest up to $1.5/uni00A0billion by 2023. Further examples of our commitment to greater sustainability in the plastics value chain include the World Plastics Council, Operation Clean Sweep and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nFor more information on plastics, see plasticsjourney.basf.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the AEPW, see endplasticwaste.org\n\nFor more information on the World Plastics Council, see worldplasticscouncil.org\n\nFor more information on Operation Clean Sweep, see opcleansweep.org\n\nFor more information on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, see ellenmacarthurfoundation.org",

Increasing energy and raw materials prices made many products more expensive and dampened consumers' purchasing power. European chemical production fell sharply due to drastic increases in regional gas prices.\n\nFor the outlook on the economic environment in 2023, see page/uni00A0151 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## At a glance\n\n+3.0% Global GDP growth\n\n+2.2% Increase in global chemical\n\nproduction\n\n- /uni25AA Energy price shock and drop in chemical production in Europe\n- /uni25AA High interest rates and weak economic data in the United States\n- /uni25AA Volatile economic development in Asia\n- /uni25AA Drastic increase in European gas prices and rising oil price\n\nGlobal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.0% compared with/uni00A0 the previous year (2021: +6.1%). Global industrial production added  2.5%  (2021:  +6.2%),  while  global  chemical  production expanded by only 2.2% (2021: +6.1%). The average price for a barrel of Brent crude oil increased to $101/uni00A0per barrel (2021: $71/uni00A0per barrel). Gas prices in Europe averaged \u20ac124.16/uni00A0per MWh ($38.01/uni00A0per mmBtu) for the year, more than double the prior-year level and more than ten times the 2020 level.\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2022\n\nGlobal economic development in the course of 2022 was exceptionally volatile and characterized by strong regional differences. Macroeconomic developments were driven by a number of key, overlapping factors: the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in the advanced economies, China's long commitment to a zero-COVID policy and the repercussions of the strong fiscal stimuli in previous years. The spike in energy prices, especially natural gas prices in Europe and prices on the inter  national  LNG  markets,  significantly  impacted  the  development  of indus trial activity. Overall demand was also dampened by the sharp rise in inflation rates and rising interest rates in almost all countries (with the exception of China and Japan). The upturn in inflation rates was mainly driven by higher energy prices, with bottlenecks on the labor and goods markets also playing a role. The strong U.S. dollar drove up inflation in all countries that imported goods and raw materials from the dollar area.\n\n## In this section:\n\nEconomic Environment Results of Operations Net Assets Financial Position Actual Development Compared With Outlook for 2022 Business Review by Segment Other Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business Regional Results E.U. Taxonomy\n\nDespite the crises and the weak growth momentum in the course of/uni00A0 2022, many countries still reported comparatively high annual growth rates in their statistics.\n\nThe global economy fluctuated over the course of 2022 and saw significant regional differences. Gross domestic product in the European Union initially increased significantly, while the United States started the year with a technical recession. This reversed in the second half of the year. The European economies grew only weakly, and  macroeconomic  activity  in  the  United  States  accelerated slightly. In the emerging markets of Asia, economic development was volatile throughout the year. This was mainly driven by gross domestic product in China: A solid start to the year was followed by a decline in the second quarter, and, after a renewed recovery in the third quarter, there were again strong braking effects toward the end of the year.\n\n- 1 All information relating to past years in this section can deviate from the previous year's report due to statistical revisions. Where available, calendar-adjusted macroeconomic growth rates are reported. Figures for 2022 not yet available in full are estimated.",

In the first half of the year, the catch-up effects of the corona virus pandemic had a positive impact on the services sector and on traditional vacation countries. GDP rose by 3.9% and 5.5% in Italy and Spain, respectively, and by 2.7% even in France. In Germany, by contrast, GDP increased by only 1.9%. German industrial production was down slightly overall. In the/uni00A0 energy-intensive industries,  production  actually  declined  sig nifi cantly  due  to  the drastic rise in energy prices. Due to high service imports from foreign tourism and weaker growth in demand for goods from abroad, net exports did not contribute to growth. Investment also remained weak. By contrast, private consumption grew by more than 4%. This was mainly due to catch-up effects in the services sector. However, consumer and business sentiment  became increasingly clouded by rising energy prices and economic uncertainty resulting from the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Eastern E.U. countries recorded comparatively strong growth of over 4% (2021: +6.1%). However, economic activity slowed considerably in the course of the year as a result of weaker export and consumer demand and double-digit inflation rates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom , sharp increases in the cost of living dampened private consumption. Industrial production declined in the course of the year and investment was impacted by the sharp rise in interest rates. Thanks to a dynamic recovery in the services sector, the economy nevertheless grew by 4.1% (2021: +7.6%).\n\nDevelopments in Russia were strongly influenced by the international  sanctions  imposed  as  a  result  of  the  Russian  attack  on Ukraine. GDP sank by an estimated 3.1% in 2022. Negative economic effects in the wake of the trade and financial sanctions imposed by the United States and the E.U. were partly offset by rising raw materials prices and the substitution of goods imports by domestic  production.\n\nIn the United States , GDP fell in the first two quarters of 2022 compared  with  the  second  half  of  2021.  Goods  consumption and/uni00A0 housing investment declined. Foreign trade also had a strong negative impact on growth in the first quarter. By contrast, services consumption made a consistently positive contribution. The U.S. economy picked up in the second half of the year, mainly due to a/uni00A0 stronger foreign trade surplus and solid private consumption. Overall, the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in 2022 (2021: +5.9%).\n\nEconomic developments in the emerging markets of Asia were mixed. In China , growth was repeatedly weighed down by restrictions under the government's zero-COVID strategy. A positive first quarter of 2022 was followed by a drop in GDP in the second quarter as a result of lockdowns in many Chinese cities. By contrast, the third quarter saw a dynamic recovery. In the fourth quarter, rising infection rates and the abrupt change of course in the zero-COVID policy again led to a weaker economic performance. Overall, GDP growth in China remained well below its medium-term growth path at 3.0%. The weak economy and ongoing travel restrictions in China also dampened growth in many other countries in the region, which have  close  trade  relations  with  China.  Nonetheless,  the  other emerging Asian economies achieved overall growth of 5.5%.\n\n- 1 We define the emerging markets of Asia as the ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam), India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nRecurring waves of coronavirus infections also impacted growth in Japan (+1.2%) and South Korea (+2.6%). Industrial production was also depressed by supply problems in the automotive and electronics industries and weaker foreign demand.\n\nIn South America , growth picked up in the first half of the year, supported by high raw materials prices and catch-up effects in private demand. Private consumption in Brazil was also boosted by/uni00A0 government transfers and tax cuts ahead of the presidential elections.  In Argentina , private consumption also continued to grow strongly despite high inflation and interest rates. However, eco nomic activity in the region weakened significantly in the second half of the year. Overall, South America's GDP grew by 3.7% (2021: +7.7%).\n\n## Trends in key customer industries\n\nDisruptions in global supply chains gradually eased in 2022. However, due to the zero-COVID policy in China and the lockdowns there in the second quarter of 2022, supply bottlenecks remained in global supply chains, for example, in the automotive and electronics industries. At the same time, demand for consumer durables in particular weakened over the course of the year. Industries such as furniture had seen frontloading effects here in recent years due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, declining purchasing power caused by inflation reduced demand from end consumers. In the construction sector, the continued dynamic upturn in construction costs and rising interest rates had a negative impact.\n\nGlobal industrial production expanded by only 2.5% overall in 2022 (2021: +6.2%). At 0.9%, growth in the advanced economies was  significantly  weaker  than  in  the  emerging  markets,  which recorded growth of 3.8%. Despite the generally subdued economic environment in Asia, more than 60% of the growth in global industrial value added was generated there. Over 40% of growth came from China in 2022. Industrial growth was 3.2% in Asia as a whole and 3.8% in the emerging Asian economies. In the E.U., by contrast,",

Overall, however, automotive production grew by around 4.8/uni00A0million in 2022 to 82/uni00A0million (+6.2%) manufactured passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. All markets grew except Eastern Europe (around 700,000 fewer vehicles produced). The strongest volume growth came from Asia. The world's largest vehicle market added 3.3/uni00A0million vehicles, an increase of 7.7%. Of this figure, China accounted for around 1.5/uni00A0million vehicles and India for over 900,000. In China, sales were boosted by a reduction in sales tax. Almost 700,000/uni00A0more vehicles (+5.7%) were produced in the E.U. and around 1.3/uni00A0million more (+9.7%) in North America than in the previous year. In South America, the increase was around 200,000/uni00A0 vehicles (+8.5%). Around 75% of the total market growth of 4.8/uni00A0 million vehicles was attri but able to purely battery- electric vehicles. Consequently, electric vehicles' share of all vehicles produced rose from around 6%/uni00A0in 2021 to around 10%.\n\nProduction in the construction industry was impacted by rising interest rates and construction costs. At 2.2%, overall growth was weaker than in the previous year (+2.4%). The infrastructure  segment\n\ngrew  significantly  faster  than  residential  construction  and  other building construction. In China, investment in residential  construction declined, while infrastructure investment again posted considerable growth. In the E.U., by contrast, residential construction activity was still comparatively strong, although demand began to cool in the course of the year due to rising interest rates. In the United States, all construction segments declined as a result of high interest rates and restricted public budgets.\n\nConsumer goods production grew by 3.1%, much slower than in/uni00A0 the previous year (+8.8%). Demand weakened for consumer durables in particular. Production in the furniture and textile industries declined after having grown by more than 8% and around 5%,/uni00A0respectively, in the previous year. Production of chemicals used to manufacture care products grew at about the same rate as global/uni00A0GDP.\n\nGrowth in the electronics industry also weakened significantly (2022: 5.9%, 2021: 12.4%). In electronic components, computers and peripherals, communications electronics and consumer electronics, growth declined sharply compared with 2021. Double-digit growth rates were recorded in all segments in the previous year.\n\nProduction in the energy and raw materials sector increased by around 3.7% in 2022, slightly more than GDP. Weaker growth in Russia was offset by stronger production in the Middle East and the United States. Oil and gas production again saw strong growth after stagnating in 2021, while the production of other raw materials grew at a slightly slower rate than in the previous year.\n\nGrowth in health and nutrition was considerably weaker, declining from 5.9% to 2.3% in 2022. At 1.9%, production in the food industry grew at a slightly slower rate than the longer-term average and was significantly weaker than in the previous year, which was characterized by catch-up effects. In the pharmaceutical industry, growth fell sharply after the 2021 vaccine boom (+12.9%) but was still positive at 1.9%.\n\nAgricultural production declined from 3.5% in the previous year to 2.3% in 2022. The slowdown was mainly due to the war in Ukraine and a long dry spell in some regions over the summer. As a result of the war, production in Ukraine fell by an estimated 35% and by 4.5% in Eastern Europe as a whole. Production also declined slightly in Western Europe and in the Americas. In Asia, by contrast, agricultural production grew by 3.7%.\n\n## Trends in the chemical industry\n\nGlobal growth in the chemical industry lagged behind the industry as a whole in 2022 and at 2.2%, was significantly weaker than in the previous year (+6.1%). In the E.U., production fell considerably by 5.8% due to the sharp rise in natural gas prices. In Germany, this even dropped by around 12% as a result of shutdowns in the production of gas-intensive basic chemicals. The United Kingdom also saw a strong decrease in chemical production.\n\nBy contrast, chemical production in the United States increased by 2.3%. However, base effects due to weather-related production losses in 2021 played a major role here (2021: +1.7%). In South America, production grew by 2.6%, slightly slower than in the previous year (+3.6%).\n\nChemical production in Asia expanded by 4.2% overall. However, this varied widely by country. In China, the world's largest chemical market, production grew by a very volatile 6.6% overall. Production also increased significantly in India (+4.6%). By contrast, in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, production fell by 3.0%, 7.4% and 12.9%, respectively.\n\nChemical production in the Middle East increased by 4.0%, slower than in 2021. Growth was stronger in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates but declined significantly in Iran and especially in Turkey.",

The increase in travel in the advanced economies boosted demand for oil, while demand in China declined slightly due to continued travel restrictions and temporary lockdowns. Crude oil prices rose from $71/uni00A0per barrel of Brent in 2021 to $101/uni00A0per barrel in 2022 due to growth in demand for oil, war and sanctions-related constraints and an OPEC+ production cut agreed in October. The price of oil fluctuated over the course of the year between around $122/uni00A0 per barrel in June and around $81/uni00A0 per barrel in December. Over the course of the year, the average monthly price for the chemi cal raw material naphtha ranged between $1,012/uni00A0per metric ton in March and $594/uni00A0per metric ton in December. At $770/uni00A0per metric ton, the annual average price of naphtha in 2022 was higher than in 2021 ($635/uni00A0per metric ton).\n\n$/barrel, $/metric ton\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to low gas storage levels in Europe at the end of the heating season in the second quarter of 2022 and the ongoing reduction in Russian gas supplies, gas prices on the Northwest Euro pean spot market rose sharply through August.

At 10.0%, ROCE was considerably below the prior-year figure.\n\nExceptionally high impairment losses on the shareholding in Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG negatively affected the BASF Group's net income from shareholdings.\n\n- Business reviews by segment can be found from page 69 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of CO2 emissions, see page 135 onward\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Sales considerably higher than previous year\n- /uni25AA EBIT before special items and ROCE down sharply\n- /uni25AA Net income from shareholdings down by -\u20ac4,939 million\n- /uni25AA Earnings per share of -\u20ac0.70; adjusted earnings per share of/uni00A0\u20ac6.96\n\nCompared with the previous year, sales rose by \u20ac8,729/uni00A0million to \u20ac87,327/uni00A0million in the 2022 business year. Sales growth was mainly driven  by  higher  prices  across  almost  all  segments  due  to  an increase in raw materials and energy prices. The Materials and Chemicals  segments  implemented  the  highest  price  increases. Currency  effects considerably supported the positive sales development. Portfolio effects in the Surface Technologies segment from the acquisition of a majority shareholding in BASF Shanshan Battery\n\nMaterials Co.,/uni00A0Ltd. as of  August/uni00A031, 2021, also contributed to the sales increase. This more than compensated for negative portfolio effects in the Industrial Solutions segment, mainly from the sale of the global pigments business as of June 30, 2021. Significantly lower volumes overall dampened sales growth in the BASF/uni00A0Group. Volumes development was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in the Surface  Technologies and Chemicals segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Sales Million \u20ac   |        |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| 2022              | 87,327 |\n| 2021              | 78,598 |\n| 2020 2019         | 59,149 |\n|                   | 59,316 |\n| 2018  a           | 60,220 |\n\n- a Sales for 2018 were reduced by the share attributable to construction chemicals activities due to their presentation as discontinued operations.\n\n## Factors influencing sales of the BASF Group\n\n|                                       | Change in   million \u20ac   |   Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Volumes                               | -5,498                  |          -7   |\n| Prices                                | 9,350                   |          11.9 |\n| Currencies                            | 4,765                   |           6.1 |\n| Acquisitions                          | 790                     |           1   |\n| Divestitures                          | -564                    |          -0.7 |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation | -114                    |          -0.1 |\n| Total change in sales                 | 8,729                   |          11.1 |\n\nAt \u20ac6,878 million, income from operations (EBIT) before special items was \u20ac890 million below the prior-year figure. The earnings development  was  attributable  to  a  strong  decline  in  earnings con tribu tions from the Chemicals and Materials segments. Both segments  recorded lower margins and volumes as well as higher fixed costs. By contrast, EBIT before special items rose in all other\n\nsegments.  The  Agricultural  Solutions  segment  increased  EBIT before special items considerably, in particular as a/uni00A0 result of the positive sales performance. The Nutrition & Care  segment also achieved a considerable increase here, mainly due to price-driven margin  growth.  The  Surface  Tech nologies  segment  recorded con sid er ably higher earnings, especially due to  increased earnings contributions from the automotive  catalysts and battery  materials businesses. Higher prices and volumes in the Coatings division additionally supported the segment's earnings performance. The Industrial Solutions segment slightly increased EBIT before special items as a result of price-driven margin growth. EBIT before special items attributable to Other improved slightly.\n\nFor an explanation of the indicator EBIT before special items, see page 42\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBIT before special items\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n| 2022       | 6,878   | 6,878   | 6,878   |\n|------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 2021       |         | 7,768   |         |\n| 2020       | 3,560   |         |         |\n| 2019  a    | 4,643   | 6,281   |         |\n| 2018  a, b |         |         |         |\n\n- a EBIT before special items for 2019 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral companies  accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings.

Special charges for restructuring measures were \u20ac249 million, mainly in connection with the carve-out of the newly established BASF Environmental Catalyst and Metal Solutions unit within the Catalysts division, the dis continuation  of  our  business  activities  in  Russia  and  restructuring measures. In other charges and income, the impairment loss on a plant in the  Chemicals segment in particular led to total special charges of \u20ac222 million (2021: other charges of \u20ac27 million).

        "page_content": "## Net income from shareholdings, financial result and income after taxes\n\nNet income from shareholdings amounted to -\u20ac4,939 million in 2022, after \u20ac207 million in 2021. The significant decline was due to special  charges  of  around  \u20ac6.3  billion,  mainly  from  non-casheffective impairment losses on the shareholding in Wintershall Dea AG. These were especially due to the deconsolidation of Wintershall Dea's Russian exploration and production activities, which subsequently  resulted  in  a  revaluation  of  Wintershall  Dea's  Russian shareholdings.   Furthermore, write-downs were performed on the company's European gas transportation business, including a complete impairment on the shareholding in Nord Stream AG and the financing of the Nord Stream 2 project. Wintershall Dea's operating earnings contribution for 2022 rose to approximately \u20ac1.5 billion, after \u20ac335 million in the previous year.\n\nThe financial result improved by \u20ac17 million to -\u20ac418 million. This was mainly attributable to the \u20ac136 million improvement in the other financial result. This predominantly resulted from higher net interest income on income taxes and lower net expense in connection with bonds in foreign currency and related hedging instruments. By  contrast,  the  interest  result  decreased  by  \u20ac119  million  to -\u20ac433/uni00A0 million, especially driven by higher interest expenses for financial  indebtedness due to increased interest rates and a higher financing  volume.\n\nOverall, income before income taxes amounted to \u20ac1,190/uni00A0million in  2022,  after  \u20ac7,448/uni00A0 million  in  the  previous  year.  Income  tax expenses were \u20ac1,581/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac1,430/uni00A0million). Given the high impairment losses in net income from shareholdings, which do not have an impact on tax expense, the tax rate was 132.9%.\n\nNoncontrolling interests amounted to \u20ac236/uni00A0million compared with \u20ac459/uni00A0million in 2021, primarily due to lower earnings contributions from BASF TotalEnergies Petrochemicals LLC, Houston, Texas, and\n\nBASF PETRONAS Chemicals Sdn./uni00A0Bhd., Kuala Lumpur,  Malaysia. This was partially offset by higher earnings contributions from the BASF Shanshan companies.\n\nNet income was -\u20ac627/uni00A0 million compared with \u20ac5,523 million in 2021.\n\nEarnings per share amounted to -\u20ac0.70 compared with \u20ac6.01 in the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the items in the statement of income, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 203\n\nFor more information on the tax rate, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page/uni00A0237 onward\n\n## Additional indicators for results of operations\n\nWe also use alternative performance measures (APMs) to steer the BASF/uni00A0 Group. Investors, analysts and rating agencies use them to assess our performance. These are not defined by IFRS. As such, the methods of calculation can differ from those used by other companies. Alternative performance measures for the results of operations are EBIT before special items, EBITDA before special items, EBITDA, the EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share. Other APMs are net debt, 1 free cash flow 1 and capital expenditures (capex). 2\n\nIncome from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) and income from opera tions before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are indicators that describe operational performance independent of age-related depre ciation and amortization of assets and any impairment or  reversal of impairment. Both figures are therefore  particularly useful in cross-company comparisons. EBITDA before special items is also highly useful in making comparisons over time. The EBITDA margin is a relative indicator and is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA\n\n- 1 For more information on these indicators, see the Financial Position from page 63 onward.\n- 2 For more information on capex, see Our Steering Concept on page 42 and Material Investments and Portfolio Measures on page 37.\n\nto sales revenue, enabling operational performance to be compared independently of the size of the underlying business.\n\nEBITDA before special items in 2022 was \u20ac585/uni00A0million below the 2021 figure at \u20ac10,762/uni00A0million; EBITDA decreased by \u20ac607 million to \u20ac10,748 million.

Amortization, impairments and reversals of impairments on intangible assets are then eliminated. Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on noncontrolling interests are also considered. This makes adjusted earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting future profitability.\n\nIn 2022, adjusted earnings per share amounted to \u20ac6.96 compared with \u20ac6.76 in the previous year.\n\n- For more information on the earnings per share according to IFRS, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 226",

This was largely attributable to the \u20ac5,198/uni00A0 million decrease in the carrying amounts of nonintegral  shareholdings  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method, mainly  due  to  impairments  on  the  shareholding  in  Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG totaling \u20ac6,531/uni00A0million. These primarily related to Wintershall Dea's Russian activities and its European gas transportation business.\n\nDeferred tax assets declined by \u20ac1,720/uni00A0million, mainly due to lower pension provisions.\n\nIntangible assets amounted to \u20ac13,273/uni00A0million, \u20ac227/uni00A0million below the prior year-end figure. This largely reflected amortization of \u20ac648/uni00A0million, which was partially offset by additions of \u20ac125/uni00A0million. Currency effects increased intangible assets by \u20ac330/uni00A0million. Goodwill rose by \u20ac176/uni00A0 million to \u20ac7,696 million, mainly from currency effects.",

The addition of the interest in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm following the sale of shares was offset by decreases at Lucura Versicherungs/uni00A0 AG due to the transition to full consolidation and at BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China.\n\nThe  \u20ac1,414/uni00A0 million  increase  in  property,  plant  and  equipment was/uni00A0 mainly due to additions of \u20ac4,842/uni00A0 million, which exceeded depre ciation by \u20ac1,273/uni00A0million. Currency effects of \u20ac286/uni00A0million also contributed to the increase.\n\nOther financial assets were \u20ac545/uni00A0million higher than the prior yearend figure, in particular from the first-time inclusion of Lucura Versicherungs/uni00A0AG in the consolidated financial statements as a fully consolidated company.\n\nNoncurrent other receivables and miscellaneous assets amounted to \u20ac1,810/uni00A0million, up \u20ac88/uni00A0million from the previous year, largely as a result of higher defined benefit assets.\n\nCurrent assets rose by \u20ac2,371/uni00A0 million compared with December/uni00A0 31, 2021, primarily from the \u20ac2,159/uni00A0 million increase in inventories; the Agricultural Solutions segment in particular recorded inventory  growth.\n\nOther  current  receivables  and  miscellaneous  assets  rose  by \u20ac1,023/uni00A0 million, mainly due to higher precious metal trading items, higher positive fair values of derivatives and higher tax refund claims.\n\nTrade accounts receivable increased by \u20ac114/uni00A0million year on year.\n\nThe assets reported as disposal groups as of December/uni00A031, 2021, were  divested  in  2022:  BASF  sold  51%  of  its  interest  in  the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm in the second quarter and the divestiture  of  the  kaolin  minerals  business  was  completed  on September/uni00A030.\n\nAt \u20ac2,516/uni00A0 million, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac108/uni00A0 million below the figure as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual asset items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page/uni00A0209 onward",

Retained earnings were \u20ac4,912/uni00A0 million below the/uni00A0 figure as of December/uni00A031, 2021. This was due to the negative net  income, share buybacks in the amount of \u20ac1.3/uni00A0billion and dividend payments for 2021 of \u20ac3.1/uni00A0billion. By contrast, other comprehensive income rose by \u20ac3,683/uni00A0million, mainly from actuarial gains and  currency effects.\n\nAt 48.4%, the equity ratio was at the prior-year level (48.2%).\n\nNoncurrent liabilities declined by \u20ac2,110/uni00A0million compared with the 2021 year-end. This was primarily attributable to the \u20ac3,351/uni00A0million decrease in provisions for pensions and similar obligations, mainly as a result of higher interest rates in all relevant currency zones.\n\nThe \u20ac133/uni00A0million decrease in other provisions largely resulted from lower provisions for interest on tax risks and for personnel expenses.\n\nIn addition, tax provisions decreased by \u20ac85/uni00A0million.\n\nThe \u20ac1,407/uni00A0 million increase in noncurrent financial indebtedness primarily reflected the issue of new euro-denominated bonds with a/uni00A0 total volume of \u20ac3,484/uni00A0 million. This was partially offset by the reclassification of three bonds with an aggregate carrying amount of \u20ac2,035/uni00A0million from noncurrent to current financial indebtedness.",

In/uni00A0 addition, current financial indebtedness was \u20ac424/uni00A0million above the figure as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. This was attributable to the above- mentioned reclassification of three bonds in the aggregate amount of around \u20ac2.1/uni00A0billion from noncurrent to current financial indebtedness, including interest and currency effects, as well as to the \u20ac406/uni00A0million increase in commercial paper at BASF/uni00A0SE. This was partially offset by the scheduled repayment of three bonds  totaling around \u20ac2/uni00A0billion.\n\nOther liabilities declined by \u20ac312/uni00A0million year on year, mainly due to lower liabilities from precious metal trading and lower negative fair values of derivatives.\n\nTax liabilities decreased by \u20ac166/uni00A0million.\n\nFurthermore, current provisions were \u20ac136/uni00A0million below the prioryear figure, largely as a result of lower provisions for bonus payments as well as for restructuring; higher provisions for rebates had an offsetting effect.\n\nNet debt rose by \u20ac1,916/uni00A0million compared with December/uni00A031, 2021, to \u20ac16,268/uni00A0million.\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual equity and liability items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 209 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of the balance sheet, see the Ten-Year Summary on page/uni00A0293\n\n## Net debt\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                   | December/uni00A031,  2022   | December/uni00A031,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Noncurrent financial indebtedness | 15,171                      | 13,764                      |\n| + Current financial indebtedness  | 3,844                       | 3,420                       |\n| Financial indebtedness            | 19,016                      | 17,184                      |\n| - Marketable securities           | 232                         | 208                         |\n| - Cash and cash equivalents       | 2,516                       | 2,624                       |\n| Net debt                          | 16,268                      | 14,352                      |\n\n## Off-balance sheet obligations\n\nOff-balance sheet obligations mainly relate to long-term purchase obligations  for  raw  materials  and  long-term  supply  agreements for electricity from renewable sources. In addition, obligations exist in connection with initiated or planned investment projects (2022: \u20ac13,982/uni00A0million). In 2022, new obligations of this type arose pri marily in connection with the construction of the new BASF Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China.\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A025 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page/uni00A0268 and the forecast from page/uni00A0154 onward\n\n## Financing policy and credit ratings\n\nOur financing policy aims to ensure our solvency at all times, limiting the risks associated with financing and optimizing our cost of  capital. We preferably meet our external financing needs on the  international capital markets.\n\nWe strive to maintain a solid A rating, which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets. Our financing measures are aligned with our operational business planning as well as the company's strategic direction and also ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic options.\n\n## Maturities of financial indebtedness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Million \u20ac       |       |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| 2023            | 3,844 |\n| 2024            | 1,300 |\n| 2025            | 1,918 |\n| 2026            | 2,177 |\n| 2027            | 2,381 |\n| 2028 and beyond |       |\n\nBASF enjoys good credit ratings, especially compared with competi tors in the chemical industry. Moody's most recently confirmed its rating of A3/P-2/outlook stable on January/uni00A018, 2023. Standard/uni00A0& Poor's confirmed its rating of A/A-1/outlook negative on December/uni00A0 8, 2022. Fitch maintained its rating of A/F1/outlook stable on November/uni00A030, 2022.\n\nWe have solid financing, both for ongoing business and for investment projects initiated or planned. Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our \u20ac20/uni00A0billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, diversify our financing and optimize our debt capital financing conditions.",

        "page_content": "For short-term financing, we use BASF/uni00A0 SE's global commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5/uni00A0billion. As of December/uni00A031, 2022, commercial paper with a carrying amount of \u20ac654/uni00A0million was outstanding under this program. A firmly committed, syndicated credit line of \u20ac6/uni00A0 billion with a term until 2026 covers the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. It can also be used for general company purposes. This credit line and another short-term credit line of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion that was taken out in April 2022 were not used at any point in 2022. Our external financing is therefore largely independent of short-term fluctuations in the credit markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF Group's most important financial contracts contain no side agreements with regard to specific financial ratios (financial covenants) or compliance with a specific rating (rating trigger).\n\nTo minimize risks and leverage internal optimization potential within the  Group,  we  bundle  the  financing,  financial  investments  and foreign  currency  hedging  of  BASF/uni00A0 SE's  subsidiaries  within  the BASF/uni00A0 Group where possible. Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged centrally using derivative financial instruments in the market.\n\nOur interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing interest expenses for the BASF/uni00A0 Group and limiting interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital market from fixed to variable interest rates or vice versa.\n\n- For more information on the financing tools and hedging instruments used, see Note/uni00A021 from page/uni00A0257 onward and Note/uni00A026 from page/uni00A0269 onward in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to \u20ac7,709/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac7,245/uni00A0million in the previous year. The improvement was primarily due to lower cash tied up in net working capital as well as to higher depreciation and amortization. Net income declined by/uni00A0 \u20ac6,150/uni00A0 million year on year to -\u20ac627/uni00A0million. The loss is mainly attribut able to the negative equity-accounted earnings contribution from Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG (-\u20ac4,853/uni00A0million), which is eliminated as a noncash effect in miscellaneous items. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was \u20ac514/uni00A0million above the prior-year figure.\n\nThe \u20ac935/uni00A0million decrease in cash tied up in net working capital in 2022 is partly due to the reduction in trade accounts receivable, which had increased significantly in the previous year. In addition, less cash was tied up in inventories in the year under review than in 2021. Dividend payments from shareholdings accounted for using the equity method and other shareholdings recognized under other receivables rose by \u20ac946/uni00A0million. By contrast, the reduction in other provisions led to an outflow of cash. In particular, bonus payments to employees in 2022 were significantly higher than in the previous year. Moreover, the increase in trade accounts payable in the year under  review was not as strong as in the previous year.\n\nCash flows from investing activities totaled -\u20ac3,778/uni00A0 million in 2022, after -\u20ac2,622/uni00A0million in the previous year. Payments made for property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  rose  by \u20ac843/uni00A0million to \u20ac4,375/uni00A0million, mainly due to investments in the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. Payments received from divestitures in the amount of \u20ac691/uni00A0million resulted primarily from the sale of/uni00A0 shares  in  the  Hollandse  Kust  Zuid  wind  farm  and  the  sale of/uni00A0the/uni00A0 kaolin minerals business. These were partially offset by cash outflows of \u20ac13/uni00A0million for a subsequent purchase price adjustment from the acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business. In 2021, payments received for  divestitures amounted to \u20ac1,030/uni00A0 million and mainly related to the sale of the global pigments business. An off setting effect in 2021 was the \u20ac600/uni00A0 million payment made for the acquisi tion of 51% of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. In addition, the sale of our shares in Solenis led to cash inflows in the previous year.\n\nCash flows from financing activities amounted to -\u20ac4,013/uni00A0mil lion. In  addition  to  the  payment  of  dividends  in  the  amount  of \u20ac3,248/uni00A0 million  (2021:  \u20ac3,312/uni00A0 million),  BASF  bought  back  own shares worth \u20ac1,325/uni00A0million. This was partially offset by net additions to  financial and similar liabilities of \u20ac565/uni00A0million (2021: net disposal of/uni00A0\u20ac3,145/uni00A0million).\n\nFree cash flow , which remains after deducting payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash flows from operating activities, represents the financial resources remaining after investments. It amounted to \u20ac3,333/uni00A0million in 2022 after \u20ac3,713/uni00A0million in the previous year.",

        "page_content": "## Actual Development Compared With Outlook for 2022\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the BASF Group\n\nThe BASF Group increased sales to \u20ac87.3/uni00A0 billion in 2022, significantly exceeding the range forecast at the beginning of the year of \u20ac74/uni00A0 billion to \u20ac77/uni00A0 billion. However, sales were within the forecast range of \u20ac86/uni00A0billion to \u20ac89/uni00A0billion communicated in July 2022. The Materials,  Chemicals  and  Industrial  Solutions  segments  outperformed initial forecasts with considerable sales growth. We had originally anticipated only a slight increase in the Materials segment. We had expected a considerable decline in the Chemicals segment and a slight decrease in the Industrial Solutions segment. Sales in Other also improved considerably instead of slightly as forecast. Growth in BASF/uni00A0Group sales was mainly driven by significant price increases in the segments as a result of raw materials and energy price developments. Portfolio effects had a positive impact, as expected. We were only able to increase sales volumes as forecast in the Agricultural Solutions segment. Contrary to our expectations, we recorded lower volumes in all other segments as a result of weaker demand.\n\nAt \u20ac6.9 billion, EBIT before special items was within both the forecast range of \u20ac6.6/uni00A0billion to \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion from February 2022 and the adjusted range of \u20ac6.8/uni00A0billion to \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion from July 2022. The Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments considerably increased EBIT before special items, as expected. The Chemicals and Materials segments recorded a considerable decline in earnings as forecast. The Surface Technologies and Industrial Solutions segments did not develop as expected: The Surface Technologies segment significantly increased EBIT before special items, while the Industrial Solutions segment recorded slight earnings growth; we had assumed a slight deterioration in earnings in each case. EBIT before special items in Other improved slightly, also performing better than expected. We had forecast a considerable decrease.\n\n## Forecast/actual comparison\n\n|                        | Sales                                     | Sales                | EBIT before special items                    | EBIT before special items   | ROCE          | ROCE        |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                        | 2022 forecast                             | 2022 actual          | 2022 forecast                                | 2022 actual                 | 2022 forecast | 2022 actual |\n| Chemicals              |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Materials              |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Industrial Solutions   |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Surface Technologies   |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Nutrition & Care       |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Agricultural Solutions |                                           |                      |                                              |                             |               |             |\n| Other                  |                                           |                      |                                              |                             | -             | -           |\n| BASF/uni00A0Group      | \u20ac74/uni00A0billion-  \u20ac77/uni00A0billion a | \u20ac87.3/uni00A0billion | \u20ac6.6/uni00A0billion-   \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion a | \u20ac6.9/uni00A0billion         | 11.4%-12.6% a | 10.0%       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- At prior-year level: no change (+/-0.0%)\n\n|\n\n- Slight increase/decrease: 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-5.0% for sales; 0.1%-10.0% for earnings; 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- | Considerable increase/decrease: 'considerable' represents a change of 5.1% or higher for sales; 10.1% or higher for earnings; more than 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- a We updated our outlook in July 2022, forecasting sales of between \u20ac86/uni00A0billion and \u20ac89/uni00A0billion, EBIT before special items of between \u20ac6.8/uni00A0billion and \u20ac7.2/uni00A0billion, and a ROCE of between 10.5% and 11.0%.\n\nAt 10.0%, ROCE was above the cost of capital of 9%. Our expectations for ROCE materialized in all segments except Nutrition/uni00A0 & Care, where ROCE was slightly lower instead of considerably higher as forecast. Overall, ROCE for the BASF/uni00A0Group amounted to 10.0%, below the range we had forecast in February of between 11.4% and 12.6% and below the revised range from July 2022 of 10.5% to 11.0%. This reflected a significant increase in the cost of capital base amid lower earnings.\n\n## CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nCO2 emissions amounted to 18.4/uni00A0 million metric tons, well below the range forecast in February 2022 of 19.6/uni00A0million metric tons to 20.6/uni00A0million metric tons and at the lower end of the adjusted range from July 2022 of 18.4/uni00A0million metric tons to 19.4/uni00A0million metric tons. The main drivers here were the significant reduction in production volumes and the temporary shutdown of emission-intensive plants. One example is the ammonia plants, where production was curbed or temporarily shut down due to high natural gas prices. We continued to use electricity from renewable sources and purchase green electricity certificates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Capex forecast for the BASF/uni00A0Group\n\nIn 2022, we invested a total of \u20ac4.1/uni00A0billion in capital expenditures (capex),  excluding  additions  from  acquisitions,  IT  investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. The figure forecast in February 2022 was around \u20ac4.6/uni00A0billion.\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the segments\n\nWe considerably increased sales in the Chemicals segment in 2022 after forecasting a considerable decrease at the beginning of the year. Contrary to expectations, both divisions were able to significantly raise prices following sharp increases in raw materials and energy prices. At the beginning of 2022, we initially expected prices to decrease. Volumes were lower than expected due to weaker demand, especially in the second half of the year. The segment's EBIT before special items and ROCE declined considerably, as forecast.\n\nContrary to our assumption of slight sales growth, the Materials segment increased sales considerably. Here, too, this was mainly due to significant price increases after we had assumed lower prices in February. Weaker demand reduced sales volumes in both divisions. We had initially expected volume growth. EBIT before special items and ROCE declined considerably as forecast.\n\nSales in the Industrial Solutions segment rose considerably in 2022, despite our expectations of a slight decline. This was mainly due to significantly higher prices than originally assumed. These more than offset both the negative portfolio effects from the divestiture of the global pigments business and lower sales volumes. In February, we had assumed that volumes could be increased. The segment's EBIT before special items rose slightly, contrary to our forecast of a slight decrease. The expected margin-driven earnings growth in the Performance Chemicals division more than offset the decline in the Dispersions/uni00A0& Resins division, which was mainly due to the divestiture of the global pigments business. ROCE was  slightly above the prior-year level, as forecast.\n\nIn line with our forecast, sales in the Surface Technologies segment were considerably below the prior-year figure. EBIT before special items rose considerably; we had expected a slight decrease. The increase was due to considerable earnings growth in the Catalysts division as a result of higher earnings contributions from the automotive catalysts and battery materials businesses. This mainly reflected stronger growth in the automotive industry in 2022. ROCE was considerably lower, as forecast.\n\nIn the Nutrition/uni00A0 & Care segment, sales and EBIT before special items rose considerably as expected. ROCE declined slightly, contrary to our forecast of a considerable increase. This was mainly attributable to higher net working capital due to the increase in energy and raw materials prices.\n\nThe Agricultural Solutions segment recorded strong growth in sales, EBIT before special items and ROCE, as expected.\n\nSales in Other improved considerably due to much stronger- thanforecast  sales  growth  in  commodity  trading.  We  had  originally assumed a slight sales increase. EBIT before special items was slightly above the prior-year level; we had expected a considerable decline. This was primarily attributable to higher income from the long-term incentive program, among other factors. Income also arose from hedging transactions.\n\nFor more information on our forecast for 2023, see page 154 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on investments, see page 37 onward",

This reduced income from integral companies accounted for using the equity method, EBITDA before special items, EBITDA, EBIT and EBIT before special items in Other by \u20ac28/uni00A0million in the first quarter of 2021 and increased these indicators in the Petrochemicals division accordingly (rounding differences are possible). The effect was \u20ac28/uni00A0million in both the second and third quarters of 2021 and \u20ac34/uni00A0million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The effect in full-year 2021 was \u20ac118/uni00A0million. The operating assets were also reallocated as part of the reorganization and increased the Chemicals segment's assets by \u20ac114 million as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Segments:\n\nChemicals Materials Industrial Solutions Surface Technologies Nutrition & Care Agricultural Solutions\n\n## Contributions to EBITDA by segment in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Chemicals               | 26%   |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Materials               | 24%   |\n| Industrial Solutions    | 13%   |\n| Surface Technologies    | 12%   |\n| Nutrition/uni00A0& Care | 10%   |\n| Agricultural Solutions  | 18%   |\n| Other                   |       |\n\n## Contributions to assets by segment in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Chemicals               | 12%   |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Materials               | 13%   |\n| Industrial Solutions    |       |\n| Surface Technologies    | 18%   |\n| Nutrition/uni00A0& Care | 10%   |\n| Agricultural Solutions  |       |\n| Other                   |       |",

The  Petrochemicals  division  recorded  sales  of  \u20ac10,546/uni00A0 million, \u20ac871/uni00A0 million higher than in the previous year.

This was mainly attributable to sharp increases in prices for raw materials and energy. Price increases in the first half/uni00A0 of 2022 were also driven by strong demand and supply chain disrup tions, particularly in China as a result of the strict zero-COVID policy.  In  this  market  environment,  the  Petrochemicals  division raised prices in all business areas, especially for steam cracker products, styrene monomers and in the propylene value chain. Intermediates mainly raised prices in the amines business. By contrast, following price increases in early 2022, the butanediol and derivatives business  recorded a significant decline in prices in the second half of the year, particularly in Asia. This primarily reflected a significant slowdown in demand.\n\n## Segment data - Chemicals\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                              | 2022   | 2021   | +/-    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales to third parties                                                       | 14,895 | 13,579 | 9.7%   |\n| of which Petrochemicals                                                      | 10,546 | 9,674  | 9.0%   |\n| Intermediates                                                                | 4,349  | 3,904  | 11.4%  |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                       | 4,860  | 4,269  | 13.8%  |\n| Sales including transfers                                                    | 19,754 | 17,848 | 10.7%  |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items a | 2,774  | 3,842  | -27.8% |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) a       | 2,771  | 3,882  | -28.6% |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                | 18.6   | 28.6   | -      |\n| Depreciation and amortization b                                              | 1,013  | 767    | 32.1%  |\n| Income from operations (EBIT) a                                              | 1,758  | 3,115  | -43.6% |\n| Special items                                                                | -198   | 23     | .      |\n| EBIT before special items a                                                  | 1,956  | 3,092  | -36.7% |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE) a                                          | 15.6   | 33.9   | -      |\n| Assets a                                                                     | 10,481 | 10,482 | 0.0%   |\n| Investments including acquisitions c                                         | 1,701  | 1,157  | 47.0%  |\n| Research and development expenses                                            | 93     | 97     | -4.1%  |\n\n- a BASF's ethylene value chain was reorganized internally as of January 1, 2022.

This included special charges of \u20ac66/uni00A0million, largely from changes to the  production network for thermoplastic polyurethanes and the discontinuation of our business activities in Russia.\n\nFor the outlook for 2023, see page 154 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Division sales by region\n\n(Location of customer)\n\n| Divisions             | Europe   | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,  Africa, Middle East   | Total   (million/uni00A0\u20ac)   |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Performance Materials | 37%      | 23%             | 35%            | 5%                                    | 8,567                        |\n| Monomers              | 49%      | 21%             | 25%            | 5%                                    | 9,877                        |\n\n## Divisions, products, applications\n\n| Products                                                                                                                                                                                       | Customer industries and applications                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Engineering plastics, biodegradable plastics, foam specialties,  polyurethanes                                                                                                                 | Performance Materials Automotive, electrical engineering, packaging, footwear, sports and leisure,  furniture, household, mechanical engineering, construction, thermal insulation, |\n| Isocyanates (MDI, TDI), ammonia, caprolactam, adipic acid,  chlorine, urea, glues and impregnating resins, caustic soda,  polyamides 6 and 6.6, standard alcoholates, sulfuric and nitric acid | Monomers Industries such as plastics, woodworking, furniture, packaging, textile,  construction and automotive                                                                      |\n\n## Production capacities of selected products in the regions a\n\n| Product              | Europe        | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,  Africa, Middle East   | Annual capacity   (metric tons)   |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Ammonia              | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   |                |                                       | 1,765,000                         |\n| Chlorine             | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 |                |                                       | 595,000                           |\n| Urea                 | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 |                |                                       | 545,000                           |\n| Isocyanates          | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   | /uni25A0.alt1  |                                       | 2,700,000                         |\n| Polyamides 6 and 6.6 | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   | /uni25A0.alt1  |                                       | 925,000                           |\n| Polyamide precursors | /uni25A0.alt1 | /uni25A0.alt1   | /uni25A0.alt1  |                                       | 1,420,000                         |\n| Propylene oxide      | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 |                |                                       | 675,000                           |\n| Sulfuric acid        | /uni25A0.alt1 |                 |                |                                       | 920,000                           |\n\n- a All capacities are included at 100%, including plants belonging to joint operations and joint ventures.",

StarBloc \u00ae enables paint to be applied with a reduced film thickness of just 20/uni00A0/uni03BCm instead of 30/uni00A0/uni03BCm. It also offers advantages in the application process, such as a reduced number of application robots, which also saves solvents and cleaning efforts. This means that automotive manufacturers can save a third of the materials required compared with a standard series primer. For OEMs, lower material consumption also leads to/uni00A0 a reduction in their CO2 emissions and lower logistics costs.

This was driven by considerable earnings growth in both operating divisions. The increase in EBIT before special items in the Catalysts division was largely attributable to higher earnings contributions from the automotive catalysts and battery materials businesses. In the Coatings division, EBIT before special items increased mainly as a result of higher prices in all regions and higher volumes, especially in the automotive OEM coatings business. This more than offset increases in raw materials prices and fixed costs, primarily due to inflation and higher energy costs.\n\nAt \u20ac612/uni00A0million, EBIT was \u20ac148/uni00A0million below the prior-year figure. EBIT in 2022 included special charges, mainly for impairments in connection with the agreed divestiture of the production site in De/uni00A0Meern, Nether lands.

The preference shares previously held by BASF were converted into ordinary shares on May/uni00A01, 2022.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe price of a barrel of reference Brent crude oil averaged $101 in 2022 (2021: $71 per barrel). Gas prices on the European spot markets averaged \u20ac124.16/uni00A0per MWh ($38.01/uni00A0per mmBtu) for the year, more than double the prior-year level and more than ten times the 2020 level. The sharp increase in gas prices was driven by the extremely tight European gas market in 2022 due to the significant reduction in gas supplied by Russia to the E.U.\n\n## Equity-accounted income of the oil and gas business\n\nWintershall Dea/uni00A0AG contributed -\u20ac4,853/uni00A0million to net income from shareholdings in 2022 (2021: -\u20ac344/uni00A0million). This included special items totaling -\u20ac6,307/uni00A0million, primarily resulting from impairments on Wintershall Dea's Russian assets, the financing of Nord/uni00A0Stream/uni00A02, Wintershall Dea's participating interest in Nord Stream/uni00A0AG, and on assets in the German gas transportation business. In the previous year, lower oil and gas price forecasts and a divestiture of assets in Argentina led to impairments of \u20ac581/uni00A0million.\n\nBASF received dividend payments of approximately  \u20ac1/uni00A0billion from Wintershall Dea in 2022. In the previous year,  dividend payments from Wintershall Dea amounted to \u20ac488/uni00A0million.\n\nWintershall Dea conducts production, development 1 and exploration activities in the following countries:\n\n- - Egypt (production, development, exploration)\n- - Algeria (production)\n- - Argentina (production, development)\n- - Denmark (production, exploration)\n- - Germany (production, development, exploration)\n- - Libya (production)\n- - Mexico (production, development, exploration)\n- - Netherlands (production, development, exploration)\n- - Norway (production, development, exploration)\n- - Russia (activities deconsolidated in Q4/uni00A02022)\n- - United Arab Emirates (development)\n- - United Kingdom (production, development, exploration)\n\nWintershall Dea is also active in gas transportation. This includes interests in GASCADE Gastransport GmbH and OPAL Gastransport GmbH/uni00A0 &/uni00A0 Co./uni00A0 KG held by WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH/uni00A0 & Co./uni00A0 KG, and the interest in Nord Stream/uni00A0 AG held directly by Winters hall  Dea/uni00A0AG.\n\n## Current developments in the Russian business\n\nDue to increasing restrictions on its ability to influence its investments in Russia, largely as a result of government interference, Wintershall Dea deconsolidated its Russian segment in the fourth quarter of 2022 and subsequently recognized it as a financial asset measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 9. This figure is materially impaired by interference by the Russian government, especially in the second half of 2022. This significantly burdened earnings at Wintershall Dea and the BASF Group. Together with further impairments on assets relating to the Russian business Wintershall Dea's participating interests in Nord Stream/uni00A0 AG and\n\nWIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH/uni00A0 & Co. KG, as well as the loan/uni00A0 to Nord Stream/uni00A0 2/uni00A0 AG - the special charge in income from non- integral  share holdings accounted for using the equity method amounted to \u20ac6,517/uni00A0million. On January/uni00A017, 2023, Wintershall Dea announced its full exit from Russia in compliance with all legal requirements.\n\n## Wintershall Dea's activities in 2022\n\nWintershall Dea produced 218/uni00A0million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2022 (2021: 231/uni00A0million BOE), of which around 157/uni00A0million BOE of/uni00A0gas (2021: 165/uni00A0million BOE of gas). This corresponded to a daily production of 597/uni00A0thousand BOE (2021: 634/uni00A0thousand BOE).\n\nSeveral  development  projects  were  successfully  completed  in 2022,/uni00A0 including the Norwegian projects Nova, Dvalin and Njord. Production at Nova and Njord started in July and December 2022, respectively; Dvalin is scheduled to come on stream in early 2023.\n\nField development permits for the Dvalin North and Maria Phase/uni00A02 projects in Norway were applied for at the end of 2022. To further develop CMA-1 in Argentina, the CMA-1 consortium reached a final investment decision for the F\u00e9nix gas project in October 2022.\n\nWintershall Dea drilled 14/uni00A0exploration wells in 2022, half of which were successful. The result of one well is still pending.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Wintershall Dea reached an agreement on/uni00A0 the sale of its 50% interest in the unconventional oil blocks it/uni00A0 operated in Argentina and decided to terminate its operations in/uni00A0Brazil.",

In addition, the company is investing in various projects that aim to contribute to global decarbonization.\n\nWintershall Dea and several partners have initiated the BlueHyNow project on the German North Sea coast in Wilhelmshaven, which aims to produce hydrogen from natural gas. CO2 separated during the production of hydrogen will be shipped by sea to offshore locations in Norway and Denmark and stored under the seabed in underground reservoirs.\n\nTogether with Equinor, Stavanger, Norway, Wintershall Dea plans to pursue the development of an extensive and safe Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) value chain connecting continental European CO2 emitters to offshore storage sites on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (Nor-Ge project).\n\nWintershall Dea and its partner CapeOmega, Bergen, Norway, have been awarded a CO2 storage licence in the Norwegian North Sea by/uni00A0the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Wintershall Dea will be the operator of this licence, which is estimated to hold a CO2 storage injection capacity of up to 5/uni00A0million tons per year.\n\nAn initial public offering (IPO) of Wintershall Dea/uni00A0 AG would be virtu ally impossible in the current environment since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine. BASF stands by its strategic goal of divesting its share in Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG and accordingly, continues to target an IPO of Wintershall Dea.",

This was primarily the result of strong sales growth in the Materials and Chemicals segments. The Nutrition/uni00A0 & Care and Agricultural Solutions segments and  Other  also  recorded  considerably  higher  sales.  Sales  rose slightly in the Industrial Solutions segment but declined considerably in the Surface Technologies segment.\n\nThe sales increase was mainly attributable to higher prices in all segments. Sales growth was supported by currency effects. Lower sales volumes in all segments except Agricultural Solutions had an offsetting effect. Sales performance was also impacted by negative portfolio effects, particularly in the Industrial Solutions segment following the divestiture of the global pigments business in the previous  year.\n\n## North America\n\nSales at companies based in North America rose by 11.0% to \u20ac24,343/uni00A0million compared with 2021. In local currency terms, they were 1.0% below the prior-year figure. The positive sales development was mainly attributable to considerable sales growth in the Materials  and  Agricultural  Solutions  segments.  Sales  were  also considerably higher in the Industrial Solutions segment, in Other and in the Chemicals and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments. Only the Surface Technologies segment posted a strong decrease.\n\nIn addition to positive currency effects, substantial price increases in almost all segments contributed to sales growth. This more than compensated for significantly lower precious metal prices in the/uni00A0 Surface Technologies segment. Sales were reduced by lower volumes, mainly driven by the decline in precious metal trading in the/uni00A0Surface Technologies segment. Slightly negative portfolio effects also impacted sales performance in the region. This mainly resulted from the divestiture of the global pigments business in the Industrial Solutions segment.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nSales at companies headquartered in the Asia Pacific region were 3.3% above the prior-year figure, at \u20ac21,309/uni00A0million. In local  currency terms, sales declined by 2.8%. This was mainly due to considerable sales growth in the Materials, Nutrition & Care, Industrial Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments. The Surface Technologies segment achieved slightly higher sales. The Chemicals segment recorded a considerable decline in sales. In Greater China, sales decreased by 1.4% to \u20ac11,850/uni00A0million.\n\nSales growth in the region was driven by positive  currency effects and portfolio effects following the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery  Materials  in  the  Surface  Technologies   segment.  Higher prices,  mainly  in  the  Industrial  Solutions,  Nutrition/uni00A0 &  Care  and Materials segments, also contributed to the sales increase. Recurring production and supply chain disruptions resulting from the long- running, strict zero-COVID policy in China hampered sales development in the region and led to a considerable  decline in volumes, especially in the Surface Technologies and Chemicals segments.\n\n## South America, Africa, Middle East\n\nSales at companies located in South America, Africa and the Middle East rose by 17.0% in local currency terms and by 31.9% in euros to/uni00A0 \u20ac5,854/uni00A0 million.  All  segments  recorded  strong  sales  growth, especially Agricultural Solutions.\n\nThe positive sales development was primarily due to significantly higher prices and clearly positive currency effects in all segments. Sales growth was supported by slightly higher volumes overall, mainly driven by the Industrial Solutions, Nutrition/uni00A0 & Care and Surface Technologies segments.",

        "page_content": "## E.U. Taxonomy\n\nIn accordance with the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementary delegated acts, the Nonfinancial Statement includes the proportion of the Group's taxonomy-eligible and, for the first time, taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for 2022. This applies to the environ mental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation currently addressed in the E.U. tax onomy. BASF activities that are not yet covered by the E.U. tax onomy, and as such, are not relevant under the taxonomy, are  generally reported as taxonomy-non-eligible in accordance with the delegated acts. These include large parts of BASF's activities that may nevertheless be in line with the E.U.'s  environmental objectives.\n\nIn order to derive the financial indicators, an analysis of our product portfolio  identified  the  following  economic  activities  within  the meaning of the E.U. taxonomy under the environmental objective of climate change mitigation as relevant for BASF:\n\n- - Manufacture of batteries 1\n- - Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings 1\n- - Manufacture of hydrogen\n- - Manufacture of soda ash\n- - Manufacture of chlorine\n- - Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\n- - Manufacture of anhydrous ammonia\n- - Manufacture of nitric acid\n- - Manufacture of plastics in primary form\n\nCompared with 2021, the activity 'manufacture of carbon black' was no longer relevant in 2022 due to a plant shutdown.\n\nTo avoid double counting, assignment to an enabling activity is only made if a taxonomy-eligible product or project had not already been\n\n- 1 Enabling activity within the meaning of the E.U. taxonomy\n- 2 The production of heat/cool using waste heat was also partially covered by other activities.\n- 3 The criteria for the activity 'close to market research, development and innovation' (for example, a technology readiness level of at least six) were used to determine taxonomy-eligible research and development costs.\n\nincluded under another activity. BASF products also enable the production of technologies for renewable energy or low-carbon mobility. However, since the E.U. taxonomy focuses on the manufacture of technologies and thus excludes precursors, we have classified these activities as non-eligible under the E.U. taxonomy.\n\nIn  addition  to  our  core  business,  the  production  of  chemical products, we have identified further BASF activities that can be allocated to the following activities presented in the E.U. taxonomy: afforestation; electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology; production of heat/cool from bioenergy; production of heat/ cool using waste heat; electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels; high-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous fuels; production of heat/cool from fossil gaseous fuels in an efficient district heating and cooling system; close to market  research,  development  and  innovation.  These  activities made no material contribution 2 and were therefore generally classified as taxonomy-non-eligible. For the purposes of the templates set out in Annex/uni00A0XII to the Delegated Regulation 2021/2178, we would like to point out that we conduct activities in the areas of electricity generation, co-generation of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool from fossil gas. However, as presented above, these are not material. Furthermore, we would like to point out that we do not conduct any nuclear energy activities.\n\nBuildings constructed and operated by BASF, traffic facilities and central water supply and wastewater management systems may also fall under the E.U. taxonomy's description of activities in the areas 'Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation,'  'Transport,'  and  'Construction  and  real  estate  activities.' Potential contributions from such infrastructure-related activities that supported production were likewise immaterial and were generally classified as taxonomy-non-eligible.\n\nBASF does not report any taxonomy-eligible activities under the environmental objective of climate change adaptation . This is firstly to avoid double counting with economic activities already\n\nrecorded under the climate change mitigation objective. Secondly, in accordance with the notice issued by the E.U. Commission, a prerequisite for taxonomy eligibility under the adaptation objective is the submission of an investment plan for implementing adaptation solutions. BASF has not prepared any such plan.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible turnover, capital expenditures and operating   expenditures\n\nWe assessed the taxonomy eligibility of our turnover based on sales as defined and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements of  the  BASF/uni00A0 Group.  Taxonomy-eligible  turnover  accounted  for 13.3% of total sales in 2022. The largest contributions were from the activi ties  'manufacture of plastics in primary form' and 'manufacture of  organic basic chemicals.' Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (including  acquisitions and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 18.6% of the total investments reported in/uni00A0 the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures on the ' manufacture of organic basic chemicals' and in the 'manufacture of batteries' made the greatest contribution. Operating expenditures include non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, 3 maintenance and repair, and shortterm lease expenses. They are not reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements in/uni00A0 this form. All of the capital expenditures and operating expenditures of a  production facility with a taxonomy- eligible activity are counted as/uni00A0taxonomy- eligible.  Taxonomyeligible operating expenditures   accounted for 10.4% of  total oper ating expenditures. The largest contributions were from the  activities 'manufacture  of  organic  basic  chemicals'  and  'manufacture  of plastics in primary form.'\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating   expenditures\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible activities identified by BASF can be classified as  taxonomy-aligned  if  they  make  a  substantial  contribution  to climate change mitigation and do no significant harm to other environ mental objectives and, at the same time, ensure minimum social safeguards. The contribution to climate change mitigation and harm",

        "page_content": "to other environmental objectives were reviewed in a three-step process.  The first step involved a two-part analysis based on BASF's internal product databases:\n\n- - The manufacture of products is analyzed with respect to the use of critical substances in accordance with Annex/uni00A0C 1 of the E.U. Commission's Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to ensure significant pollution prevention or control according to the E.U. tax onomy. This also includes use in the production process. An assessment of the 'essential use' of the critical substances used in the sense of the opening clauses according to Annex/uni00A0 C, letters/uni00A0f) and g) has not been performed. The E.U. Commission announced further regulations on this in 2023.\n- - Plastics in primary form are analyzed with respect to the share of renewable raw materials in the product. They are only considered further if this share is at least 5% and thus potentially make a substantial  contribution  to  climate  change  mitigation  through partial or complete production from renewable raw materials. Shares allocated using mass balance approaches (see page/uni00A0121) are not taken into account here because their acceptance under the E.U. taxonomy has not yet been definitively clarified. For this reason, BASF products based on chemically recycled raw materials are not considered further in the assessment at present either. Mechanical recycling does not play any role for BASF here.\n\nIn the second step , it was assessed whether the potentially taxonomy-aligned products make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific criteria. Among other things, the greenhouse gas emissions of European and  non-European  plants  to  produce  soda  ash,  organic  basic chemicals and nitric acid were compared with the average values of the most efficient plants under the E.U. emissions trading system. For the production of hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia and plastics in primary form, the comparison was against activity-specific quantitative criteria, such as the energy or emission intensity of a product. This was based on a digital solution developed by BASF to determine product-specific carbon emissions (see page/uni00A0140).\n\n- 1 Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals\n- 2 Protection of water and marine resources is taken as given at sites that do not use or treat water.\n- 3 A radius of 3/uni00A0km around production sites was defined for the analysis of biodiversity-sensitive areas.\n\nFinally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the products identified cause significant harm to the other envi ron mental objectives. This included an analysis of risks arising from climate change using climate risk and vulnerability assessments. At sites with material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was additionally analyzed and evaluated. The avoidance of significant harm to water and marine resources, 2 biodiversity and ecosystems, 3 and pollution prevention and control were taken as given for production plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform regulatory requirements and additionally ensured through data queries. The conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a caseby-case basis. This was based on joint assessments by local and central experts using the evidence of local production requirements submitted.\n\nThe criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar of/uni00A0 taxonomy alignment in accordance with Article/uni00A0 18 of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation were reviewed for all activities across the BASF Group, independent of the step-by-step process for the 'contribution to climate change mitigation' and 'harm to other environmental objectives' criteria.\n\nThe recommendations of the E.U. Platform on Sustainable Finance of October 2022 on the four core topics of human rights (including labor rights), corruption/bribery, taxation and fair competition were taken into account here. Minimum social safeguards are to be ensured  by  a  systematic,  integrated  and  risk-based  approach to safe guarding our human rights due diligence obligations (see page/uni00A0109), by global labor and social standards (see page/uni00A0110), and by the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A0115), among other things.\n\nTaxonomy-aligned turnover accounted for 0.4% of the total sales revenue defined and reported in the BASF/uni00A0 Group's Consolidated Financial Statements in 2022. The 'manufacture of organic basic chemicals' made the largest contribution (0.3%). Tax onomy-aligned capital expenditures (including acquisitions and excluding goodwill in  accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 0.5% of the\n\ntotal investments reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 'manufacture of soda ash' contributed significantly here with 0.3%.  Taxonomy-aligned  operating  expenditures  accounted  for 0.9% of total operating expenditures, with the largest contribution from the economic activity 'manufacture of plastics in primary form' (0.5%).  It  is  not  possible  to  provide  information  on  changes in/uni00A0 taxonomy- aligned turnover, capital expenditures and operating expenditures as these are being reported for the first time in 2022.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned figure is significantly lower than the taxonomy-eligible figure due to various factors. Only a small proportion of plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable raw  materials above the threshold value. In many production processes, substances that fall within Annex/uni00A0 C 1 are used to prevent or reduce pollution. As a result, these processes are no longer taxonomyaligned, even if the substances are not released into the environment (for example, because they are exclusively used in a closed system in the production plant) and are used in accordance with existing chemicals legislation. This means, for example, that all production processes  for  the  manufacture  of  battery  materials  must  be assessed as not taxonomy-aligned. The proportion of taxonomyaligned  activities  is  also  reduced  by  the  fact  that  many  plants exceed the benchmarks used by the E.U. taxonomy, such as the E.U./uni00A0 emissions trading scheme. In addition, plants that are not subject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed using the specified criteria were generally classified as not taxonomy-aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on sales revenue, see Note/uni00A07 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 227 onward\n\nFor more information on investments, see Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 242 onward",

That is why we have firmly anchored the three pillars of sustainability/uni00A0the economy, environment and society/uni00A0- into our corporate purpose, our strategy, our targets and our operations along the value chain. They are at the core of what we do, a driver for growth and an element of our risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe contribute to sustainability and to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many ways (see page 46). For instance, our innovations, products and technologies help to use natural resources more efficiently, meet the demand for food, enable climate-smart mobility, reduce emissions and waste, and increase  the  capabilities  of  renewable  energy.  Alongside  these positive contributions, our business activities also have negative impacts. For example, we create CO2 emissions, use water and procure raw materials from suppliers, which may involve a potential risk of violating labor, environmental or social standards. This is why we are constantly working to broaden our positive contributions to key sustainability topics (see page/uni00A0 46) along our value chain and reduce the negative impacts.\n\nWe  are  committed  to  doing  business  in  a responsible,  safe, resource-efficient and respectful way. We are guided here by our corporate values and our global Code of Conduct. Our actions are based on the applicable laws and regulations. Some of our  voluntary commitments go above and beyond these. We stipulate globally binding rules for our employees with standards and  guidelines  that\n\napply throughout the Group. In doing so, we  consider, respect and promote internationally recognized principles such as the 10/uni00A0principles of the U.N. Global Compact and the Core Labor Standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO).\n\nWe want to ensure that we act in line with the applicable laws and uphold our responsibility to the environment and society with our comprehensive management and monitoring systems . Our Responsible Care Management System does this for environmental protection,  health  and  safety  (see  page/uni00A0 123).  We  meet  our responsibilities  with  respect  to  international  labor  and  social standards chiefly through three elements: the Compliance Program (see page/uni00A0179), close dialog with our stakeholders and the guideline on  compliance  with  international  labor  norms,  which  applies Group-wide.\n\nOur business partners are also expected to comply with prevailing laws, regulations and internationally recognized principles. We have established appropriate management and control systems, for example, for working with our suppliers (see page/uni00A0114).\n\nWe seek dialog with our stakeholders to discuss critical issues and,/uni00A0if necessary, develop solutions together. Through our societal engage ment, we want to create a positive impact, particularly in the communities surrounding our sites, and help solve global  challenges.\n\nWe are involved in numerous sustainability initiatives to drive forward sustainability in general and, specifically, as this relates to our value chains. These include the World Business Council for Sustainable  Development  (WBCSD)  as  well  as  networks  with thematic focus like the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) or the Global Battery Alliance (GBA). In addition, we realize a wide range of projects - often together with partners - for example, to improve sustainability in the supply chain or to promote a circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how we value people and treat them with respect, see page/uni00A0101 onward\n\nFor more information on responsible procurement, see page/uni00A0114 onward\n\nFor more information on safe and efficient production, see page/uni00A0123 onward",

Our employees play an important role here as ambassadors for BASF.\n\n## Number of employees\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the number of employees increased to 111,481/uni00A0 employees compared with 111,047/uni00A0 employees as of December/uni00A031, 2021. The rise was primarily due to staff increases in Asia Pacific, especially for the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. Furthermore, the Global Business Services unit contributed to a rise in  Germany,  Asia  Pacific  and  South  America.  In  addition,  the investment project to expand infrastructure and production plants for battery materials at the Schwarzheide site in Germany led to a rise in the number of employees. The divestiture of the kaolin minerals business and the suspension of business activities in Russia had an offsetting impact. We employed 3,049/uni00A0apprentices 1 (2021: 3,028). 2,468/uni00A0 employees were on temporary contracts (of which 47.4% were women).\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nBASF can rely on the engagement of its employees. This is shown by a passion for the job, a dedication to top performance and a strong commitment to BASF. Employee surveys and pulse checks are  used  as feedback  tools to  actively  involve  employees  in shaping their working environment. The results are communicated to employees, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, among others. We have performed regular global employee surveys since 2008. We aim to keep the high level of employee engagement determined by these surveys. As part of the BASF strategy, we therefore set ourselves the following goal in 2018: More than 80% of our employees feel that at BASF, they can thrive and perform  at  their  best.  We  regularly  calculate  the  employee engagement level as an index score based on five questions on set topics in our employee surveys.\n\nOverall, more than 75,900 employees worldwide participated in the 2022  survey  (participation  rate:  68% 2 ).  The  survey  revealed  an engagement index of 81%, which can be seen as stabilization at a high level (2020: 82%). Our aim is to keep this score above 80%. We support our leaders with a range of measures to  decentrally address individual action areas and in this way, help to further strengthen employee engagement together with their  employees.\n\n## What we expect from our leaders\n\nOur leaders and their teams should contribute to BASF's success. This  is  why  we  promote  high-quality  leadership  and  regularly measure its impact. We understand impactful leadership as leaders that serve as role models by having a positive influence on the engagement and development of their employees, and by developing and implementing business strategies in line with our corporate values. These aspects are part of the standard global nomination criteria for leadership positions.\n\nOur  leadership  culture  is  based  on  BASF's  corporate  values: creative,  open,  responsible  and  entrepreneurial  -  CORE.  Our specific expectations of leaders' conduct are derived from these: The CORE Leadership Values serve as the guiding principles for all leaders and set out our expectations of leadership conduct. They are aligned with BASF's strategic goals and reflect our company's leadership vision.\n\nWe offer our leaders a wide variety of learning and development opportunities for each phase of their career as well as various formats that enable them to learn from one another and external experts. Global and local offerings are optimally coordinated. We aim to develop leaders who lead their teams with professional competence, optimism, empathy and trust, and in this way, create a competitive advantage for BASF.\n\n- 1 At BASF, the apprenticeship program trains students for technical, scientific and business vocations as well as for trade and craft professions.\n- 2 Scope of employees surveyed goes beyond the scope of consolidation. However, there are exceptions for companies that represent joint ventures and joint operations, as well as companies held for sale.\n\nIn order to further anchor the CORE Leadership Values in  day-to-day life, two focus topics were defined for our leadership training in 2022: Continuous Meaningful Conversation s (see page/uni00A0 106) and Inclusive Leadership (see page/uni00A0 107). These virtual training courses comprised a series of modules that provided senior executives with opportunities for self-reflection, global exchange, and practicing and consolidating competencies and skills. Since summer 2022, we have also offered other management levels training and information on Continuous Meaningful Conversations and a deep dive into the CORE Leadership Values.\n\nRegular  feedback  also  plays  an  important  role  in  leadership development. In order to better reflect the anchoring of leadership values in daily leadership conduct, we have enhanced and refined our global feedback tool, FEEDback&forward. In 2022, more than 69,700 employees took advantage of the opportunity to provide feedback  to  their  leader  on  topics  such  as  trust,  empathy, empowerment, innovation and priority setting. Employees were also able to give feedback to their supervisors on the type of leadership behavior they would like to see in the future. In 2022, the majority of our leaders again received positive feedback, which shows that they also meet the high standards BASF requires from them in their day-to-day leadership behavior. The fact that 70% of our leaders have, in the eyes of their employees, further improved their leadership over the past year also points to a clear positive trend. In this way,  FEEDback&forward promotes regular and open dialog between  employees and leaders and encourages them to reflect on  themselves and their own performance. This enables teams to drive forward change together.",

        "page_content": "## Competition for talent\n\nAttracting and retaining the best employees is crucial to our  success. Having an attractive and compelling total offer package for  employees is becoming  increasingly  important  given  the  strong  global competition for the best qualified employees and leaders. This is why we are constantly working on measures to increase BASF's attractiveness in the global labor markets and are increasingly using digital platforms such as our country-specific career websites as well as global and regional social networks. This enables us to appropriately address different target groups.\n\nOur talent search activities in 2022 were based on a mix of face-to-face events as well as digital offerings. We are continually enhancing and refining these offerings to be able to respond to current developments and the changing needs of applicants, and additionally, to be able to provide the best possible information about BASF as an employer virtually. For example, we are represented at digital trade fairs and conferences. This virtual contact enables  a  demand-oriented,  flexible  and  location-independent approach. As a result, we were able to continue to attract and recruit  talented   employees.\n\nWe are also involved in long-term projects to promote talent, such as a pilot project run by the Royal Society of Chemistry to help ethnic minorities in the U.K. and Ireland pursue careers in the chemical industry. The launch event for the three-year program was held in London in September 2022.\n\nIn addition, we consistently take part in specific career events to directly reach and attract talent from various disciplines, especially female candidates. We focus in particular on our female employees as role models with various initiatives such as career fairs and networking events aimed specifically at women, or on our social media channels. In 2022, we also added a new page to the global career website that highlights our strategic targets on gender parity and on women in leadership positions.\n\nTo  combat  the  shortage  of  skilled  workers  in  production  and technical areas in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we used channels like social media to alert qualified specialists to career prospects at BASF in 2022. We also cooperated with the German employment agency,  for  example,  to  target  skilled  workers  at  informational events and to recruit suitable candidates for BASF who are  currently available on the labor market or will be in the near future.\n\nIn addition, we are working on implementing a digital onboarding process for new employees and their leaders in the period up to the first day of work and beyond. The plan is to roll out the Enboarder digital tool globally in 2023.\n\nWe offer a dual vocational training model at numerous sites. At production sites in the United States, for example, we provide up to three  years  of  dual-track  vocational  training  under  the  North American Apprenticeship Program (NAADP). We work with local colleges to ensure that apprentices receive comprehensive and integrated tuition, in addition to the practical experience they gain at BASF's sites. The program was expanded to additional U.S. sites in 2022.\n\nWe once again achieved high scores in a number of employer rankings in 2022. For example, in a study conducted by Universum, young  scientists  ranked  BASF  as  the  seventh  most  attractive employer in Germany (2021: second). In North America, DiversityInc named BASF as one of the top 50/uni00A0 companies for diversity in recruiting for the tenth consecutive year. In Asia, Top Employer recognized BASF China as one of the best employers for the thirteenth time in succession.\n\nThe  BASF/uni00A0 Group  hired  10,893/uni00A0 new  employees  in  2022.  The percentage of employees who resigned during their first three years of employment - the early turnover rate - was 1.9% worldwide in 2022. This turnover rate was 0.8% in Europe, 4.0% in North America, 3.8% in Asia Pacific and 2.8% in South America, Africa, Middle East.\n\n## BASF Group new hires in 2022\n\n|                                     | 2022   |   Of which women (%) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|\n| Europe                              | 4,809  |                 30.2 |\n| North America                       | 2,422  |                 28.6 |\n| Asia Pacific                        | 2,606  |                 30.6 |\n| South America, Africa, Middle  East | 1,056  |                 43.8 |\n| Total                               | 10,893 |                 31.2 |\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the BASF/uni00A0Group was training 3,049/uni00A0people in 11/uni00A0countries and around 50 occupations. We spent a total of around \u20ac131/uni00A0million on vocational training in 2022.\n\n- For more information on careers at BASF, see basf.com/career\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learning and development\n\nLearning and development are essential success factors for a strong and future-oriented company culture. The skills and competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth and lasting success. For this reason, we want to further modernize our learning culture and step up our efforts to promote continuous, self-directed learning and learning from others. Employee development at BASF is underpinned by the principle that development opportunities and support are open to all employees.\n\nWe understand development as continuous learning by building individual experience and skills, further training or changing jobs. A trust-based relationship between employees and leaders as well as regular feedback are crucial to employee development. Continuous Meaningful Conversations are regular conversations between leaders  and  employees  and  cover  topics  such  as  feedback, reflection, development, performance, collaboration and well-being. These conversations can be initiated by both leaders or employees and take different forms depending on individual needs - leaders and employees can agree on this in the annual employee dialog.",

        "page_content": "Employees also define their individual learning objectives together with their leader in these discussions. These are to be adapted to the specific requirements of the position concerned and future needs. Learning can take place in various formats and at different locations - at work, as social or formal learning - depending on current individual and workplace demands.\n\nOur learning offerings are available for a variety of employee develop ment needs: starting a career, expanding knowledge, personal growth  and  leadership  development.  In  addition,  the  many academies in the divisions and service units offer training on specific professional content.\n\nTo achieve our ambitious digitalization goals, we are focusing on digital skills development in the leadership team and among our employees, as well as on agile transformation. Learning offerings cover not only typical, IT-related fields of competence, but also production and sustainability topics, for example. Agile leadership training plays just as important a role as development activities that help employees and leaders navigate a digitally-enabled working environment, analyze data for more targeted decision-making or improve automation processes. BASF uses the concept of digital competence  profiles.  These  describe  digital  skills,  tasks  and behaviors and help harmonize digital skills requirements across BASF.\n\nAdditionally,  we  offer  our  employees  a  variety  of  self-learning opportunities to enhance their digital skills. The global Ways of Working  portal  was  launched  in  2021.  Over  one-third  of  our employees have already taken advantage of this offer. In 2022, around 28,600/uni00A0employees participated in events such as the global collaboration weeks, 'open house' question and answer sessions on  new  ways  of  working,  and  workshop  series  on  virtual collaboration. In addition, 600/uni00A0 colleagues volunteered as change agents and served as contacts on virtual collaboration topics. This enables social learning directly in the workplace. In addition, over\n\n5,200/uni00A0employees are active in the Ways of Working community on our social network.\n\nAlongside formal learning opportunities, the 'project marketplace' social  platform  offers  further  agile  development  opportunities. Employees are able to grow professionally by taking on new tasks without having to change jobs internally and benefit from the experience  they  gain  from  working  on  digital  projects.  Over 600/uni00A0 employees took up this offer in 2022.\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agile learning formats\n\nAgile learning formats are characterized by a high degree of self-organization on the one hand and cooperation on the other. At BASF, they are primarily applied directly in a working context, for example in the form of design thinking, learning circles or hackathons. With the regular Climathon initiative, for example, BASF aims to find and nurture solutions that advance  digitalization and sustainability together. In 2022, BASF also participated in the HerHackathon  2022,  where  250/uni00A0 female  digital  talents  from across  Europe  worked  on  seven  challenges  from  multiple companies. Participating in events of this kind helps us to be perceived as an attractive digital employer and to attract new talent.\n\nCitizen development is an important pillar of BASF's digitalization strategy. In IT jargon, citizen developers are the opposite of professional software developers - interested users who, after a short learning phase, independently create digital applications. There are now more than 10,000 citizen developers at BASF, who have access to various platforms to develop simple digital solutions themselves and strengthen BASF's digital  transformation.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation and benefits\n\nWe want to attract and retain engaged and qualified employees, and motivate them to achieve top performance with a total offer package that includes market-oriented compensation, individual development  opportunities  and  a  good  working  environment. Our employees' compensation is based on global compensation principles according to position, market and performance. As a rule, compensation comprises fixed and variable components as well as benefits that often exceed legal requirements. In many countries,  these  benefits  include  company  pension  benefits, supplementary health insurance and share programs. We regularly review our compensation systems at the global and local levels.\n\nWe want our employees to contribute to the company's success. This is why the compensation granted to the vast majority of our employees includes variable compensation components, with which they participate in the success of the BASF/uni00A0Group as a whole and are recognized for their individual performance. The same  principles essentially apply for all employees worldwide. The amount of the variable component is determined by economic success as well as the employee's individual performance. We use the BASF/uni00A0Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure  economic success for the purposes of variable compensation. This links variable compensation to our ROCE target. 1 Individual  performance is assessed as part of a globally consistent performance management process. In numerous Group companies, our 'plus' share program ensures  employees'  long-term  participation  in  the  company's success through incentive shares. In 2022, for  example, around 27,100/uni00A0 employees worldwide (2021: around 23,600) participated in/uni00A0the 'plus' share program.\n\nBASF offers senior executives the opportunity to participate in a long-term incentive (LTI) program 2 in the form of a performance share plan. The LTI program has a term of four years and takes into/uni00A0 account the development of the total shareholder return. It\n\n## Balancing personal and professional life\n\nOur identity as an employer includes our belief in supporting our employees in balancing their personal and professional lives. We want to strengthen their identification with the company and our position in the global competition for qualified personnel. To achieve this, we have a wide range of offerings aimed at employees in different phases of life that accommodate - as far as the job allows/uni00A0the growing demand for flexibility in when and where they work. These include flexible working hours, part-time employment, remote working, and time off options that provide the necessary flexibility to care for children or family members, for example. We are continually working to expand these options and increasingly support the effective use of digital solutions here.\n\nWe have formulated guidelines for more flexibility in where, when and how employees work. These opportunities have become an integral part of our employees' day-to-day work, job permitting.\n\nAt the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, teams can draw on many tools to live more flexibility and at the same time,  strengthen teamwork. Many BASF units have hybrid work models, working partly on-site and partly remotely. Desk-sharing concepts support the new form of collaboration and create areas to withdraw as well as new interaction spaces for sharing ideas and being creative together. There are also external and internal co-working opportunities that employees can take advantage of.\n\nOur  Work-Life  Management  employee  center  in  Ludwigshafen, Germany, (LuMit) offers a number of services under one roof: childcare, fitness and health, and the Employee Assistance Program with social counseling services offered by BASF/uni00A0Stiftung.\n\nOther BASF sites also have a wide range of services to foster a balance between personal and professional life and promote health and fitness. For example, the M\u00fcnster and Frankfurt sites in Gemany\n\n- 1 In calculating compensation-relevant ROCE, adjustments are made for negative and positive special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures (for example, integration costs in connection with acquisitions and gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses) when these exceed a corridor of +/-1% of the average cost of capital basis. An adjustment of the compensation-relevant ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.\n- 2 The LTI program referred to here is aimed at management levels/uni00A02 to 4 as well as individual employees who have attained senior executive status by virtue of special expertise.\n\nincen tivizes the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability targets. To take part in this program, participants must hold BASF shares, the amount of which is based on their individual fixed compensation. In 2022, around 94% of the people eligible to participate in the LTI around the world did so, holding between 30% and 70% of their fixed annual compensation in BASF shares. The share price-based compensation program (BASF Option Program, BOP), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020.\n\n- For more information on share price-based compensation programs and BASF's share programs, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page/uni00A0285 onward\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Personnel expenses\n\nExpenses for wages and salaries, social security contributions and assistance, as well as for pensions totaled \u20ac11,400/uni00A0million in 2022. In the previous year, these amounted to \u20ac11,097/uni00A0million. The rise was mainly attributable to a higher wage and salary level, currency effects, particularly from the U.S. dollar, as well as a higher average number  of  employees.

In addition, BASF/uni00A0Stiftung promotes projects  around  the  world  to  permanently  improve  the  living conditions  of  people  in  need  and  to  help  people  affected  by emergencies and natural disasters. Examples include the year-end donation campaign '#HornOfAfrica - Children need water and food' and the major donation campaign '#ColleaguesForUkraine'. The site  in  Lemf\u00f6rde,  Germany,  also  hosted  an  aid  campaign  for Ukrainian refugees, organizing a leisure program for a total of around 45/uni00A0 refugee children and their mothers as part of summer holiday care.\n\nWe have also offered our South American employees numerous support services for many years now. For example, there is a team that  coordinates  activities  to  promote  employees'  emotional, physical  and  social  well-being.  The  portfolio  is  continuously enhanced and refined to optimally meet current local needs. One focus topic in 2022 was burnout and illness prevention.\n\nIn  Asia,  too,  many  countries  have  specific  support  programs designed  to  help  employees  with  personal  and  professional problems. These include a wide range of offers, for example on mental health and on preventing and dealing with stress.

That is why our stakeholder dialog is based on honesty, respect and mutual trust . This also applies to dialog with our employees.\n\nAll employees have the opportunity to form, join and support legally recognized trade unions or employee representatives. These are entitled to represent employees and their interests in collective bargaining. BASF upholds these rights and has anchored this in the Group-wide guideline on compliance with international labor norms.\n\nTrust-based  cooperation  with  employee  representatives  is  an important  component  of  our  corporate  culture.  Our  open  and continual dialog lays the foundation for balancing the interests of the company and its employees, even in challenging situations. In 2022, this underpinned our efforts to manage the effects of the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic, for example. In the case of organizational changes or if restructuring leads to staff downsizing, for example, or in the case of other codetermination-relevant topics, we involve employee representatives at an early stage to develop socially  responsible  implementation  measures.  Our  actions  are aligned with the respective legal regulations and the agreements reached, as well as operational conditions.\n\nBy focusing our discussions on the local and regional situations, we aim to find tailored solutions to the different challenges and legal conditions for each site. The BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) addresses cross-border matters in Europe. In South America, we foster continual dialog with employee representatives in the Di\u00e1logo Social.\n\nWe are also committed to social dialog with employee  representatives where freedom of association is not guaranteed under national law to the same extent as in European legal systems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a global company, we serve many different customer needs. We also/uni00A0 want to reflect this diversity in our workforce. By valuing and promoting employee diversity, we boost our teams' performance and power of innovation, and increase creativity,  motivation  and employees' identification with the company.\n\nWe expect inclusive conduct from all employees. By this, we mean creating an environment in which different aspects of diversity and individual strengths are valued. That is why in 2022, we focused on/uni00A0 the topics of inclusion and our employees' sense of belonging at/uni00A0BASF.\n\nOur leaders play an important role in promoting diversity and  creating an  inclusive  work  environment.  We  support  them  with  various offerings, for example as part of leadership development. In 2022, our leaders had the opportunity to deep dive into inclusive leadership in a training series on the CORE Leadership Values (see page/uni00A0 102). The training supported our leaders in what they can specifically do to make the work environment more inclusive for all employees and how they can live up to their role model function and develop further.\n\nTo fulfill their responsibility for creating an inclusive workplace, all leaders in North America have been required since 2022 to set goals for the inclusive leadership of their teams. These are incorporated\n\ninto  their  respective  target  agreements  and  implementation  is reviewed.  Market  regions  and  countries  in  Europe  developed individual diversity and inclusion roadmaps in 2022. The focus was on identifying the relevant topics in each country. In addition, since 2022 we have also been using the inclusion index to measure our employees' sense of belonging as part of the regular employee survey (see page/uni00A0102).\n\nIntegrating different perspectives is very important to BASF and we want to create a greater awareness of diversity in our organization. For  instance,  we  have  created  a  digital  learning  format  on unconscious bias for all employees.

That  is  why  we  have embedded our responsibility for human rights into our Code of Conduct and set this out in our Policy Statement on Human Rights. We uphold our standards worldwide, including where they exceed local legal require ments. All employees and leaders are responsible for ensuring that we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct and our Policy Statement on Human Rights. In everything we do, we\n\nare  committed  to  complying  with  international  labor  and  social standards.\n\nWe  rely  on  a  systematic,  integrated,  risk-based  approach  and established monitoring and management systems . BASF is also active in initiatives such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) and Responsible  Care \u00ae , which promote sustainability in the supply chain. Our measures and criteria for monitoring and respecting human rights are integrated into supplier assessment processes and our global monitoring systems for environmental protection, safety and security, health protection and product stewardship (see page/uni00A0114). They are also part of the evaluation of investment, acquisition and divestiture projects, assessments along the entire product life cycle, and systems to monitor labor and social standards. In addition, aspects of human rights topics are part of the global qualification requirements  for  security  personnel  and  are  incorporated  into standard agreements with contractors.\n\nOur compliance unit is responsible for steering human rights topics and coordinates cross-unit collaboration.

It includes employees from specialist departments - Corporate Compliance (coordination),  Global  Procurement,  Corporate  Legal,  Corporate Human Resources, Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality, Corporate Strategy & Sustainability, Corporate Security, Digital and Procurement Governance, Corporate Communications and Governmental Relations - and our operating divisions. The expert working group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. In this way, we want to ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility holistically and that we can continually improve our performance.\n\n## International labor and social standards\n\nOur aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in our global Code of Conduct through our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor and social standards. This encompasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In order to meet the requirement to comply with these standards worldwide, we mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations) and the BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group-wide. This guideline concretizes the topics in our global Code of Conduct under 'Human rights, labor and social standards' as these relate to our employees. In 2022, an additional guideline specified that these topics must also be considered and applied when working with temporary employees and freelancers.\n\nIt forms the basis for our global, risk-based management process: We regularly monitor changes to the national law of all the countries\n\nin which BASF operates and evaluate our adherence to international labor and social standards. If the national law contains no or lower requirements, action plans are drawn up to successively close these gaps in a reasonable time frame. If conflicts with national law or practices arise, we strive to act in accordance with our values and internationally recognized principles without violating the law of the country concerned. As part of the management process, we regularly follow up on and document the results of the comparison between national law and our guideline, as well as measures to implement the guideline. This is part of our central due diligence system.\n\nWe monitor our voluntary commitment to international labor and social standards as part of our management process. As before, individual elements of the guideline are also reviewed as part of internal  control  processes  such  as  Responsible  Care  audits  at BASF/uni00A0 Group companies. In addition to these quality assurance\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Human Rights Advisory Council\n\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human  rights  topics  helps  us  to  better  understand  different perspectives and to deal more openly with critical situations. The/uni00A0 meetings held in 2022, which were chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer, were attended by representatives from the Corporate Compliance and Corporate Strategy/uni00A0& Sustainability departments as well as other experts from the operating divisions or procurement as required. We maintained our dialog with the Human Rights Advisory Council in 2022, both with the body as a/uni00A0 whole and in small groups. The Council provided an external perspective, for example, on the further development of our human rights position, on due diligence in challenging circumstances, and on the limits of corporate governance.\n\nmeasures, compliance with international labor and social standards is an integral part of the standard questionnaire in the compliance management audits conducted by the Corporate Audit department.\n\n- For more information on corporate governance and compliance, see page/uni00A0168 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on labor and social standards, see basf.com/labor\\_social\\_standards\n\n## Cooperation along our value chains\n\nAs an international company, we are a part of society in the countries in which we operate and have business relationships with partners around the world. We are confronted by the fact that there are states that do not honor their obligation to protect human rights. People are particularly at risk in such countries, and companies' ability to act is often very limited. Here, too, we are committed to our values and contribute to the respect of human rights.\n\nWe have trustful working relationships with our partners (customers, suppliers,  joint  venture  partners,  contractors),  expect  them  to comply  with  internationally  recognized  human  rights  standards and to expect the same of their partners further along the value chain. We work to ensure that our partners meet their respective responsibilities.\n\nWe can only achieve our goal of strengthening respect for human rights along our value chains if we work together. We have clearly defined our expectations in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We are in close contact with our business partners, especially in higherrisk areas and regions, and monitor the implementation of relevant standards  and  necessary  measures  for  improvement.  We  use recognized assessments and audits to verify this. In 2022, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, where we usually have no direct contractual relationships, less transparency and less influence. Here, we seek to increase our influence through collaboration with partners and stakeholders, and place importance on certifications such as the LBMA certificate for gold, the LPPM certificate for platinum group metals, and the Responsible Minerals Initiative's Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.",

These measures are also important against the background of new regulations, especially the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCA). These include the appointment of BASF's Chief Human Rights Officer and the further development of our Policy Statement on Human Rights, including further explanations of our approach to human rights due diligence and priority risks for our company. Both of these measures were approved by the Board of Executive Directors in November 2022.\n\nTo strengthen due diligence in the supply chain, we have also enhanced and refined a range of measures, including supplier risk analysis as well as preventive measures such as the systematic business partner due diligence for new suppliers, our Supplier Code of Conduct, and the requirements to be embedded in suppliers' contracts. We continue to expect our suppliers to enforce our standards at their suppliers and subcontractors, too. Furthermore, the rights of third-party workers in high-risk countries will be even better protected in the future through additional due diligence steps. These  include  risk-based  controls  and  measures  that  promote transparency and awareness of human rights issues.\n\nWe have also been able to analyze and confirm BASF's compliance with  the  specific  environmental  treaties  covered  by  the  SCA ( Minamata, Stockholm, Basel) in countries that have not yet ratified these conventions.\n\n## Information and awareness-raising measures, grievance mechanisms\n\nPromoting awareness of human rights was again a focus topic in/uni00A0 2022. Workshop programs on this were held in our operating divisions. In addition, employees in all regions were informed about and sensitized to human rights topics through presentations and discussion formats for specific target groups.\n\nOur grievance mechanisms, which we already improved in 2021 with the introduction of a standardized global hotline and reporting system, were also used in 2022. A total of 151/uni00A0human rights-related complaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail (2021: 206). All complaints were reviewed and forwarded to the relevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appropriate measures were taken. The 65 closed and justified cases were primarily harassment cases, followed by cases of discrimination. Our grievance channels did not identify any instances of child labor or forced labor.\n\nWe report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures to integrate human rights topics into our business activities in publications such as this report and online.\n\n- For more information on our production standards, see page 125 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See basf.com/humanrights for more information on the Policy Statement on Human Rights and a comprehensive report on the implementation of due diligence in accordance with the requirements of the National Action Plan developed by the German government, and in accordance with the U.N./uni00A0Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nFor more information on the Human Rights Advisory Council, see basf.com/human-rights-council",

Through our activities, we want to strengthen the communities surrounding our sites worldwide, help achieve the SDGs, and have a positive long-term impact on the environment and society. Based on our business model and competencies, we aim to support and protect health, skills and resources,  contributing to a sustainable future for individuals and society.\n\nOne example of our contribution to public health is our cooperation with the non-governmental organization (NGO) Beyond Suncare, which aims to protect people with albinism from skin cancer, discrimination and attacks. The NGO has a long history of working with BASF to develop and provide sunscreen products that address the specific challenges of people with albinism in the sub-Saharan region. BASF provides its know-how and ingredients free of charge. Together,  Beyond  Suncare  and  BASF  developed  an  innovative sunscreen product that reduces the risk of skin cancer among the vulnerable population. This is just one example of how this initiative is improving the quality of life, safety and dignity of people with albinism in Africa.\n\nSince 2011, they have been complemented by the Virtual Lab, which has been used by around half a million children to date.\n\nBASF aims to contribute to more education for sustainable development with  the  Young  Voices  for  a  Sustainable  Future project. More than 1,000/uni00A0young people across eight countries were empowered to recognize and address the consequences of climate change in their communities. With their project proposals, participants used their potential to draw attention to challenges and help to eliminate them. The young people were supported by more than 80/uni00A0BASF employees.\n\nWe aim to create long-term value for BASF and society with new/uni00A0business models and cross-sector partnerships. Our Starting Ventures  program helps people from low-income areas to improve their economic opportunities and their quality of life. The program also provides access to new markets and partners and contributes to achieving the SDGs. Eight new Starting Ventures projects were selected for implementation in December 2022. BASF is tackling challenges on the ground together with local partners and contributing to the SDGs with entrepreneurial ideas, technical expertise and time resources. One project under our Starting Ventures program is the Waste-2-Chemicals project in Lagos, Nigeria. In the project, plastic waste is collected by local residents, sorted and then converted into pyrolysis oil. This pyrolysis oil is available as feedstock for the production of high-quality chemical products. In cooperation with nonprofit organizations, this enables local waste collectors and their families to earn a regular income.\n\nEducation is key to personal success and the future viability of society. That is why BASF is committed to working with partners at numerous sites to achieve greater educational equality, especially for   disadvantaged children and young people. BASF has been foster ing curiosity and stimulating an interest in science for 25/uni00A0years now with/uni00A0 BASF Kids' Labs . The experimentation programs have since reached approximately 1.2/uni00A0 million children in 45/uni00A0 countries.\n\n- 1 We report a total figure for our societal engagement activities. The figure includes all consolidated companies with employees, including joint operations.\n\n## BASF Group expenses for societal engagement activities 1\n\n## ~\u20ac30 million\n\nIn the area of international development cooperation , we support the independent charitable BASF Stiftung with donations for its projects in cooperation with various organizations. The 2022 yearend donation campaign in favor of BASF Stiftung supported the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, to provide children and their families in the Horn of Africa with access to food and water. BASF topped up the donations made by employees of participating German Group companies to a total of around \u20ac458,000.\n\nIn 2022, BASF also made donations to support people affected by the Russian attack on Ukraine. To this end, BASF initially provided \u20ac1/uni00A0 million in emergency aid to the German Red Cross in February 2022. In April, BASF additionally doubled the amount donated as part of the global employee fundraising campaign '#Colleagues ForUkraine' (\u20ac2,110,156 in total) to around \u20ac4.2/uni00A0million. The donations benefited BASF employees from Ukraine through BASF Stiftung and/uni00A0Ukrainian refugees through the U.N. Refugee Agency.\n\nIn addition, BASF supported those affected by natural disasters. For example, we support the National Disaster Management Authority in Pakistan with mosquito nets and pest control products to protect the population in flooded areas.\n\nFor more information on Starting Ventures, see basf.com/en/starting-ventures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on societal engagement at our sites, see ludwigshafen.basf.de\n\nFor more information on our societal engagement around the world, see basf.com/en/engagement",

Alongside economic and qualitative criteria, we also take environmental, social and ethical aspects into account in  cooperating with our suppliers. 2\n\nOur sustainability-oriented supply chain management is an integral part of our risk management. We have defined our standards in a global guideline. We are continually refining and optimizing this guideline and our structures and processes in response to changing conditions, such as the new obligations arising from the German Supply  Chain  Due  Diligence  Act (SCA),  which  requires  large companies to conduct due diligence on human rights and certain environmental standards in their supply chains from January/uni00A0 1, 2023. In principle, this applies both to our own business operations and to direct and indirect suppliers. Based on a gap analysis of the new statutory due diligence obligations, we have further  strengthened existing  structures  and  processes  and  summarized  our  human rights positions in a policy statement (see page/uni00A0 109). The head of  the  legal  and  compliance  organization  was  appointed  Chief Human Rights Officer in 2022 and is responsible in this capacity for  overseeing the supply chain risk management system. Our established supply chain management tools, such as our Supplier\n\nIn this section: Supplier Management Raw Materials\n\nCode of Conduct or the systematic risk-oriented assessment and auditing of suppliers, remain important elements and have been updated accordingly.\n\nProcurement  guidelines  and  targets  are  set  centrally  by  the responsible Corporate Center unit and are binding for all employees with procurement responsibility worldwide. We use a multi-stage control process to ensure compliance with these requirements.\n\nOur risk-based approach aims to identify and evaluate sustainability matters in our value chains as best possible to improve  sustainability performance together with our suppliers. We regularly review and document progress based on the risk level. Procurement employees receive regular training in sustainability-oriented supplier management and responsible procurement. In 2022, around 1,400/uni00A0 employees received  such  training,  covering  the  requirements  arising  from the/uni00A0SCA.\n\nWe  depend  on  reliable  and  long-term  supply  relationships.

They supply us with raw materials, energy, precursors, investment goods and consumables, perform a range of services and are innovation partners. We acquired raw materials, goods and services for our own production worth approximately \u20ac54/uni00A0billion in 2022. Of this, around 90% was procured locally. 1 There were no substantial changes to our supplier structure.\n\n## What we expect from our suppliers\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain. Consequently, we require our suppliers to comply with the applicable laws in full and to adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. We also expect our suppliers to make an effort to enforce these standards at their suppliers. In addition, we ask our suppliers to support and comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct - or to demonstrate and ensure their commitment to the principles specified in the Code of Conduct, for example in their own code of conduct.\n\nOur global Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations' Global  Compact,  the  U.N.  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions, and the topic areas of the Responsible Care initiative. Topics covered by the Code of Conduct include compliance with human rights, the exclusion of child and forced labor, safeguarding labor and social standards, antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies, and protecting the environment. The Code of Conduct is available in the most relevant languages for our suppliers and  integrated  into electronic ordering systems and purchasing  conditions across the Group. In 2022, we expanded our Supplier Code of Conduct to include requirements from the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Around 5,400/uni00A0new suppliers committed to the Code of Conduct in 2022.\n\nBASF conducts audits and assessments to ensure that suppliers comply with the applicable laws, rules and standards. BASF  reserves the right to discontinue business relationships for non-adherence to international  principles.  The  same  applies  to  failure  to  correct violations, or for displaying patterns of non-compliance with these standards. Our Code of Conduct expressly points out that potential violations of laws, rules or standards can be reported - including anonymously - to our compliance hotlines. Each case is  documented and investigated, and appropriate measures are taken as necessary.\n\n## Selection and evaluation of our suppliers\n\nNew suppliers are selected and existing suppliers are evaluated not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also ESG standards. As such, selection, evaluation and auditing is an important part of our sustainable supply chain and risk management. Processes and responsibilities are defined in a global guideline. Due to the large number of suppliers, they are evaluated based on risk. We take into account both country and industry-specific risks and the materiality of  the  supply  relationship.  We  also  use  observations  from  our employees  in  procurement  and  information  from  internal  and external  databases,  such  as  Together  for  Sustainability  (TfS) assessments (see box on page/uni00A0116).\n\nWe have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The list of suppliers to be assessed is updated every year. Sustainability evaluations and on-site audits are mainly conducted according to the TfS framework. A total of 79/uni00A0raw materials supplier sites were audited on sustainability standards on our behalf in 2022. We received sustainability evaluations for 963/uni00A0 suppliers. We also take into account other certification systems and external audits, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, when assessing our suppliers. Depending on business requirements, we additionally conduct our own Responsible Care audits at selected suppliers (see page/uni00A0123).",

        "page_content": "## Audit results\n\nWe carefully analyze the results of our assessments and document them in a central database. Over the past few years, we have identified some need for adjustment at our suppliers with respect to environmental, social and governance standards, for example in waste management, or deviations in occupational health and safety measures and standards under labor law. Follow-up audits performed in 2022 identified improvements in these areas. Again in 2022, none of our audits identified any instances of forced labor, child labor or dangerous work and overtime performed by persons under 18.\n\nWe maintained close dialog with our South African platinum supplier Sibanye-Stillwater 1 in 2022 on the results of the audit from 2020, the implementation of the resulting action plan, and other relevant topics. This includes working with stakeholders to take a unified approach  to  local  community  development.  All  the  needs  for adjustment identified in the 2020 audit had been addressed by the end of 2022. BASF and Sibanye-Stillwater have agreed that future audits will follow the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) mining standard. Sustainability topics are discussed on a quarterly basis. Sibanye-Stillwater is a member and supporter of the International Platinum Group Metals Association (IPA) sustainability initiative that was co-founded by BASF. Measures include  conducting comprehensive sustainability audits and sharing factors for success. The regular dialog with stakeholders continued in 2022. In addition, Sibanye-Stillwater  has  directly  involved  relevant  stakeholders  in Germany and South Africa in its own stakeholder dialog.\n\nIn  2022,  the  war  of  aggression  in  Ukraine  also  impacted  the business  relationship  with  our  Russian  raw  materials  supplier Nornickel . This could not be continued to the extent planned. We nevertheless maintain regular dialog with Nornickel, are monitoring the situation and events from a sustainability perspective, and are in contact with civil society groups. Topics addressed include the findings from the mining-specific TfS audits. TfS audits were carried\n\nout at Nornickel's site in Polar, Russia, in the fourth quarter of 2021. The results of these audits were discussed with Nornickel and follow-up measures were evaluated. Nornickel continues to seek membership in internationally recognized industry initiatives that provide third-party verification of mining and responsible  procurement standards, such as IRMA or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). However, this is only possible to a limited extent in the current  environment.\n\n## Supplier development\n\nIf supplier assessments identify deviations from standards, we ask suppliers to develop and implement corrective measures within a reasonable time frame in a clearly defined follow-up process. We support them in their efforts. In South America, for example, over 300/uni00A0employees of suppliers participated in a webinar on compliance and human rights in the supply chain. Together with Mercedes-Benz, we also organized a workshop in the region focusing on gender equality, which was attended by 22/uni00A0logistics service providers. An important  part  of  supplier  development  in  2022  was  also  the sustainability webinars held by TfS together with EcoVadis in various languages, with a total of over 1,900/uni00A0participants. In addition, the new TfS Academy online learning platform is aimed at buyers and suppliers. It covers the entire spectrum of ESG topics. There are currently over 335/uni00A0courses available in 10 different languages.\n\nWe review our suppliers' progress according to a defined time frame based on the sustainability risk identified, or after five years at the latest. In the case of serious violations of the standards defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct or international principles, we reserve the right to impose commercial sanctions. These can go as far as termination of the business relationship. In 2022, this happened in one case.\n\n- 1 In 2012, an extended strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police. Employees of the former mine operator, Lonmin, were among the fatalities. Ownership of the Marikana mine was transferred to Sibanye-Stillwater in 2019. For more information on the supplier relationship with the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, see basf.com/en/marikana\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Together for Sustainability (TfS)\n\nBASF is a founding member of Together for Sustainability. The initiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the supply chain. The focus is on the standardization, simplification and  mutual  recognition  of  supplier  audits  and  assessments. Suppliers are evaluated by independent experts either in on-site audits or online assessments. The latter are conducted by EcoVadis, a ratings agency  specialized in sustainability evaluations. At the end of 2022, TfS had 40/uni00A0 members with a combined procurement spend of around \u20ac400/uni00A0billion. A total of 378/uni00A0 audits and 8,386/uni00A0 online assessments were performed in 2022. As a TfS member, BASF itself is assessed and in 2022 was again ranked among the top 1% companies worldwide in the sustainable procurement category. BASF is involved in the further development of TfS, for example, in  activities to  stan dard ize the calculation of Scope/uni00A0 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain (see page/uni00A0139).",

We want to use these resources efficiently and responsibly. The BASF Verbund and our focus on the circular economy are key strategic  building  blocks  here.  We  expect  our  suppliers to source and produce raw materials in line with environmental and social requirements. We support them as part of our  supplier  management,  for  example,  or  with  various sustainability projects along the raw materials supply chain.\n\n## At a glance\n\n~35,000 different raw materials purchased\n\n## 1.2/uni00A0million\n\nmetric  tons renewable raw materials purchased\n\n- /uni25AA BASF's Verbund concept enables the efficient use of resources\n- /uni25AA Recycled and renewable raw materials are gaining in importance\n- /uni25AA Numerous projects to improve supply chain sustainability\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nOur  strategy  covers  the  entire  value  chain  -  from  responsible procure ment and the efficient use of raw materials in our own processes  and  recycling  by-products  to  developing  resourcesaving solutions for our customers. We want to decouple growth from  resource consumption with process and product innovations and to accelerate the shift toward closed-loop systems .\n\n- A  Corporate  Center  unit  sets  binding,  Group-wide  purchasing guidelines for raw materials procurement. They are supplemented\n\nby  specific  internal  requirements,  for  example,  on  sourcing palm-based raw materials or certain mineral raw materials. We use a/uni00A0 multi-stage control process to ensure compliance with these requirements.\n\nAlongside  economic,  environmental  and  social  criteria,  we  also consider aspects such as product safety and supply security when selecting suppliers and raw materials. Our expectations of our suppliers are laid down in our Supplier Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A0 115). We take a closer look at suppliers in critical supply chains, for  example, mineral raw materials and renewable resources, a number of pigments and highly toxic substances.  Upstream stages of the value chain are assessed for serious  sustainability risks and, if  necessary, suitable remedial measures are identified. In addition, we develop and test approaches to make the supply of raw materials more sustainable in joint initiatives with suppliers and other partners.  Examples include our cooperative ventures and investments for  recycling lithium-ion batteries (see page/uni00A0120) and our joint activities on certified sustainable supply chains for renewable raw materials such as palm, palm kernel and  castor/uni00A0oil.\n\nBASF's Verbund concept is key to making the use of raw materials in our own processes as efficient as possible: Intelligently linking and steering our plants and processes creates efficient value chains. By-products from one facility are used as feedstocks elsewhere. This saves raw materials and energy. At the same time, the Verbund offers  many  opportunities  to  use  renewable  and  recycled  raw materials. We want to better leverage this potential going forward and gradually replace fossil resources with renewable energies and alternative feedstocks, both in our energy supply (see page/uni00A0 137) and in our production.\n\nResource efficiency and stewardship are also becoming  increas ingly important for our customers. That is why we are constantly working to reduce the resources consumed in the manufacturing of/uni00A0 our products,  for  example  through  more  efficient  processes  and innovative technologies. This enables us to offer our customers solutions that make a greater contribution to sustainability, like a smaller  carbon footprint or better biodegradability. Our products\n\nalso improve resource efficiency and sustainability at many points along the value chain. For example, BASF additives increase the service life and mechanical recyclability of plastics, which saves fossil resources, reduces CO2 emissions and enables a circular economy.\n\nFor more information on our supplier management, see page/uni00A0114 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the circular economy, see page/uni00A043\n\n## Fossil and petrochemical resources\n\nBASF's most important raw materials (based on volume) include gas and crude oil-based petrochemical products such as naphtha and benzene. We mainly use liquid gas and natural gas as a fuel to generate energy and steam, and as a raw material to produce key basic chemicals such as ammonia or acetylene. Naphtha is mainly fed into our steam cracker, where it is split into products such as ethylene and propylene - both important feedstocks for numerous BASF value chains. We use aromatics such as benzene or toluene to manufacture engineering plastics, among other products. Thanks to a high degree of forward and backward integration, we can produce feedstocks for our value chains efficiently while conserving resources within the BASF Verbund. This increases supply security and strengthens our resilience to fluctuations in the supply chain. We source key raw materials from different suppliers to minimize supply risks.\n\nAs part of our efforts to improve sustainability, we are continuously investigating whether fossil and petrochemical resources can be replaced  with  non-fossil  or  recyclate-based  alternatives.  When making decisions, we take into account economic, environmental and social aspects, as well as other important criteria like supply security, and process and product safety.",

        "page_content": "## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BASF's natural gas supply in Europe\n\nNatural gas is one of BASF's most important feedstocks. We use it as a fuel for energy supply as well as a raw material for the production of basic chemicals. BASF's natural gas demand in Europe was 32/uni00A0terawatt hours in 2022. The Ludwigshafen site in Germany accounted for around 24/uni00A0 terawatt hours, with around 50% used for central electricity and steam generation.\n\nThe supply situation for natural gas in Europe has changed significantly with the war in Ukraine and the progressive loss of Russian gas supplies. Although all of BASF's European sites could be supplied from our Western European suppliers in line with demand in 2022, this was at significantly higher and volatile prices. Compared with 2021, the additional cost of natural gas for BASF's European sites totaled \u20ac2/uni00A0billion; compared with 2020, the  increase was as much as \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion.\n\nSince March 2022, we have reduced our natural gas demand in Europe  through  various  measures.  These  include  technical optimizations in BASF's production network and switching to other\n\nfuels  wherever  possible.  In  addition,  we  reduced  production volumes at some plants with a high natural gas demand and purchased raw materials such as ammonia.\n\nWe  are  continuously  monitoring  the  market  and  political environment and will decide what adjustments we may have to make in supply and production depending on the situation. The same applies in the event of a potential gas shortage, which would result in national gas allocation in Germany. If this were to occur, we currently assume that BASF would receive sufficient natural gas to maintain operations at the Ludwigshafen site at a reduced load.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to reduce our dependence on fossil energy, especially natural gas, even faster. Our focus here is on further increasing energy efficiency, a rapid switch to renewable energies in the power supply, and new electricity-based  production technologies (see page/uni00A0135).\n\n## Renewable resources\n\nIn addition to fossil resources, we employ renewable raw materials, mainly based on vegetable oils, fats, grains, sugar and wood. In 2022, we purchased around 1.2/uni00A0 million metric tons of renewable raw materials. We use these to produce ingredients for the  detergent and cleaner industry and natural active  ingredients for the cosmetics industry, for example. We also use renewable  feedstocks such as biomethane and bio-naphtha in our Verbund as an alternative to fossil resources. The mass balance approach  allows us to allocate the amount of renewable resources used to a wide variety of end products (see box on page/uni00A0121). Examples  include biomass balance coating solutions for the automotive industry such as CathoGuard \u00ae /uni00A0 800 ReSource and iGloss \u00ae matt ReSource, various biomass balance versions of Trilon \u00ae and  Sokalan \u00ae products for the detergent and cleaner industries, or biomass  balance styrene as a precursor for numerous styrenics, including the insulating materials Styropor \u00ae , Neopor \u00ae and Styrodur \u00ae .\n\nOur aim is to continuously increase the share of renewable raw materials in our value chains. As for fossil raw materials, we also consider economic criteria, aspects of supply security, and process and product safety, as well as the potential impact on  sustainability along  the  value  chain.  Alongside  positive  effects  like  reducing greenhouse gas emissions, these can also have negative effects on areas  such  as  biodiversity,  land  use  or  working  conditions, depending on the raw material. This is why we carefully weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable resources, for example with Eco-Efficiency Analyses. At the same time, we seek dialog with our stakeholders to raise awareness of conflicting goals. We also take into consideration recognized certification standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in our decisions.\n\nAs part of our commitment to greater sustainability, we concentrate on value chains that are relevant quantitatively or that do not yet have  certification  standards.  We  are  also  working  on  product innovations and on enhancing our production processes to improve the profitability and competitiveness of renewable resources. For",

We  mainly  use  these  raw materials  to  produce  ingredients  for  the  cosmetics,  detergent, cleaner and food industries. We aim to ensure that palm-based raw materials come from certified sustainable sources. We have been a member of the RSPO since 2004 and are involved in other  national and international initiatives, such as the German Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil and the High Carbon Stock Approach  organization. Based on our Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A0115), we have outlined our expectations of suppliers in the palm-based value chain in an additional sourcing policy (BASF Palm Sourcing Policy). This addresses aspects such as forest and peat conservation, respect of human and labor rights, smallholder  inclusion, and certification and traceability standards. As part of our supplier and risk management, we have used the internet platform palmoil.io since 2021 to monitor deforestation activities and other possible breaches of regulations at our suppliers' sites. The annual BASF Palm Progress Report reports on our measures and progress toward more sustainability and transparency in the value chain.\n\nWe purchased 191,714/uni00A0metric tons of palm oil and palm kernel oil in 2022 (2021: 242,946/uni00A0metric tons). We again met our own voluntary commitment to source only RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel oil. This avoided more than 290,000/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 emissions compared with the procurement of conventional palm oil and palm kernel oil. We were able to trace 97% of our global palm footprint to oil mill level as of the end of 2022 (2021: 96%). In addition, we maintained the RSPO supply chain certification of our sites for cosmetic ingredients. At the end of 2022, 25/uni00A0 production sites worldwide were certified by the RSPO (2021: 26).\n\nAs part of our voluntary commitment, we also aim to procure the main derivatives 1 based on palm oil and palm kernel oil entirely from certified sustainable sources by 2025.\n\nWe source most of our palm-based raw materials from Malaysia and Indonesia. Smallholders account for around one-third of the total volumes produced there. We have worked together with The Est\u00e9e Lauder  Companies,  the  RSPO  and  the  non-governmental organization Solidaridad in Indonesia since 2019 to expand our supplier base  for  RSPO-certified  palm  oil  products  while strengthening smallholder structures and sustainable production methods at local level. The project in the province of Lampung supports around 1,000/uni00A0independent smallholders in improving their livelihoods and the sustainable production of palm oil and palm kernel oil. The focus is on efficient and sustainable farming practices and health and safety standards. The goal is for at least one-third of program participants to become certified according to the RSPO Smallholder Standard in three years.\n\nAlso important for BASF, albeit at a much smaller scale, is castor oil . We use castor oil to manufacture products such as plastics and ingredients for paints and coatings, as well as products for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. With the objective of establishing a certified sustainable supply chain for castor oil, we launched the Sustainable Castor Initiative - Pragati in 2016 together with the companies Arkema and Jayant Agro and with Solidaridad. The initiative aims to improve the economic situation of castor bean farmers in India and, at the same time, raise awareness of  sustainable farming  methods.  Over  80%  of  the  world's  castor  beans  are produced in India, mainly by smallholders. As part of Pragati, smallholder farmers receive training on topics such as cultivation methods, efficient water use, health and the safe use of crop protection products based on a specially developed sustainability code,  SuCCESS.  Since  the  project  was  initiated,  more  than 6,200/uni00A0 smallholders and over 19,000/uni00A0 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. Yields from this land were 22% higher than average amounts for the region published by the\n\nlocal government for the 2021/2022 harvest cycle. In addition to SuCCESS, the Sustainable Castor Association (SCA), which was launched in 2019 by the founders of the Pragati initiative, has also developed a sustainability code for the wider supply chain. This will allow  castor  beans  obtained  from  the  program  to  be  further processed  into  certified  castor  oil  and  derivatives  and  to  be introduced into the downstream supply chain. In 2022, we again sourced  certified  sustainable  castor  oil  from  the  program  and became the first chemical company in the world to successfully complete the certification process at our D\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen site in Germany. The site supplies customers with the first certified products based on certified sustainable castor oil.\n\nWe are also driving the market transformation toward certified, sustainably  sourced  oleochemicals  for  another  renewable  raw material: coconut oil . We use coconut oil to manufacture  ingredients for products such as detergents, cleaning agents and cosmetics. Following  the  successful  completion  of  a  cooperative  project between BASF, Cargill, Procter/uni00A0& Gamble and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) in 2019 to establish a certified supply chain for coconut oil, our production site in Cassina Rizzardi, Italy, became the first BASF site to successfully undergo certification under the Rainforest Alliance Mass Balance Coconut scheme in 2022. This makes BASF the world's first chemical company to offer certified sustainable ingredients for personal care products based on coconut oil.\n\nPlants also form the basis of many other products in our portfolio for cosmetics. These include our biopolymers, which we have been offering  under  the  Verdessence TM brand  since  2022,  and  our bioactives.  Through  sustainable  sourcing  practices,  we  aim  to preserve ecosystems and enable sustainable management for the people whose livelihoods depend on them. For example, we have already  been  combining  economic,  environmental  and  social aspects for several years in our holistic procurement initiatives for argan (Morocco), rambutan and galangal (both Vietnam).

That is why we want to increase the use of recycled feedstocks with our Circular Economy Program: From 2025 onward, we aim to process around 250,000/uni00A0metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials every year worldwide, replacing fossil raw materials.\n\nA focal point of our activities here is the chemical recycling of plastics. This technology complements mechanical recycling and can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is disposed of in landfills or thermally recovered. Chemical recycling breaks down plastics into their building blocks or converts them into basic chemicals. Different methods are used to achieve this.\n\nIn our ChemCycling TM project, our technology partners use the pyrolysis process to extract pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or used tires, which are not mechanically recycled as of yet. We feed the pyrolysis oil into the BASF Verbund as a substitute for fossil raw materials and manufacture new products from it using the mass balance principle (see page/uni00A0121). Our customers can process these mass balance products in the same way as conventional products. Our portfolio of Ccycled TM products now comprises more than 200/uni00A0 products,  which  our  customers  use  for  a  wide  range  of applications - from transport cases for temperature-sensitive drugs to  high-performance  plastics  for  the  automotive  industry  and functional textiles. In addition to our existing partnerships and to further expand our supply base for pyrolysis oil, we concluded a framework  agreement  with  Arcus  Greencycling  Technologies  in 2022.  The  company  is  currently  commissioning  a  process demonstration unit to produce pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste that  is  not  recycled  mechanically  on  a  commercial  scale.  The long-term goal of the agreement is to support capacity growth and enable offtake of up to 100,000/uni00A0metric tons of pyrolysis oil per year.\n\nIn a cooperative project with KraussMaffei, Rampf and Remondis launched in 2022, we want to develop a process to chemically\n\nrecycle  polyurethane  rigid  foam  waste  from  refrigerators  and freezers. Polyurethane is used as an insulation material in these electrical appliances. The project focuses on the depolymerization process  and  the  challenge  of  recovering  high-quality  recycled polyols despite high levels of impurities in the waste stream. Initial trials with regrind from discarded old appliances have already produced positive results.\n\nIn addition, BASF continues to drive forward the recycling of foam from  used  mattresses.  Using  a  process  developed  by  BASF, monomers can be recovered from the flexible polyurethane and used to produce new mattresses.\n\nWe have many years of experience and a high degree of  specialization in recycling precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. They are used in automotive catalysts as well as in process and  chemical  catalysts.  We  primarily  use  the  precious  metals recovered in this way as feedstocks to manufacture new products for  the  automotive,  chemical,  electronics  and  green  hydrogen industries. The carbon footprint for recycled precious metals is up to 90% lower than for primary metals from a mine. In 2022, we established a joint venture with Heraeus to enable a local supply of recycled precious metals for the Chinese market. BASF HERAEUS Metal Resource Co., Ltd. is based in Pinghu, China, where a new plant for recovering precious metals from spent automotive catalysts will also be built by 2023.\n\nWith the rapidly growing market for electric vehicles, there is also an increasing need for recycling lithium-ion batteries . As a leading producer of battery materials with local production capacities in the three main markets - Asia, Europe and North America - BASF has in-depth expertise in battery chemistry and process technology. We are utilizing these competencies to address battery recycling as an additional growth market in cooperation with partners along the value chain (see page/uni00A0 30). In this way, we want to ensure that valuable  metals  remain  in  the  production  cycle  for  as  long  as possible. This conserves resources and significantly reduces the carbon footprint of cathode active materials compared with the industry standard. A prototype plant for battery recycling will be",

In addition, a new plant for the production of black mass from  batteries on a commercial scale will be built in Schwarzheide by 2024. The investments aim to establish the full battery recycling value chain at BASF.\n\nFor more information on the circular economy, see page/uni00A043\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mineral raw materials\n\nWe procure a number of mineral raw materials, which we use to produce automotive and process catalysts or battery materials for electromobility, among other products. We are continually improving our products and processes to minimize the use of primary mineral raw materials. At the same time, we are driving forward the recycling of mineral raw materials, for example, by recovering and reusing valuable  metals  from  catalysts  and  lithium-ion  batteries  (see ' Recycled  feedstocks').\n\nSourcing mineral raw materials responsibly is important to BASF. We/uni00A0 have implemented the E.U. Conflict Minerals Regulation. This defines supply chain due diligence for tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores and gold (3TG) imported into the E.U. from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).\n\nIn addition, BASF is committed to responsible and sustainable global supply chains for other mineral raw materials. These include cobalt , a key component in the production of battery materials. We have organized our cobalt supply chain according to established sustainability guidelines such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals. Our goal is to not purchase cobalt from artisanal mines as long as responsible labor, social and environmental standards cannot be verified.\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The mass balance approach\n\nMany BASF value chains start in syngas plants or steam crackers, where fossil resources, mostly natural gas and naphtha, are converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide or important basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These are used to create thousands of products in the BASF Verbund.\n\nAlongside fossil resources, we use bio-based and recycled raw materials such as bio-naphtha, biomethane or pyrolysis oil as feedstocks in the Verbund. Alternatives like these are used in place of fossil feedstocks for our mass balance products. As fossil, bio-based and recycled feedstocks are processed simultaneously, the raw materials cannot be directly physically assigned to  resulting derivatives. However, with the help of monitoring and certification by independent third parties such as REDcert 2 or ISCC PLUS, it can  be  verified  that  an  adequate  amount  of  alternative  raw materials has been used for the amount of mass balance sales product. This ensures that fossil raw materials are saved with every sale of these certified products.\n\nMass balance products are identical in quality to conventionally produced  products  but  the  use  of  alternative  raw  materials contributes to sustainability, for example, through fewer CO2 emissions and lower demand for fossil raw materials. This method has  already been applied to over 1,000/uni00A0BASF products including engineering  plastics  such  as  polyamide,  superabsorbents, dispersions and intermediates.\n\nWe  share  our  expertise  in  numerous  stakeholder  platforms, including the European Commission's Circular Plastics Alliance, Together for Sustainability and nova-Institute's Renewable Carbon Initiative,  to  harmonize  and  standardize  different  attribution methods and certification schemes for mass balance products.\n\nFor more information on the mass balance approach, see basf.com/massbalance\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, we are a partner in a consortium led by Systemiq that has received funding of \u20ac8.2/uni00A0million from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action to develop a digital product passport for batteries. This aims to address the requirements of the E.U. Battery Regulation and both capture data that maps information about the origin of raw materials and form the basis for an efficient circular economy. Close cooperation with the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) will also ensure the global  compatibility of the digital battery passport. Co-founded by BASF in 2017, the GBA  has  over  120/uni00A0 members  and  promotes  dialog  between business, governments and civil society. It aims to establish a sustainable and responsible circular economy for batteries by 2030 and is developing the tools to steer this. One of these is the Greenhouse Gas Rulebook, which the GBA unveiled in 2022. As the first framework of its kind, it contains around 80/uni00A0specifications and rules for the globally harmonized - and therefore comparable - measurement of greenhouse gas emissions along the battery value chain.\n\nTogether with BMW, Mercedes Benz Group, Fairphone and Volkswagen, we have also been a member of the Responsible Lithium Partnership since 2021. It advocates for the responsible use of natural resources in Chile's Salar de Atacama, home to the world's largest lithium reserves and a significant portion of global  production. As  a  first  step,  GIZ  was  commissioned  to  organize  a  local\n\nmulti-stakeholder platform on the water-related opportunities and risks of lithium and copper mining and other economic activities such as agriculture and tourism. The goal of the platform is to reach a common understanding on the status quo and to develop a vision for the future of the Salar de Atacama watershed together with local interest groups. In addition, potential risks are to be minimized and opportunities promoted through the development and implementation of joint action plans. BASF also participated in a study organized by BMW together with experts from the University of Alaska and the University of Massachusetts to investigate hydrological conditions in the Salar de Atacama. The results of this study are now available and  will  be  incorporated  as  an  important  component  of  the Responsible Lithium Partnership's work.\n\nAnother mineral raw material that BASF processes is mica . As a base for effect pigments, it is mainly used in the production of  coatings and seed coatings. BASF is conscious of its social responsibility  with  regard  to  mica  sourcing  and  applies  high standards,  which,  among  other  things,  exclude  child  labor. Suppliers are asked to source mica in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. As a member of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), we advocate for the eradication of child labor and unacceptable  working conditions, specifically in India's mica supply chain. The  initiative   focuses  on   labor  standards,  strengthening  local com mu nities and legal frameworks. As RMI's most recent progress report shows, activities in the relevant regions of India have already led  to  improved  income  and  living  conditions.  These  include improved access to clean drinking water through the installation of pumps and filtration systems and improved access to health care through doctors' visits in villages and enrollment in public health insurance  plans.\n\nFor more information on the Cobalt for Development project,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsee basf.com/cobalt-initiative and cobalt4development.com\n\nFor more information on the Global Battery Alliance, see globalbattery.org For more information on the Responsible Mica Initiative, see responsible-mica-initiative.com",

We conduct regular audits every three to six years at all BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is a majority shareholder. We take a risk-based approach here. An audit database ensures that all sites and plants worldwide are regularly audited. We have defined our regulations for Responsible Care audits in a global Corporate Requirement. The Board of Executive Directors is regularly informed about the results of the audits.\n\nNewly acquired sites and companies are generally audited for the first time after the integration phase is complete, generally within one to two years depending on complexity and size.\n\nDuring our audits, we create a safety and environmental profile that shows if we are properly addressing the hazard potential. If this is not the case, we agree on corrective measures to be implemented within a certain time frame depending on the identified hazard potential. We monitor this in follow-up audits, among other things.\n\nIn the BASF/uni00A0 Group in 2022, 115 environmental and safety audits were conducted at 73 sites (2021: 143/uni00A0audits at 71/uni00A0sites). The sites were audited based on their individual risk profile. Auditing of the sites acquired from Solvay started as planned in 2022 but will need to continue in 2023 due to local coronavirus restrictions. In addition, 16 sites were audited on occupational medicine and health protection (2021: 13). Online audits were conducted for four of these sites. These  remote  audits  focused  on  documented  processes  and management  systems.\n\nFor more information on occupational and process safety and health protection, see page/uni00A0125 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External certification\n\nWe pursue a decentralized certification approach for our  business units and Group companies.

The BASF health checks form the foundation of our global health promotion program and are offered to employees at regular intervals. We also raise employee awareness of health topics with offerings tailored to specific target groups. One example of this is the annual Global Health Campaign, which in 2022 was dedicated to the motto 'Good morning - regeneration through sleep.' The program included a wide range of virtual and in-person seminars and interactive events on the different factors that influence restful sleep. Over 440 sites took part, offering events such as workshops, courses, lectures and exercises.\n\nWe measure our performance in health protection using the Health  Performance  Index  (HPI).  This  has  five  components: recognized occupational diseases, medical emergency drills, first aid, preventive medicine and health promotion. Each component contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score, meaning that the highest possible score is 1.0. We aim to reach a value of more than 0.9 every year. With an HPI of 0.96, we once again reached this in 2022 (2021: 0.96).\n\nIn  2022,  38  work-related  illnesses  among  BASF  employees worldwide  were documented as recognized occupational diseases (2021:  36).  The  main  recognized  occupational  diseases  are occupational asthma, hearing loss, skin diseases, musculoskeletal disorders and cancer.\n\nWe successfully continued our proven activities to combat the coronavirus pandemic in 2022, adapted in each case to local infection rates and the on-site risk. Measures included vaccination services, for example with our own vaccination center at our largest site in Ludwigshafen, Germany.\n\nAnother focus in 2022 was on influenza prevention. BASF employees could be vaccinated against the seasonal flu at many sites around the world. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, around 6,200 employees participated in the influenza vaccination campaign.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on occupational medicine, health campaigns and the HPI, see basf.com/health\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digitalization in production\n\nNumerous digital solutions and applications are used in BASF's production plants to further increase safety, security, availability and  efficiency.  One  example  is  creating  virtual  replicas  of production facilities using 3D modeling (digital twinning). This enables us to carry out maintenance and servicing work more efficiently and safely, for example, or further improve employee training. More than 30/uni00A03D/uni00A0models are in continuous use at BASF around the world, covering all phases of a plant's life cycle.\n\nDigital tools are also used to access large amounts of data from different sources, intelligently link them together and prepare them for further analysis. This data is analyzed using methods like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, for  example, to detect and rectify anomalies relating to the plant at an early stage (predictive maintenance). This  reduces unplanned repairs and downtime and optimizes the  coordination of maintenance and production  processes.  Data  can  also  be  evaluated  using  AI methods to improve the production process to reduce energy use or emissions.",

Should  an  emergency  nevertheless  arise, we/uni00A0 have established structures and processes that enable effective crisis management.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nWe want to be as prepared as possible for crisis situations at global, regional and local level - from process safety incidents and goods spillages to pandemics and cyber attacks - through extensive emergency preparedness and emergency response regulations and measures. That is why our emergency and crisis management focuses  on  the  protection  of  our  employees,  contractors  and neighbors, the safety of our plants and sites, and the protection of our  intellectual  property.  To  ensure  rapid  and  effective  crisis management,  we  have  defined  appropriate  structures  and processes and laid them down in binding Group-wide guidelines. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and  complying  with  these  internal  guidelines  and  the  legal requirements. The Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this.\n\nUnusual incidents are recorded and reported centrally in accordance with a standard Group-wide procedure (e-Rapid Incident Report). This enables us to identify risks at an early stage and, if necessary, initiate appropriate relief and communication measures. All incidents are carefully followed up on to identify potential for improvement, which is integrated into existing concepts as needed.\n\n## Emergency response\n\nIncidents are initially handled by the local crisis organization or local emergency response team. We have implemented precautionary organizational measures with clearly defined responsibilities and procedures at all sites for this purpose. The responsible persons receive regular training. This includes safety and emergency drills, which vary in scope and the number of people involved. Depending on the situation, we also involve business partners and our sites' communities, such as local authorities or neighboring companies, both in drills and in the event of an emergency. Additional teams may be called in for emergencies, depending on the extent of the damage and how it develops.\n\nFor example, the Global Crisis Management Support Team (GCMS), led by a member of the Board of Executive Directors, was most recently activated in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. It provides  the  strategic  direction  for  crisis  management  and  is supported by issue-specific and specialist working groups.\n\nWe are actively involved in external networks, which quickly provide information and assistance in emergencies. These include the International Chemical and Environmental (ICE) initiative and the German Transport Accident Information and Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role. In 2022, we provided assistance to public emergency response agencies and other companies in 131 cases (2021: 138). This included  information on chemicals and their proper disposal, on-site operational support for transportation  accidents  involving  hazardous  goods,  or information on human biomonitoring. We apply the experience we have gathered to improve our own processes and set up similar systems in other countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency\\_response\n\n## Corporate and cyber security\n\nWe protect our employees, sites, plants and company know-how against  third-party  interference.  Cyber  security  and  information security plays an increasingly important role here. BASF applies the 'security by design' principle to critically review and optimize IT applications from a cybersecurity perspective as early as the design phase. We are continually improving our ability to prevent, detect and react to security incidents with various measures and training programs. Our global cyber security team is tasked with protecting our IT systems and the data and business processes they handle. We cooperate with experts and partners in a global network to ensure that we can protect ourselves against cyber attacks as far as possible. Our IT security management system is certified according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017. It also supports, in particular, our critical infrastructures in meeting additional compliance  requirements such as DIN/uni00A0 EN ISO/IEC 27019:2020, IT security catalog and corresponding industry-specific standards (B3S).\n\nAround the world, we work to sensitize our employees about protecting information and know-how. In 2022, we continued to raise employees' risk awareness with mandatory, regular online training for all employees and complementary offerings such as seminars, case studies and interactive training. These increasingly addressed aspects of working practices that have changed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, such as cybersecurity when working from home.\n\nOur global network of information protection officers comprises around 600 employees. They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and hold events and seminars on secure behaviors. Around 58,000 employees had been trained on the basics of cyber security and information protection in 2022. Our standardized Group-wide recommendations for the protection of information and knowledge were expanded in 2022 and updated in line with current developments.",

We continuously work to ensure that our products pose no risk to people or the environment when they are used responsibly and in the manner intended.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nWe are committed to continuously minimizing the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and to the ongoing optimization of our products. This commitment to product safety  is  enshrined  in  our  Responsible  Care \u00ae charter  and  the initiatives  of  the  International  Council  of  Chemical  Associations (ICCA). Our products should not pose any risk to humans or the environment when used responsibly and in the manner intended. We aim to comply with all relevant national and international laws and regulations.\n\nOur global requirements define rules, processes and responsibilities, for example, to ensure uniformly high product safety standards worldwide. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and complying with internal guidelines and legal requirements. The Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this. BASF's global network of experts shares information, insights and best practices around product safety on an ongoing basis.\n\nBefore our products are launched on the market, they undergo various tests and assessments - depending on legal requirements and their application profile. Our aim here is to identify potential hazard characteristics as well as health and environmental risks at an early stage. Based on these results, we derive precautionary and\n\nprotective  measures  and  develop  recommendations  for  safe handling - from production to application and disposal.\n\nWe maintain and evaluate environmental, health and safety data for all of our substances and products in a global database . This information is continuously updated. The database forms the basis for communicating this information in our safety data sheets, which we make available to our customers in around 40/uni00A0languages. These include information on the physical/chemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of products, potential hazards, first aid measures, measures to be taken in the case of accidental release, and disposal. Our global emergency hotline network enables us to provide information around the clock. To ensure that people who buy, sell, use, transport or dispose of our products can quickly find out about our products and the risks associated with them, we use the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) to classify and label our products around the world, provided this is legally permissible in the country concerned. We take into account any national or regional modifications  within  the  GHS  framework,  such  as  the  E.U.'s regula tion on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation).\n\nIf necessary, we advise our customers on product safety. We set guidelines on the safe transport of dangerous goods for our logistics service providers worldwide (see page 134). We also train our employees worldwide on the proper handling and use of selected products with particular hazard potential.\n\nIn  associations  and  together  with  other  manufacturers,  BASF supports the establishment of voluntary global commitments to prevent the misuse of chemicals. We are also involved at national and international level in various initiatives to further develop risk assessments, such as that of the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC).\n\n## Global chemicals regulations\n\nMost of the products we manufacture are subject to statutory chemicals regulations. We are bound by the relevant regional and national chemicals regulations, which continue to grow in number worldwide. Examples include REACH in the E.U., UK REACH in the United Kingdom, KKDIK in Turkey, K-REACH in South Korea and TSCA in the United States. BASF Group companies work closely together with a global network of experts to ensure that BASF complies with the applicable regulations.\n\nIn Europe, the European Commission has developed a roadmap that will bring about far-reaching changes to the regulation of chemicals in Europe in the coming years: the European Green Deal and, as a part of this, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS). BASF supports the objectives of the Green Deal in principle but sees a need for adjustment, greater clarity and predictability, particularly  in  regulatory  matters,  to  strike  a  balance  between achieving the ambitions of the CSS and safeguarding the long-term competitiveness  and  future  viability  of  the  European  chemical industry.  As  part  of  the  ongoing  clarification  process,  we  are therefore seeking dialog with all relevant stakeholders and are advocating for a science-based and innovation-driven development of the regulatory framework.\n\n## Animal welfare in environmental and toxicological testing\n\nBefore launching products on the market, we subject them to a variety of tests, including environmental and toxicological tests using state-of-the-art knowledge and technology.  If these tests include animal studies, this is generally required by law and necessary to reliably evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products. If we employ animal studies, we adhere to the specifications laid down by the German Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care - the highest standard for laboratory animals in the world. We develop and are continuously optimizing alternative methods to experimentally assess the safety and tolerance of our products",

In addition, we are involved in networks such as the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing to further develop alternative methods across sectors.\n\nOur aim is to replace, reduce or refine animal studies to minimize the impact on them. For example, we use an OECD-certified alternative testing  strategy  developed  jointly  with  Givaudan  for  animal-free testing of allergic skin reactions. We also use other alternative methods. In 2022, BASF/uni00A0SE's Experimental Toxicology and Ecology became the first institute in the world to be certified for Good In Vitro Method Practices (GIVIMP). GIVIMP is a standard published by the/uni00A0 OECD. It increases the quality of data generated by in vitro test  methods and confidence in newly developed non-animal test methods.\n\n## Management of nano- and biotechnology\n\nNanotechnology and biotechnology offer solutions for key societal challenges - such as environmental and climate protection and health and nutrition. For example, nanomaterials can improve battery  performance and biocatalytic methods can improve process resource efficiency. We want to harness the potential of both technologies. Using them safely and responsibly is our top priority. Safe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology Code of Conduct, for instance. Two European Union-sponsored projects on assessing nanosafety - GRACIOUS and PATROLS were completed with BASF's assistance. The results were documented and communicated in 2022 in numerous publications with BASF's involvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the GRACIOUS project, see h2020gracious.eu\n\nFor more information on the PATROLS project, see patrols-h2020.eu",

Our products and technologies help them master this complex task.\n\nAs global demand for agricultural products and solutions grows, so does the pressure on farmers. They need to produce more and are expected to simultaneously reduce their environmental footprint. With our integrated offer, we help farmers find the right balance between economic, environmental and societal demands. High performance seeds from BASF offer benefits such as a higher yield, better quality and greater resilience against environmental influences like drought. Our innovative crop protection products reduce crop losses caused by insect pests, weeds and fungal diseases. Our digital solutions enable, among other things, better soil management and more targeted use of fertilizers and crop protection  products by taking important parameters such as plant health, weed density or weather data directly into account during application.\n\nIn 2022, we invested \u20ac944 million in research and development in the Agricultural Solutions segment, which represents 9% of segment sales.  Our well-filled innovation pipeline has a peak sales potential  of  more  than  \u20ac7.5/uni00A0 billion  for  products  launched  by 2032.   The main  focus here is sustainability, with four key areas: climate- smart  farming, sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart stewardship (see box on page 34).\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe are continuously improving our farming solutions. Alongside aspects such as efficacy and productivity, this also includes safe application by our customers and impact on the environment.\n\nCrop protection products and seeds are highly regulated at national and international level, which brings with it strict requirements for registering and re-registering active ingredients and crop systems. Regulatory approval is only granted when extensive documentation can be provided showing that our products are safe for people, animals and the environment when used in the manner intended.\n\nAs a member of the CropLife International industry association, we are committed to complying with the standards on the research, registration and distribution of crop protection products set out in the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In our use of biotechnology, we are guided by the code of conduct set out by EuropaBio, the European biotechnology association, and adhere to the relevant standards and legal regulations governing production and marketing.",

        "page_content": "Potential risks of our products are assessed and minimized throughout the research, development and registration process, and on an ongoing basis following market registration. We regularly conduct scientific  studies  and  tests,  including  on  modes  of  action, (eco) toxicological properties and possible residues. This ensures that,  as  far  as  possible,  our  registration  dossiers  address  all questions on potential environmental and health effects.\n\nWe adapt our portfolio to the specific requirements of regional markets as customer requirements, crops, soils, climate conditions, plant  diseases  and  farming  practices  vary  around  the  world. Consequently, product approvals differ from country to country. Distribution  generally  requires  registration  and  approval  of  our products in accordance with the respective national regulations.\n\n## Crop protection\n\nBASF adheres to the International Code of Conduct issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the distribution of crop protection products. These are only marketed once they have been approved by the relevant authorities. We no longer sell WHO Class 1A or 1B products (high acute oral and dermal toxicity), even if formal approvals exist. Depending on availability, we offer our customers alternatives.\n\nAll of BASF's crop protection products can be used safely under local farming conditions if the information and directions on the label are followed. If they have any questions, complaints or issues, our customers can contact us through various channels, for example, by calling the telephone number printed on all product labels, using the contact forms on our websites or by approaching our sales employees directly. We record all product incidents relating to health or the environment that come to our attention in a global data base. If necessary, we take appropriate measures on the basis of this infor mation to minimize preventable incidents. These include updating the instructions for use on product labels. We  communicate\n\nthese changes and general recommendations on the safe use of our/uni00A0 products through channels such as our Farmer Field School initiatives in Asia and in training programs such as the On Target Application Academy in the United States.\n\nOne of the ways we meet our commitment to product  stewardship is by offering a wide range of courses and training on the safe storage, handling, use and disposal of our products. This ranges from on-site events to handouts and digital offerings and is aimed at farmers, retailers, consultants and other users. In India, for example, BASF  launched  the  Suraksha  Hamesha  program.  Suraksha Hamesha means 'safety all the time.' The program creates a platform for educating farmers and other users of crop protection products about the nine steps of responsible use of crop protection products and personal protection. Through Suraksha Hamesha, BASF has trained over 189,000/uni00A0 agricultural workers and around 39,000/uni00A0 users  across  India  since  2016.  BASF  also  involves government agencies and the central government's farm extension teams in these meetings to support and promote farm safety. In addition, digital initiatives reached around 17/uni00A0million farmers in India and informed them about safety in agriculture.\n\nBASF also promotes new application technologies: In China, for example, more than 1,000/uni00A0drone pilots were trained in the safe use of crop protection products as part of the Fly with BASF program in 2022.\n\nWe also work closely together with associations such as CropLife International and CropLife Europe to promote the safe and proper use  of  crop  protection  products.  For  example,  we  support stewardship initiatives of both associations and various programs on the proper  disposal  and  recycling  of  product  containers. Technological innovations developed together with industry partners also help to make using crop protection products easier and safer. Examples  include  the  closed  transfer  systems  easyconnect  in Europe and the Wisdom system in South America.\n\n## Seeds\n\nOur biotechnology activities and our research and development capabilities  comprise  advanced  breeding  techniques,  analytics, technology platforms and trait validation. To offer tailor-made, more sustainable crop solutions, our gene identification work focuses on those plant characteristics that enable higher yield and better  quality, disease resistance and tolerance of environmental factors such as drought. We apply state-of-the-art scientific methods here such as genetic engineering and selective genome editing.\n\nBASF is a member of Excellence Through Stewardship (ETS), a global industry initiative for seeds. This initiative promotes the adoption of quality management systems for seeds and product stewardship programs covering the entire life cycle. It also has independent auditors verify compliance with its guidelines. In 2022, BASF successfully passed ETS audits on laboratory operations, contained biotech facilities, general stewardship, incident response management and product handling at the Research Triangle Park and Pikevill sites in the United States, Trindade and Primavera do Leste in Brazil, and Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia.\n\n- For more information on our Agricultural Solutions segment, see page/uni00A088 onward\n\nFor more information on biodiversity, see page 147 onward\n\nFor more information on risks from litigation and claims, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 268",

That is why we depend on global  standards,  an  effective  organization,  training  and  reliable logistics partners. Our goal is to minimize risks along the entire transportation chain.\n\nAll BASF products intended for transport must be clearly identifiable, classified, securely packaged and labeled. The transportation of dangerous goods is subject to mandatory national and international dangerous goods regulations as well as our global guidelines. Our sites  and  Group  companies  are  responsible  for  implementing\n\ntransportation  safety  regulations  and  guidelines.  Compliance  is regularly monitored by the Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center using globally standardized transportation safety reviews. External logistics partners are evaluated based on risk either through assessments or on-site audits.\n\nOur global network of BASF experts trains the responsible leaders and their employees on transporting dangerous goods. This  network also ensures that information, insights and best practices are shared on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Preventive safety measures\n\nNational and international dangerous goods regulations are based on an assessment of transportation risks and define rules and measures for safely transporting dangerous goods. We use various tools  to  minimize  transportation  risks.  For  example,  for  every dangerous good to be transported, we check in each case whether the packaging has been approved for that product and is suitable for the type of transport. We conduct digital dangerous goods checks before shipping orders are released. In addition, vehicles are subjected to a thorough dangerous goods check prior to loading and rejected if there are any issues.\n\nAbove and beyond this, we use our global requirement to  specifically assess  the  safety  and  environmental  risks  of  transporting  and handling raw materials and sales products with high hazard  potential. This is based on the Guidance on Safety Risk Assessment for Chemical Transport Operations published by the European  Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\nWe  stipulate  worldwide  requirements  for  our  logistics  service providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. Our experts  use  our  own  tools  as  well  as  internationally  approved schemes for evaluation and monitoring. These include the ship\n\n- 1 Data is collected based on the International Council of Chemical Association's (ICCA) guidance for reporting performance and includes road, rail and container shipping incidents.\n- 2 Hazardous goods are classified in accordance with national and international hazardous goods regulations.\n\ninspection reports issued by the Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).\n\n## Transportation incidents\n\nTo evaluate transportation safety, we systematically record transportation incidents according to defined criteria. We use the number of transportation  incidents 1 as  a  reporting  indicator.  In  2022,  we recorded 25 transportation incidents worldwide (2021: 21).\n\nA particular focus is incidents involving goods spillages that could lead to significant environmental impacts. These include dangerous goods leaks in excess of 200 kilograms on public traffic routes, provided  transport  was  arranged  by  BASF.  We  recorded  one incident  in  2022  with  spillage  of  more  than  200/uni00A0 kilograms  of dangerous  goods 2 (2021:/uni00A03). This incident did not have a significant impact on the environment (2021: 0).\n\nFor more information on transportation safety, see basf.com/distribution\\_safety\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are pursuing ambitious climate  protection targets (see 'Global targets'), which we aim to achieve with comprehensive carbon management. This includes five levers to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and demand for fossil fuel :\n\n- -Grey-to-green: We are increasingly meeting our electricity needs from renewable sources (see 'Energy supply').\n\n## Schematic overview: Development of the BASF Group's greenhouse gas emissions (Scope/uni00A01 and 2) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Power-to-steam: In  the  future,  we  will  increasingly  rely  on electrical steam  generation and in this way, also tap previously unused waste heat potential (see 'Energy supply').\n- -New technologies: We are developing completely new carbonfree and low-carbon processes and technologies for  climate-smart chemistry (see box on page 141).\n- -Bio-based  feedstocks: We  are  increasingly  replacing  fossil resources with alternative raw materials (see 'Raw Materials').\n- -Continuous opex: Our operational excellence activities con tinually improve the energy and process efficiency of our plants (see 'Energy efficiency').\n\nWe  only  consider  external  offsetting  measures  as  a  temporary stop-gap if our activities do not make the desired contribution to reducing emissions.\n\n- 1 Scope/uni00A01 and Scope/uni00A02 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties, including offsetting). The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e).\n\nBy 2030, we plan to invest up to \u20ac4 billion to achieve our climate protection targets.\n\nWe have established organizational structures to implement our climate protection targets and carbon management activities with even  greater  focus  and  speed:  The  Environmental  Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center develops Group-wide guidelines and requirements for collecting emissions and energy data and for energy management. It conducts regular audits to monitor the implementation of and compliance with  internal guidelines and legal requirements by our sites and Group  companies. The Corporate Strategy & Sustainability unit develops and tracks the BASF/uni00A0 Group's climate targets and strategic levers for achieving them  based  on  our  corporate  carbon  footprint.  The  Net  Zero Accelerator unit, which was established in early 2022, focuses on the accelerated implementation of existing and new cross-divisional projects to reduce emissions. The emphasis is on carbon-free and low-carbon production technologies (see page/uni00A0 141), the circular economy  (see  page  43)  and  renewable  energies  (see  'Energy",

This integrates climate protection-relevant aspects into strategic decision-making processes and core business activities (see page 47). In parallel, our operating divisions are working on divisional- specific projects to reduce emissions. They are supported here by the global service units.\n\nWe report on greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as well as the sector-specific standard for the chemical industry. We consistently align our actions with our climate protection targets, based on a comprehensive analysis of our emissions. Group-wide CO2 emissions are anchored in the BASF  Group's  steering  and  compensation  systems  as  a  most important nonfinancial key performance indicator, giving them even more weight. Steering also includes assessing investments and acquisitions with regard to their impact on our climate protection targets.\n\nWe are gradually integrating our suppliers into the management of greenhouse gas emissions along the value chain. To this end, we launched the Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021 (see 'Product Carbon Footprints').\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy and resource efficiency. To increase transparency for our customers and target our CO2 reduction measures to those areas where they bring the greatest added value, we continuously determine the Product Carbon Footprint for around 45,000 sales products (see 'Product Carbon Footprints').\n\nwhich TCFD-relevant information can be found (see page 19). We also participate in the program established by the international nonprofit organization CDP for reporting on data relevant to climate protection and have done so since 2004. BASF again achieved a score of A- in CDP's 2022 climate change questionnaire,  maintaining its  Leadership  status.  Companies  on  the  Leadership  level  are distinguished by factors such as the completeness and  transparency of their reporting. They also pursue comprehensive approaches in managing  the  opportunities  and  risks  associated  with  climate change as well as strategies to achieve company-wide emission reduction goals.\n\nAll parts of society must work together to effectively protect the climate. This is why we support various national and international initiatives and are involved in partnerships. For example, in 2022 we provided funding to help the Science Based Targets (SBTi) initiative launch a project to derive science-based climate protection targets for the chemical sector, in which we are also involved as a member of an advisory group. As part of Together for Sustainability, in 2022/uni00A0 we were involved in the creation of a uniform guideline for calculating the carbon footprint of products in the chemical industry (see  'Product Carbon Footprints').\n\n- For more information on climate protection and carbon management,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsee basf.com/climate\\_protection\n\nFor more information on the CDP climate change questionnaire, see basf.com/en/cdp\n\nWe continuously analyze potential risks to our business operations arising in connection with the topics of energy and climate  protection and derive appropriate measures. We support the  recommendations of  the Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD). Since the 2019 reporting year, BASF's annual report has included an overview showing the sections and subsections in\n\n## Global targets\n\nCompared with the 2018 baseline, we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases by 25% by 2030. 1 This means that we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 21.9 million metric tons to 16.4 million metric tons - despite our growth plans and the construction of a new Verbund site in southern China. This corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990. Our long-term goal is net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 1\n\n## 2030 and 2050 targets\n\n## -25%\n\nReduction in our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2018 (Scope 1 and 2) a\n\n## Net zero\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Scope 1 and 2) a\n\na  BASF operations excluding sale of energy to third parties, including offsetting\n\nThe BASF Group's emissions reported under these targets in 2022 amounted to 18.4 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2021: 20.2/uni00A0million metric tons). The increase in natural gas prices in Europe due  to  the  war  in  Ukraine,  weaker  demand  due  to  a  slowing economy over the course of the year and several lockdowns in China led to a significant reduction in production volumes and, as a result, emissions in 2022. This particularly affected the emissionsintensive ammonia value chain. The share of electricity from renewable sources was kept roughly constant compared with the previous year and, together with measures to increase energy and process efficiency, made a relevant contribution to reducing emissions.\n\nFor more information on climate protection, see page 27\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA projection of greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 can be found in the forecast from page 154 onward",

Total  energy  consumption includes fuel demand in our own central power and steam  generation plants, primary energy requirements in our process plants, and net power and steam imports.\n\nTo generate our own steam and power , we mainly use natural gas (77.4%) and substitute fuels (17.5%). The latter are residues from chemical production plants that cannot be reused in the BASF Verbund. In 2022, we covered more than 54% of our electricity demand  with our own gas and steam turbines in highly efficient combined  heat  and  power  plants.  Combined  heat  and  power generation reduces the carbon footprint of our energy production and  simultaneously  ensures  that  fuels  are  used  as  efficiently as/uni00A0 possible: For instance, compared with separate methods of generating steam and electricity, we saved 12.0/uni00A0 million MWh of fossil fuels and avoided 2.4/uni00A0million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2022. To achieve the highest possible energy yield with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions, we continuously invest in our combined heat and power plants. In 2022, internally generated power  in  the  BASF  Group  had  a  carbon  footprint  of  around 0.25/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 per MWh of electricity and was below the national grid factor at most BASF sites.\n\nThe Verbund system is also key to carbon-optimized energy supply at our sites. It helps us realize synergies and manage value chains in a resource-efficient way. For example, waste heat from one plant's production process is used as energy in other plants. The Verbund saved us around 19.0/uni00A0 million MWh in 2022, which translates to 3.8/uni00A0million metric tons less CO2 released into the environment. With combined power and steam generation as well as our continuously optimized Energy Verbund, we were thus able to avoid a total of 6.2/uni00A0million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2022. That is why we will continue to invest in the creation and optimization of Verbund structures and drive forward the consolidation of production at highly efficient sites.\n\n## Electricity supply a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steam supply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Conversion factor: 0.75 MWh per metric ton of steam\n\nA core component in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is the gradual conversion of our energy supply from fossil to renewable sources as part of our carbon management. This mainly affects our electricity supply ( grey-to-green lever ). In 2022, electricity from renewable sources as a share of total electricity consumption could be kept constant at 16% (2021: 16%). Our electricity  requirements will increase significantly in the coming years due to the planned electrification of our steam generation and the gradual switch from natural gas-based to electricity-based, low-carbon production processes, for example in our steam crackers (see page/uni00A0141). We aim to source more than 60% of our power needs from renewable sources by 2030. Based on our growth forecast, this is roughly equivalent to our total power demand in 2021.\n\nIn the transformation of our power supply, we are pursuing a make/uni00A0 &  buy  approach .  Firstly,  BASF  is  investing  in  its  own\n\n## Fossil fuels and residual fuels used in the BASF Group's central power and steam generation plants\n\n## Natural gas\n\n26.1 million MWh\n\n77.4%\n\nHeating oil\n\n0.8 million MWh\n\n2.4%\n\nCoal\n\n0.9 million MWh\n\n2.7%\n\nSubstitute fuels\n\n5.9 million MWh\n\n17.5%\n\n33.7 million MWh\n\nTotal:\n\nrenewable power assets, particularly offshore wind farms. Secondly, BASF will purchase green power on the market through long-term supply agreements with plant operators, green power agreements or  renewable energy certificates, depending on the region and market regulations. A key purchasing criterion is the 'additionality' of the electricity purchased. This means that electricity is primarily sourced from new renewable energy facilities.\n\nIn 2022, we successfully drove forward the transformation of our power supply. Work on the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, a joint project with Vattenfall and Allianz, is proceeding according to plan. The offshore wind farm should be fully operational in 2023. With 140 turbines and a capacity of 1.5/uni00A0gigawatts, Hollandse Kust Zuid will then be one of the largest subsidy-free offshore wind farms in the world. Our new solar power plant at the Schwarzheide site in/uni00A0 Germany went online at the end of August 2022. We operate it",

Most of the electricity generated (expected electricity production: 25/uni00A0GWh per year) will be used to supply the Schwarzheide site and cover around 10% of the site's current annual electricity demand on average.\n\nIn addition to these cooperative ventures, in 2022 we concluded further long-term supply agreements for green power. In North America, for example, we have secured around 250/uni00A0 megawatts of wind and solar generation capacity through virtual power purchase agreements with Dawn Solar and EDF Energy Services. BASF has also signed a 12-year supply agreement with X-ELIO to supply 48/uni00A0megawatts of solar power to the Freeport site in Texas. In China, we initiated further long-term supply agreements for green power with  the  State  Power  Investment  Corporation  and  Brookfield, including for our new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, which is currently under  construction.  Our  aim  is  to  supply  the  site  entirely  with electricity from renewable sources from the start-up phase of the large-scale plants in 2025 - much earlier than originally planned.\n\nIn some regions, we have also acquired green power certificates. The aim is to gradually replace these temporary measures with our own power assets or long-term supply agreements.\n\nIn total, over 108 sites worldwide were already partially or fully powered by renewable energy at the end of 2022 (2021: 88). The carbon  footprint  of  purchased  electricity  in  2022  was  around\n\n- 1 Sales product volumes include sales between BASF/uni00A0Group companies; merchandise is not taken into account.\n- 2 Relevant sites are selected based on the amount of primary energy used and local energy prices.\n\n0.24/uni00A0 metric tons of CO2/MWh (market-based approach), slightly above the previous year's level (0.21/uni00A0metric tons CO2/MWh).\n\nThe second lever for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our energy supply starts with the production of steam ( power-to-steam lever ). In the future, new technologies should make a significant contribution to reducing CO2, for example by recovering energy from the waste heat of our production and infrastructure facilities. To e xplore the potential of various technologies, in 2022, for example, we initiated a joint feasibility study with MAN Energy Solutions on the construction of an industrial-scale heat pump at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. This could generate up to 150/uni00A0metric tons of steam per hour from previously unused wastewater heat, reducing the site's CO2 emissions by up to 390,000/uni00A0metric tons per year.\n\n## Energy efficiency and specific greenhouse gas emissions\n\nEnergy  use  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  closely  linked to/uni00A0  capacity utilization at our plants as well as our product port folio. Specific greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 amounted to 0.577/uni00A0 metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalents  per  metric  ton  of  sales product, 1 an increase of 2.3% compared with the previous year (2021: 0.564/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product). This was mainly due to lower and less uniform capacity utilization at our plants compared with the previous year, which led\n\nto reduced plant efficiency. By contrast, the use of renewable  energy had a positive impact on specific greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSince 1990, we have been able to lower our overall greenhouse gas/uni00A0 emissions from BASF operations by 54.1% and even reduce specific emissions (per metric ton of sales product) by 74.8 %.\n\nAs part of our carbon management, we aim to make our plants and processes even more efficient and resource saving ( continuous opex lever ). Certified energy management systems according to DIN/uni00A0EN/uni00A0ISO 50001 at all relevant production sites 2 play a  particularly important role here. These help us to identify and implement further potential for improvement in energy efficiency. This not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and saves valuable energy resources but also increases our competitiveness. In 2022, 76 production sites worldwide had certified energy management systems, representing 87.7% of our primary energy demand.\n\n## Certified energy management systems (ISO/uni00A050001) at BASF Group sites worldwide, in terms of primary energy demand\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA global working group provides ongoing support to the sites and Group companies in implementing and maintaining certified energy management systems.

        "page_content": "In 2022, we implemented more than 500 measures to reduce energy and resource consumption and increase our  competitiveness. At the Chongqing site in China, for example, modifications to the wastewater  treatment  process  reduced  heat  demand  and  the resulting emissions by more than 2,500/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 per year. At a plant at the Kuantan site in Malaysia, an optimized control system allowed existing flash steam to be fully utilized, reducing additional steam demand. This enables an emissions reduction of over 1,500/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 per year. At the Ludwigshafen site in G ermany, the innovative design of a new residue incineration line enables the more efficient use of combustion heat to produce steam. This avoids more than 5,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions every year.\n\nOur employees' ideas are an important source of optimization. Award-winning suggestions for improvements implemented in 2022 will enable us to save around 9,000/uni00A0metric tons of CO2 per year at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany alone.\n\n## Corporate carbon footprint\n\nBASF has published a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint every year since 2008. This reports on all emissions along the value chain - from raw materials extraction to production and disposal. We are continually working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both in our own production and, together with our partners, along the value chain (see 'Strategy and governance').\n\nIn 2022, our greenhouse gas emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (market- based approach, including sales of energy to third parties) were  19.185  million  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalents  (2021: 21.131/uni00A0 million metric tons). Of this amount, 86% were Scope 1 emissions (2021: 88%) and 14% were Scope 2 emissions (2021: 12%).  Carbon  dioxide  was  by  far  the  largest  component  and accounted for 98% of emissions (2021: 98%).\n\nScope  3  greenhouse  gas  emissions arising  upstream  and downstream of our operations in the value chain are calculated in accordance with the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard published by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the WBCSD Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG  Emissions  in  the  Chemical  Sector  Value  Chain  (WBCSD Chemicals). Both standards involve the use of values from general databases. For 2022, we calculated Scope 3 emissions of around 92 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2021: 101 million metric tons). There was a significant reduction in total emissions along the BASF value chain in 2022 due to lower production volumes.\n\nOur supply chain made the largest contribution to Scope 3 in 2022, with 54 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2021: 59/uni00A0 million metric tons). To calculate these upstream greenhouse gas  emissions, we  used  information  on  the  carbon  footprint  of  raw  materials, primarily from external databases. We intend to gradually replace this with data from our Supplier CO2 Management Program. In 2022,  we  were  involved  in  the  creation  of  new  Together  for Sustainability (TfS) recommendations for determining supply chain emissions  to  improve  reporting  transparency  and  consistency across the industry (see page 141).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol; Scope/uni00A01, 2 and 3; reported categories within Scope/uni00A03 are shown in parentheses.

This figure is based on assumptions about the disposal of products at the end of the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our emissions reporting, see basf.com/corporate\\_carbon\\_footprint\n\nFor more information on Product Carbon Footprints, see basf.com/en/pcf\n\n## Product Carbon Footprints\n\nIn 2020, we developed a digital solution to make our productspecific  greenhouse  gas  emissions  more  transparent  and  have since determined the carbon footprints of around 45,000 sales products.  These  Product  Carbon  Footprints  (PCFs)  include  all greenhouse gas emissions - from raw materials extraction to the finished product leaving the factory gates ('cradle-to-gate'). PCFs provide us with important information for assessing the climate impact of our products and guidance for implementing mitigation\n\nmeasures so that our customers can benefit from reduced carbon emissions in the value chain.\n\nIn 2022, we further expanded our portfolio of products with a certified reduced carbon footprint, including engineering plastics and  polyurethanes,  intermediates  and  aroma  ingredients.  We already offer some of our products, such as the intermediates neopentyl  glycol  (see  page  72)  and  propionic  acid,  and  the isocyanate MDI, with a net zero carbon footprint. These lower PCFs are mostly made possible by the substitution of fossil raw materials. For  instance,  we  use  climate-neutral  electricity  from  renewable sources instead of electricity from fossil fuels to produce low-PCF and zero-PCF products . We also use - in whole or in part - renewable, waste-based or recycled raw materials such as palm oil, castor oil, biomethane or pyrolysis oil from plastic waste. These alternative resources have a better carbon footprint than fossil raw materials. The alternative resources are allocated to the end product using the mass balance approach (see box on page 121).\n\nThe digital methodology we have developed to calculate PCFs meets general life cycle analysis standards such as ISO/uni00A0 14040, ISO/uni00A014044 and ISO/uni00A014067, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Standard, and has been certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland. We make  our  automated  PCF  calculation  approach  available  to interested industry players through partnerships. At the same time, we  are  involved  in  various  initiatives  to  drive  transparency, harmonization and standardization across the industry. One  example is Together for Sustainability (see box on page 116). In September 2022, the members of the initiative agreed on a globally uniform guideline  for  calculating  cradle-to-gate  PCFs  in  the  chemical industry. This will enable the climate impact of products to be directly  compared  and  evaluated  in  the  future  based  on  a standardized approach. A technical solution for sharing PCF data between  companies  is  under  development  and  should  be implemented by the end of 2023.\n\nHarmonizing  the  methodological  approaches  used  to  calculate PCFs also makes an important contribution to the more accurate measurement of the greenhouse gas emissions that arise in the",

These upstream Scope/uni00A03 emissions account for the largest share of our corporate carbon footprint (see page 139).\n\nWe currently use industrial averages and values from commercial databases as the basis for calculating upstream Scope/uni00A03 emissions. To obtain a more accurate data base and better manage and reduce emissions in the supply chain in the long term, we launched our global Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021. In a first step, we have since requested the PCFs of our raw materials and support our suppliers in determining these, for example, by sharing our knowledge of valuation and calculation methods with them. Since the start of the program, we have asked more than 1,300 suppliers, covering around  60% of our raw materials-related greenhouse gas emissions. In a second step, we want to work with our suppliers on solutions to reduce product-related emissions and establish the PCF as a criterion for purchasing decisions.\n\nFor more information on the Supplier CO2 Management Program, see basf.com/suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Low-carbon and carbon-free processes for climate-smart chemistry\n\nWe  are  also  developing  completely  new  technologies  for carbon-free and low-carbon production as part of our carbon management (new technologies lever). The main focus here is on basic  chemicals,  which  are  often  still  emissions-intensive  to produce. One example is steam reforming, the most common way of  obtaining  hydrogen.  We  are  already  testing  an  alternative process - methane pyrolysis - in Ludwigshafen, Germany. This is virtually carbon-free if renewable energy is used and extremely energy efficient compared with other methods. Together with Siemens Energy, and depending on funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), we are also planning to build a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer in Ludwigshafen with an output of 54/uni00A0megawatts for carbon-free hydrogen production.\n\nAnother  example  is  steam  crackers.  Steam  crackers  split petroleum into olefins and aromatics for further processing - both important groups of substances for numerous chemical value chains. The cracking reaction requires high temperatures of around 850/uni00A0degrees Celsius, which are achieved in conventional plants by burning  methane.  Heating  concepts  that  use  electricity  from renewable sources instead could reduce process-related emissions by at least 90% in the future. To test the feasibility of this new process and two different heating concepts, in September/uni00A02022 we started construction of a demonstration plant at the\n\nLudwigs hafen site in Germany together with our partners SABIC and Linde. The project has been granted \u20ac14.8/uni00A0million from the BMWK under the Decarbonization in Industry funding program. It is scheduled for start-up in 2023.\n\nWe also want to break new ground in steam supply, which we need  for  many  chemical  processes  and  have  so  far  mainly produced in our central gas-fired power plants. Here, too, green power-based technologies such as heat pumps or electric boilers offer enormous potential. For instance, we want to recover the thermal energy produced by our production and infrastructure facilities  in  the  future  and  use  it  for  carbon-optimized  steam generation. In this context, we initiated a feasibility study with MAN Energy  Solutions  in  July  2022  on  the  construction  of  an industrial-scale heat pump at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany (see page 138).\n\nAnother focus area is carbon capture and storage (CCS). For example, we are part of an industrial CCS project at the Antwerp site in Belgium (Kairos@C) as the first phase of the Antwerp@C project, which will enable BASF to avoid the emission of up to 1/uni00A0 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year from production.",

We have defined our global standards for emissions to air, waste and contaminated sites in Group-wide guidelines, the implementation of which is the responsibility  of  the  sites  and  Group  companies.  The  Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor compliance with legal requirements and internal guidelines.\n\nBASF's global network of experts shares information, insights and best practices on an ongoing basis to further reduce our emissions to air, manage waste and responsibly handle contaminated sites.\n\nContinuous documentation and monitoring of emissions to air, waste streams and contaminated sites as well as the imple mentation of measures for improvement are an integral part of our environmental management. In addition to greenhouse gases (see page/uni00A0135  onward), we also measure and analyze other air pollutants to  prevent the emission of potentially harmful substances.\n\nOur waste management is based on the systematic tracking of our material flows and follows a clear hierarchy: We aim to avoid waste as far as possible, for example, by continuously optimizing our processes or developing new production methods. BASF's Verbund structure with its networked plants and value chains is key here: The by-products  of  one  plant  serve  as  feedstock  elsewhere  in  the BASF/uni00A0Verbund, avoiding waste and enabling us to use raw materials as efficiently as possible.\n\nIf these cannot be used within BASF's Verbund structures, we assess whether they can be recycled or thermally recovered. We have established processes for the safe, proper and  environmentally responsible disposal of materials that we cannot recycle or where recycling is not legally permitted.

This  is  also reflected in our position paper on water protection , which we published in 2021.\n\nOur global standards and requirements for water are defined in Group-wide guidelines. Among other things, these stipulate that water protection concepts must be implemented at all production\n\nsites.  The  guidelines  also  cover  aspects  such  as  process  and transportation safety (see pages 126 and 134) in order to prevent production and transportation-related product spillages into water bodies as far as possible. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and complying with internal guidelines and legal requirements. The Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this. BASF's global network of experts shares information, insights and best practices around the responsible use of water on an ongoing basis.\n\nIntroducing and implementing sustainable water management has been a cornerstone of our strategy for many years now. Our focus here is on our Verbund sites and on production sites in water stress areas. 1 The aim is to protect water as a resource, to use it as/uni00A0 efficiently as possible through recirculation, and to continuously reduce wastewater and emissions. We consider the quantitative, qualitative and social aspects of water use.\n\nWe pursue our goal by applying the European Water Stewardship standard, which rests on four principles: sustainable water abstraction, maintaining good water quality, preserving conservation areas, and ensuring continuous improvement processes.\n\n- 1 We define water stress areas as regions in which more than 40% of available water is used by industry, households and agriculture. Our definition is based on the Water Risk Atlas (Aqueduct 3.0) published by the World Resources Institute. For more information, see wri.org/aqueduct.",

Where improvement is necessary, we support suppliers in developing and implementing appropriate measures, such as the correct handling of wastewater. In addition, we are involved in a wide range of initiatives to promote sustainability in the supply chain. For example, efficient water use is a core part of the Pragati project to improve sustainability in castor bean farming (see page 119).\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help purify water and use it/uni00A0 more  efficiently,  and  minimize  pollution.  These  include  highperformance plastics to produce ultrafiltration membranes, intermediates to produce flocculants for water treatment, or seeds with higher drought and heat tolerance.\n\nWe work with numerous partners along the value chain and from civil society to protect water as a resource. For instance, BASF is a member  of  the  Alliance  for  Water  Stewardship,  a  global  multistakeholder organization that promotes the responsible use of water. In addition, we are involved in networks to effectively prevent plastic waste from entering water bodies (see page 51).\n\nWe report transparently and comprehensively on water.

We achieved 61.6% of our target in 2022 (2021: 53.5%). 1 Sustainable water management was introduced at seven further sites in 2022 (2021:/uni00A07).\n\nAs part of sustainable water management, our sites regularly assess the water situation in the catchment area. This raises awareness of/uni00A0 potential risks and impacts for the population such as water scarcity. Based on the assessments conducted until the end of 2022, we did not identify any activities with a significant impact on water  availability and quality at any site.\n\n- 1 Our water target also continues to take into account the sites that we identified as water stress sites in accordance with Pfister et al.

One  example  is  the  Lake  Winnipeg  Basin  Water Stewardship Project in the Canadian province of Manitoba, which was launched in 2022.\n\n## Water balance\n\nOur water abstraction totaled 1,590/uni00A0million cubic meters in 2022 (2021: 1,695). This demand was covered for the most part by freshwater such as rivers and lakes (86% of water abstraction). At some sites, we use alternative sources such as treated municipal wastewater, brackish water or seawater. A small part of the water we use reaches our sites as part of raw materials and steam, or is released in our production processes. We abstract most of the  water we need for cooling and production ourselves. In 2022, 5% of our total water demand was covered by third parties (2021: 5%).\n\nWater  use in  2022  totaled  6,917/uni00A0 million  cubic  meters  (2021: 7,110/uni00A0million cubic meters). Put in relation to total water abstraction, this means that we use every liter we abstract around four times, or cover 79% of our water demand with reuse. We predominantly use water for cooling purposes (88% of water abstraction), after which we discharge it back to our supply sources with no product contact. We reduce our water abstraction for cooling purposes mainly by using recooling plants. Around 12% of our total water abstraction is used in production plants, for example, for extraction or dissolution processes or for cleaning. Here, too, we reduce our demand for water by recycling wastewater. Most of the water used for production purposes is discharged back to water bodies after being treated in our own or third-party wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe BASF/uni00A0 Group's water consumption describes the amount of water that is not discharged to a water body, meaning that it is no longer available to other users. Consumption is mainly attributable to the evaporation of water in recirculating cooling systems. A smaller amount is from the water contained in our products. Water\n\nconsumption in 2022 amounted to around 69/uni00A0million cubic meters (2021: 72/uni00A0million cubic meters).\n\nIn  2022,  around  25%  of  our  production  sites  were  located  in water stress areas (2021: 25%). These sites accounted for 1% of BASF's total water abstraction (2021: 1%). 1 In water stress areas, we  mainly source water from third parties (81%) and largely cover our demand with freshwater. Water consumption in water stress areas  accounted for 17% of BASF's total water consumption in 2022 (2021: 16%) and was primarily attributable to evaporation in cooling processes. Wastewater in water stress areas accounted for less than 1% of BASF's total wastewater. The share of wastewater from cooling processes in water stress areas is lower than for the BASF/uni00A0 Group as a whole. Cooling water is rarely used for oncethrough cooling here. Instead, it is generally recirculated to reduce water demand. Production wastewater in water stress areas is primarily treated at third-party facilities.\n\nThe supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is associated with a high energy demand. We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business and the environment.\n\n## Emissions to water\n\nOur wastewater is subject to strict controls and we carefully assess the impact of wastewater discharge in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Both internal audits and the responsible local authorities regularly assess whether the analyses and safety precautions at our sites comply with internal guidelines and legal requirements. A total of 1,400/uni00A0million cubic meters of water were discharged from BASF production sites in 2022 (2021: 1,503), including 163/uni00A0million cubic meters of wastewater from production. Emissions of nitrogen to water amounted to 2,600/uni00A0metric tons in 2022 (2021: 3,000). Around 10,600 metric tons of organic substances were emitted in wastewater (2021: 12,500). Our wastewater\n\ncontained 16/uni00A0metric tons of heavy metals (2021: 17). Phosphorus emissions amounted to 240/uni00A0metric tons (2021: 340).\n\nOur approach is to reduce wastewater volumes and contaminant loads at the source in our production processes and to reuse wastewater and material flows internally as far as possible. To treat wastewater, we use both central measures in wastewater treatment plants and the selective pretreatment of individual wastewater streams before these are sent to the wastewater treatment plant. We use different methods depending on the type and degree of contamination - including biological processes, chemical oxidation, membrane technologies, precipitation or adsorption. In order to avoid unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface water or groundwater, we have water protection concepts for our production plants in place. This is mandatory for all production plants as part of our Respon sible Care Management System (see page/uni00A0123). The wastewater protection plans involve evaluating wastewater in terms of risk  and  drawing  up  suitable  monitoring  approaches.  We  use audits to check that these measures are being implemented and complied with.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/water",

The loss of this diversity weakens ecosystems' ability to withstand changes such as climate change and poses a global challenge. As a chemical company, we depend on ecosystem services like the availability of renewable resources and high air, water and soil quality, while also influencing them. Protecting biodiversity is a key element of our commitment to sustainability.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Strategic alignment of our biodiversity measures based on impact  assessments\n- /uni25AA Commitment to preserving biodiversity along the entire value chain, for example, with strategic partnerships\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur specific measures along the entire value chain help to preserve biodiversity and meet our responsibility to the environment and society. Our corporate sustainability goals on climate protection, the circular economy, water management and responsible procurement also help to protect biodiversity. The United Nations' Convention on  Biological  Diversity  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs)/uni00A0 - including Life below water (SDG/uni00A0 14) and Life on land (SDG/uni00A015) - serve as important orientation and reference frameworks for BASF.\n\nWe align our biodiversity measures with the impact of our business activities along the value chain. Our focus here is on three areas: sites and production, product impact and supply chains. The five drivers  of  biodiversity  loss  defined  by  the  Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services are land-use change, climate change, pollution, overexploitation and\n\ninvasive species. We  counteract climate change - and in this way, help to preserve  biodiversity - with our climate protection measures (see page 135). We are committed to combating habitat loss, overexploitation and environmental pollution with activities along various value chains, including palm and palm kernel oil.\n\nTo be able to take the right measures, we need to understand how our actions affect the biodiversity of the affected ecosystems. Measuring biodiversity is a challenge, as a global indicator - like greenhouse gas emissions for climate change - does not yet exist. This is because the local context also has to be taken into account when assessing impact.\n\nWe use various methods to measure our sustainability performance that implicitly and explicitly consider relevant risks and opportunities  for  biodiversity.  These  include  the  Eco-Efficiency Analysis,   SEEbalance \u00ae , Sustainable Solution Steering as well as AgBalance \u00ae with its biodiversity calculator. We use indicators such as nitrogen emissions to water to measure drivers of biodiversity loss, and  indicators such as species occurrence to assess the status of  ecosystems. In addition, we regularly test various analysis tools available on the market. Newly developed assessment methods help us to understand further influences on biodiversity. On the basis of this understanding, we seek dialog with partners and enter into  strategic  partnerships,  through  which  we  drive  forward measures to protect biodiversity around the world.",

        "page_content": "An internal working group addresses company-wide governance and the systematic  identification of risks and opportunities arising from biodiversity.\n\n## Responsibility to our sites and production\n\nPreservation  of  biodiversity  is  taken  into  consideration  in  the management of our sites. We strive to operate our facilities in a responsible  manner  and  minimize  negative  effects  on  the environment  ( driver of biodiversity loss: pollution ) by keeping air, water and soil emissions as low as possible and reducing and avoiding waste (see page 142 for more information).\n\nConservation areas play a valuable role in preserving biodiversity and  natural  habitats.  In  2021,  we  added  an  indicator  to  our environmental database: proximity of production site to  internationally recognized  protected  areas.  We  use  databases  such  as  the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) here. This allows us to raise awareness of biodiversity at local level and assess and, if necessary, reduce potential impacts of our sites on these areas. In 2022, 5% of our production sites were adjacent to a Ramsar site 1 and 1% were adjacent to a category/uni00A0 I, II or III protected area as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 2 None of our production sites were adjacent to a UNESCO protected area.\n\nWe have adopted biodiversity as a criterion in processes such as our  risk  management.  In  addition,  we  systematically  consider sustainability  aspects  when  deciding  whether  to  invest  in  the construction of new sites or expand existing ones. Aspects  assessed include the potential impacts on forests and biodiversity.\n\nWe are also implementing local measures to protect biodiversity at a number of sites. For example, at 13/uni00A0 sites in North America, biodiversity projects are regularly audited and certified by the NGO Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). At the former Rensselaer production site in New York state, for example, BASF has been investing in\n\n- 1 Wetland of international importance in accordance with the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)\n- 2 We have defined 'adjacent' as the area within a 3/uni00A0km radius.\n\nsustainable land use for over 10/uni00A0years. The 90-hectare site on the Hudson  River  includes  a  LEED  Platinum-certified  environmental education classroom, a combined heat and power plant and a 10-hectare widlife habitat. The wildlife habitat was created as part of the Hudson River legacy remediation and ecological restoration project,  for  which  BASF  received  the  Environmental  Excellence Award  for  Environmental  Dredging  from  Western  Dredging Association in 2021. The biodiversity project improves site ecology, providing space for indigenous plants, foraging and nesting areas for a variety of animals, a way-station for migratory birds, and a habitat for aquatic species, amphibians and reptiles. For example, the aquatic turtle population in the freshwater wetland area could be restored.\n\nWe  also  take  biodiversity  conservation  into  account  in  our production. In addition, we are committed to complying with the provisions of international environmental agreements such as the Nagoya  Protocol.  The  supplementary  agreement  to  the  U.N.'s Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  regulates  access  to  genetic resources and benefit sharing. It sets out obligations (for example, compensation payments) for the users of genetic resources such as plant-based raw materials. We use internal control mechanisms to monitor compliance with these standards.\n\n## Good to know\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodiversity reserve in Brazil\n\nBASF has been involved in the conservation and regeneration of the forests of the Atlantic Rainforest for more than 30/uni00A0years. An eight-month biodiversity survey in collaboration with the Brazilian Espa\u00e7o ECO Foundation found a diversity of more than 200/uni00A0 animal and plant species in the 30-hectare Suvinil Reserve on the Brazilian paints and coatings industrial complex in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo (S\u00e3o Paulo state). This section of the Atlantic Rainforest, which accounts for almost half of the total area of the BASF site, shows how industry and the environment, productivity and sustainability can coexist. The Suvinil reserve is part of the  Brazilian BASF Demarchi + Ecoefficient program, which achieves more efficient use of natural resources and improves products and processes.",

        "page_content": "## Management of our product impact\n\nBASF offers products and solutions for a wide range of industries. We want to ensure that our products meet our customers'  standards in quality and, through appropriate use, pose no risk to humans, animals or the environment. Our commitment to the objectives set forth by the Responsible Care \u00ae charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) obligates us to continuously minimize the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and to optimize our products on an ongoing basis. It is important to consider the potential impacts of product use on biodiversity, for example, with regard to pollution.\n\nFor example, we evaluate our products and solutions in crop protection and seeds throughout the entire research, development and registration process. After they have been approved for the market, we continue assessing them regularly for potential risks and impact to the ecosystems in which they are used. We have initiated various projects and offer training to prevent misuse of our products (see page 132).\n\nAll types of land development, such as agriculture and forestry, play a role in changing biodiversity ( driver of biodiversity loss: land-use change ). Activities such as tillage, drainage, fertilization and the use of crop protection products can affect flora and fauna, for example, by influencing food sources. Minimizing these impacts while  ensuring the necessary productivity is one of the biggest challenges farmers are facing.\n\nOur Agricultural Solutions segment focuses on four areas to help farmers  to  find  the  right  balance  between  productivity  and sustainability. Focus areas are climate-smart farming, sustainable solutions,  digital  farming  and  smart  stewardship  (see  box  on page/uni00A034). In this context, we work with farmers to create balanced agricultural systems which enable productive and efficient farming of high- quality food products and at the same time promote bio di versity in the field. For example, we advise them on soil cultivation practices and look for suitable ways to improve biodiversity in farmlands. Our many years of experience in sustainability measurement\n\nand  evaluation in agriculture are particularly useful here. Our modern seed solutions also enable better yield on existing farmlands and thus help protect natural habitats.\n\nOur AgBalance \u00ae method and the biodiversity calculator enable a scientifically  sound  assessment  of  the  impact  of  agricultural practices on biodiversity. Based on these assessments, we issue recommendations for measures such as planting flower strips or establishing nesting places to benefit pollinators like wild bees and farmland birds.\n\nIn 2021, BASF initiated the approval process for a new, more environmentally friendly insecticidal active ingredient and has since submitted registration dossiers in all major markets. The active ingredient,  Axalion TM , enables farmers to control a wide range of piercing and sucking pests that are harmful to crops. At the same time, it is highly compatible with beneficial insects such as  pollinators. This supports farmers in managing the challenges they face around productivity, protecting the environment and societal demands.\n\nAnimal  farming  is  essential  to  meeting  growing  global  demand for products of animal origin such as meat, eggs and milk. This in turn leads to high demand for agricultural land for growing feed, which has implications for the share of forest areas and biodiversity. BASF offers a range of feed additives such as  enzymes, vitamins, glycinates and organic acids that improve  nutrient utilization from feed.  Better  feed  conversion  and  more   sustainable  livestock production  mean  that  less  land  is  needed,  preserving  natural ecosystems.\n\n## Responsibility to our supply chains\n\nSome of the business activities of our raw materials suppliers involve land uses that can influence biodiversity ( driver of biodiversity loss: land-use change ). We have laid down our expectations of our suppliers with regard to environmental, labor and social standards in the supply chain as well as our committment to preserving biodiversity in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A0115).\n\nBASF procures various renewable raw materials. As for fossil raw materials,  we  also  consider  how  renewable  resources  impact aspects of sustainability along the value chain. Alongside positive effects like avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, these can also have negative effects on areas such as biodiversity or land use, depending on the raw material.\n\nFor palm and palm kernel oil in particular, there is an elevated risk of deforestation  to  create  farmland.  To  improve  sustainability  in procurement, we established the BASF Palm Commitment in 2011, which was updated in 2015 and is implemented with our Palm Sourcing Policy. Third-party certification with standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard enables us to take biodiversity criteria into account when purchasing raw materials (see page 118).\n\nOur position on forest protection sets out our commitment to preserving biodiversity in areas of High Conservation Value such as High Carbon Stock forest areas and peatlands in the procurement of renewable raw materials. BASF again participated in the 'Forests' assessment conducted by the international organization CDP in 2022 and achieved a score of A-, once more giving it Leadership status. The assessment is conducted based on detailed insights into the palm value chain and activities that impact ecosystems and natural habitats.\n\nWe are also committed to the environmental sustainability of other supply chains through our own, targeted initiatives. One example is our  rambutan  program.  This  was  launched  in  2014  in  close collaboration with partners in Vietnam to source botanical  ingredients for cosmetic products from certified organic rambutan gardens. In cooperation  with  local  farmers  and  NGOs,  BASF's  program promotes the preservation of biodiverse habitats, as well as good agricultural practices, gender equity and fair working conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the CDP forests questionnaire, see basf.com/en/cdp",

        "page_content": "## Strategic partnerships to promote biodiversity\n\nEngaging in ongoing dialog with a variety of stakeholders is  important to BASF. That is why we seek out partnerships with relevant interest groups and organizations worldwide to raise awareness of biodiversity and drive forward the action needed to preserve natural habitats. This enables us to firstly share the knowledge gained from our biodiversity activities and secondly learn from others to improve our own practices.\n\nWe cooperate with a number of organizations including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Sustainable Palm Oil Forum, the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the High Carbon  Stock  Approach  Steering  Group.  The  Taskforce  on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is working to provide a framework for reporting on nature-related risks and related activities. In  2021,  BASF  joined  the  newly  established  TNFD  Forum,  a consultative network, to support this development. Our involvement in organizations such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the Alliance for Water Stewardship (see page 144) help to preserve biodiversity in bodies of water.\n\nTogether with international partners and based on dialog with stakeholders  in  the  food  value  chain,  we  are  driving  forward measures to promote sustainable agriculture. In the United States, for example, BASF is a member of the Honey Bee Health Coalition, which aims to achieve healthy honey bee populations and support healthy populations of native and managed pollinators in productive agricultural systems and thriving ecosystems. BASF France is part of  the  Entreprises  pour  l'Environnement  (EpE)  network,  which launched the Act4nature campaign with the main objective of protecting and enhancing biodiversity.\n\nSince 2013, we have also been working with different farmers and experts from the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability, an association of farms in Europe, to integrate more connected biodiversity areas into  agricultural  production.  By  creating  and  maintaining  new habitats and linking habitats for living, breeding and feeding with each other, biodiversity can be sustainably promoted in a modern,\n\nconventional agriculture. Based on the insights gained from working together, an advisory board of experts from agriculture, nature conservation and environmental protection developed a biodiversity checklist and published it in 2021. This summarizes 10 ecologically effective measures to promote biodiversity. Since 2021, BASF has supported farmers participating in its #wirzahlenBiodiversit\u00e4t ('We pay biodiversity') program financially and with professional advice.\n\n- For more information on our responsible management of resources, see page/uni00A043\n\nFor more information on product stewardship, see pages 130 and 132\n\n- For more information on our commitment to biodiversity, see basf.com/biodiversity For more information on our position on forest protection, see basf.com/forestprotection",

        "page_content": "## Forecast\n\nWe expect the global economy to grow only weakly by 1.6% in 2023 (2022: +3.0%). High raw materials costs, rising  consumer prices and higher interest rates will depress demand worldwide. We are also assuming that the positive post- pandemic effects have already run their course. We expect growth of only 1.8% for global industrial production (2022: +2.5%) and 2.0% for global chemical production (2022: +2.2%). Uncertainty about future developments  remains high.\n\n## Economic Environment in 2023 1\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Stagnation expected in Europe and the United States\n- /uni25AA Moderately higher growth in Asia\n- /uni25AA Fragile recovery in the automotive industry\n- /uni25AA Moderate growth in the industry as a whole\n- /uni25AA Weak growth in global chemical production\n- /uni25AA Further decline in European chemical production\n\nIn the European Union, gross domestic product is expected to stagnate on the back of high energy costs. High regional natural gas/uni00A0 prices will continue to weigh heavily on production in energyintensive  industries.  Consequently,  we  anticipate  a  significant decrease in chemical production in the E.U. at a similar rate to 2022. In North America, too, we expect gross domestic product to stagnate and chemical production to decline slightly. For China, we are forecasting slightly higher GDP growth compared with the previous year, while growth in other emerging Asian economies will proba bly weaken. Growth in chemical production in the Asian region as a whole is likely to remain stable overall.\n\nUncertainty about future developments remains exceptionally high. The future development of the war in Ukraine and its impact on economic growth is virtually impossible to predict. Our forecast assumes that the conflict does not escalate further. We are assuming that an acute gas shortage with regulatory cuts in natural gas supply to energy-intensive industries in Europe can be avoided. Moreover, we do not expect China's departure from its zero-COVID strategy to have any adverse effects that would significantly reduce China's growth or that of its trading partners.\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2023\n\nWe expect GDP to stagnate in the European Union (E.U.) (2023: +0.1%,  2022:  +3.6%).  The  support  measures  taken  by  many E.U./uni00A0 countries to mitigate the impact of the sharp rise in gas and electricity prices on households and small and medium-sized enterprises will help to prevent a stronger decline. The E.U. countries with a comparatively high industrial share of value added and a high share of natural gas in energy supply are likely to suffer further losses. As a result, we expect gross domestic product to decrease by 0.7% in Germany and by 0.4% in Italy. French GDP will presumably stagnate. The only major E.U. country expected to see slight\n\n- 1 Our assumptions account for current estimates by external institutions, including economic research institutes, banks, multinational organizations and consulting firms.\n\nIn this section: Economic Environment in 2023 Outlook 2023 Opportunities and Risks\n\ngrowth is Spain (+1.0%). Average GDP in the Eastern E.U. countries will probably stagnate (+0.3%).\n\nIn the United Kingdom , we expect GDP to decline by 1.2% (2022: +4.1%) due to sharp increases in the cost of living and interest rates, which will depress private consumption and investment.\n\nGDP in the United States is expected to stagnate in 2023. U.S. monetary policy is steering a restrictive course in order to  further reduce the high inflation rate, which is already declining slightly. High interest rates are slowing construction activity, credit- financed purchases of durable goods and capital expenditures. Offsetting factors include good labor market data and government growth stimulus under the infrastructure program and the Infla tion Reduction Act. Low gas prices by international standards will also improve the inter na tional competitiveness of energy- intensive indus tries  in the United States.\n\nIn the emerging markets of Asia , we expect growth to be slightly higher overall (+4.4%) than in 2022 (+3.8%). This is solely due to higher expected growth in China (+4.5% in 2023 compared with +3.0% in 2022). For the other emerging markets in Asia, we expect growth to decline overall from 5.5% in 2022 to 4.3% in 2023. In",

        "page_content": "India, growth is expected to slow to 5.2% (2022: +7.0%). Western trading  partners'  weak  performance  will  negatively  impact  the emerging Asian economies. At the same time, their currencies have depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar in the past year, making energy imports in particular more expensive. We assume that this will be countered by a recovery in domestic  demand in China following the lifting of the zero-COVID strategy.\n\nIn Japan , growth is also expected to slow due to weaker export demand from Western trading partners and the weaker yen, which will make imports more expensive. Conversely, higher growth in China, reduced bottlenecks for semiconductors for the Japanese automotive industry and the continued accomodative course of Japanese monetary policy will support the Japanese economy. We therefore expect only a slight decline in growth overall (2023: +1.0%, 2022: +1.2%).\n\nIn South America , growth is expected to weaken significantly in 2023. Private consumption in Brazil will no longer be supported by fiscal measures as in the previous year. Given the generally weak global economy, export demand is not expected to provide any additional  strong  stimulus  either.  The  Argentinian  economy  is suffering from very high and rising inflation rates. In addition, the scope for additional government spending is severely restricted by the debt restructuring program. The global economic slowdown will also put pressure on raw materials prices. South America is unlikely to benefit from significantly rising export prices for industrial and agricultural commodities in 2023. Overall, we expect GDP in the region to grow by 0.8% in 2023 (2022: +3.7%).\n\n## Outlook for gross domestic product 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                      | 1.6%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n| European Union                             | 0.1%   |\n| United States                              | 0.2%   |\n| Emerging markets   of Asia excluding China |        |\n| China                                      |        |\n| Japan                                      | 1.0%   |\n| South America                              | 0.8%   |\n\n## Trends in gross domestic product 2023-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Average annual real change World           | 2.3%   | 2.3%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| European Union                             | 1.0%   | 1.0%   |\n| United States                              | 1.1%   | 1.1%   |\n| Emerging markets   of Asia excluding China |        | 4.9%   |\n| China                                      |        | 4.9%   |\n| Japan                                      | 1.1%   | 1.1%   |\n| South America                              | 1.8%   | 1.8%   |\n\n## Outlook for key customer industries\n\nOverall, we anticipate growth of 1.8% (2022: +2.5%) in global industrial production. Industrial production is expected to contract in the advanced economies (2023: -0.3%, 2022: +0.9%). Growth in the emerging markets will probably remain at a similar level to the previous year (2023: +3.5%, 2022: +3.8%).\n\nFor  the transportation  industry , 1 we  are  forecasting  lower growth of 2.8% in 2023 compared with the previous year (+5.7%). Although supply bottlenecks in the automotive industry, especially\n\n- 1 The transportation industry includes the production of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and the construction of other vehicles (especially ships and boats, trains, air and spacecraft, and two-wheelers).\n\nsemiconductor shortages, are expected to ease further, demand for/uni00A0 motor vehicles will cool due to declining purchasing power and/uni00A0  rising interest rates. We expect global production volumes of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to rise to around 84/uni00A0 million units in the coming year (2022: 82/uni00A0 million units). This means that the total number of vehicles produced is still almost 9% below pre-pandemic levels (around 92/uni00A0 million vehicles produced annually on average from 2015 to 2019). We expect the expansion of electromobility to progress rapidly and the share of total production volumes attributable to purely battery-electric vehicles to rise significantly from 10% in 2022 to almost 14% in 2023.\n\nThe catch-up effects in the European and North American automotive markets following the pandemic-related disruptions to supply chains are expected to slowly taper off. For both markets, we are assuming further but slower growth than in 2022. Following the significant increase in production in the previous year, we also anticipate weaker market growth in China. We also expect growth rates to decline overall in the other emerging markets of Asia. For Japan, on the other hand, we are forecasting a recovery in growth from a low baseline.\n\nIn the energy and raw materials sector, we expect lower growth in output overall due to the macroeconomic slowdown, mainly as a result of weaker growth in demand for oil and gas. Regional growth rates will vary considerably. Oil and gas production should continue to grow strongly in the United States but decline in Asia. In Europe, production will probably stagnate. By contrast, production of other non-agricultural commodities will grow at high, stable rates in Asia, stagnate in the United States and decline in Europe.\n\nGrowth in the construction industry is expected to continue to slow. Residential construction is likely to contract due to higher mortgage rates in Europe and the United States and the further cooling of the housing market in China. For other building construction, we expect weak growth roughly at the level of the previous year. By contrast, we are forecasting higher year-on-year growth for",

        "page_content": "the infrastructure segment, which should benefit from rising public spending in both the E.U. and the United States.\n\nConsumer goods production is expected to grow only slightly faster than global GDP. The declining purchasing power of private households will have a particularly negative impact on demand for durable consumer goods, for example from the furniture industry. After production declined in 2022, we expect only slight growth for the textile industry, exclusively in the emerging markets. Growth in/uni00A0 production of consumables, particularly in care products, will presumably weaken in line with GDP growth.\n\nThe electronics industry is also expected to grow at a slower pace in 2023 than in the previous year as private demand for PCs, personal communication devices and consumer electronics is dampened by high consumer price inflation, and many major purchases with long service lives were brought forward during corona virus lockdowns. However, growth will be supported by the ongoing digitalization trend, meaning that growth rates should  significantly outpace global GDP.\n\nIn the health and nutrition sector, we expect growth to be slightly higher and above GDP. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to return to slightly stronger growth after low growth in 2022 due to the vaccine boom in the previous year. Overall, food production will also increase at a slightly stronger rate than in the previous year but with wide regional differences. We expect lower growth for the advanced economies but slightly stronger year-on-year growth for the emerging markets due to the gradual recovery in China.\n\nAgricultural production is expected to grow at a similar rate in 2023 to the average for recent years. Around 80% of growth will come from Asia, which is responsible for two-thirds of global agricultural production. Agricultural production in Asia and South America will outpace world production. For North America and Europe, we are only assuming slight growth.\n\n## Outlook for the chemical industry\n\nGlobal chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) is expected to grow by 2.0% in 2023, slower than in the previous year (2022: +2.2%). We again anticipate a decline in production in the advanced economies (2023: -3.0%, 2022: -2.9%). Growth in the emerging markets is expected to slow slightly (2023: +4.4%, 2022: +4.8%).\n\nIn China , the world's largest chemical market, we are forecasting slightly weaker growth in chemical production of 5.9% (2022: +6.6%). We expect the opening of the Chinese economy to bring with it higher growth in Chinese domestic demand, especially in the consumer goods industries and the health and nutrition sector, as well as positive contributions to growth from the automotive and electronics industries.\n\nChemical production in the E.U. should again decrease by 5.2% (2022: -5.8%), well below the overall industrial development  forecast for Europe. Due to the high energy costs, no major catch-up effects are  expected  in  energy-intensive  basic  chemicals  following  the already strongly negative prior year. Growth should mainly be driven by demand from the automotive industry. By contrast, consumption of durable and non-durable consumer goods is not likely to increase. We also expect chemical production in the United Kingdom to continue to decline (2023: -5.5%, 2022: -5.0%).\n\nIn the United States , the positive base effects that supported growth in 2022 will come to an end. Domestic demand will largely stagnate, with the exception of the automotive industry, the energy sector and the electronics industry. Demand from the construction industry is expected to decline on the back of high interest rates. Export demand for chemicals from Europe should provide positive momentum given the lower raw materials and energy prices.  Overall, we expect a slight decline in chemical production (2023: -2.0%, 2022: +2.3%).\n\nFor Japan , we are forecasting a weak recovery after the decline in the previous year (2023: +1.0%, 2022: -3.0%). Growth stimulus here is expected to come primarily from the automotive sector.\n\nSouth America will presumably see much lower growth in chemical production (2023: +0.9%, 2022: +2.6%). Demand from the consumer goods industries is expected to grow at a similarly weak rate to GDP. By contrast, we expect demand from the agricultural sector to increase more strongly and demand from the automotive industry to  remain solid but with weaker growth than in the previous year.\n\n## Outlook for chemical production 2023 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                      | 2.0%   | 2.0%   | 2.0%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| European Union                             | -5.2%  |        |        |\n| United States                              | -2.0%  |        |        |\n| Emerging markets   of Asia excluding China |        | 1.0%   |        |\n| China                                      |        |        |        |\n| Japan                                      |        | 1.0%   |        |\n| South America                              |        | 0.9%   |        |\n\n## Trends in chemical production 2023-2025 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                      | 2.7%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n| European Union                             | -1.1%  |\n| United States                              | 0.1%   |\n| Emerging markets   of Asia excluding China | 2.7%   |\n| China                                      | 4.8%   |\n| Japan                                      | 0.9%   |\n| South America                              | 1.7%   |",

        "page_content": "## Outlook 2023\n\nThe high level of uncertainty that arose over the course of 2022 due to the war in Ukraine, high raw materials and energy costs in Europe, rising prices and interest rates, inflation and the development of the coronavirus pandemic will continue in 2023. All of these factors will negatively impact global demand, which is why we only expect moderate growth for the global economy in 2023.\n\n## Outlook for 2023 at a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Sales of between \u20ac84/uni00A0billion and \u20ac87/uni00A0billion\n- /uni25AA EBIT before special items of between \u20ac4.8/uni00A0billion and \u20ac5.4/uni00A0billion\n- /uni25AA ROCE of between 7.2% and 8.0%\n- /uni25AA CO2 emissions of between 18.1/uni00A0million metric tons and 19.1/uni00A0million metric tons\n- /uni25AA Capex of around \u20ac6.3/uni00A0billion\n\nWe anticipate moderate growth in the majority of our customer industries and expect the slight recovery in the automotive industry in particular to continue. Our forecast assumes that the war in Ukraine will continue but not escalate further, although the further development of the war in Ukraine and its effects on economic growth are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In addition, we are assuming that an acute gas shortage with regu latory cuts in/uni00A0 natural gas supply to energy-intensive industries in Europe will not/uni00A0 materialize. We expect China's departure from its zero-COVID strategy to have a positive impact on the development of demand.\n\nThe global economy is expected to grow by only 1.6% in 2023 (2022: 3.0%). We expect growth of 1.8% for global industrial production (2022: 2.5%), while global chemical production is likely to expand by 2.0% in 2023 (2022: 2.2%). Our planning assumes an average oil price of $90/uni00A0for a barrel of Brent crude and an  exchange\n\nrate of $1.05/uni00A0per euro. We anticipate elevated and very volatile gas prices in Europe.\n\n- For more information on our expectations for the economic environment in 2023,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsee page/uni00A0151 onward\n\nFor more information on the material opportunities and risks that could affect our forecast, see page/uni00A0157 onward\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the BASF Group 1\n\nThe BASF Group is expected to generate sales of between \u20ac84/uni00A0billion and \u20ac87/uni00A0billion in 2023. Planned volume growth in all segments will contribute here. We anticipate slight sales growth in the Agricultural Solutions and Materials segments, mainly driven by higher prices and volumes in both segments. Sales in Other should be slightly higher. We are forecasting sales at prior-year level in the Nutrition/uni00A0 & Care segment. We anticipate lower price levels, especially for basic chemicals and precious metals, which will lead to a slight sales decrease in the Chemicals and Surface Technologies segments. The Industrial Solutions segment is also expected to see slightly lower sales due to the sale of the kaolin minerals business.\n\nThe BASF Group's EBIT before special items is expected to decline to between \u20ac4.8/uni00A0billion and \u20ac5.4/uni00A0billion. Our planning for the Agricultural Solutions segment assumes a slight increase in EBIT before special items. In the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care, Surface Technologies and Industrial Solutions segments, we expect slightly lower EBIT before special items. We anticipate significantly lower con tri butions from the Chemicals and Materials segments and from Other. We expect a weak first half of 2023 followed by an improved  earnings\n\nenvironment in the second half of the year due to recovery effects, especially in China.\n\nBased on the weaker earnings performance and slightly higher cost of capital basis forecast for the BASF/uni00A0Group in 2023, we expect a ROCE of between 7.2% and 8.0%. ROCE should increase slightly in the Agricultural Solutions segment. In the Industrial Solutions and Surface Technologies segments, ROCE is likely to decline slightly. Compared with the previous year, we anticipate a considerable decrease in ROCE in the Chemicals, Materials and Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segments.\n\n## CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nCO2 emissions are expected to be between 18.1/uni00A0million metric tons and  19.1/uni00A0 million  metric  tons  in  2023.  We  anticipate  additional emissions from moderate growth in production and slightly higher capacity utilization at emissions-intensive plants. For example, the ammonia plants in Europe will probably see higher capacity utilization compared with 2022 but will continue to run at low levels due to/uni00A0 sustained high gas prices. We will counteract this increase with targeted measures to reduce emissions, further increase energy efficiency and optimize processes and, above all, continue the shift to electricity from renewable energies.\n\n- 1 For sales, 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-5.0%, while 'considerable' applies to changes of 5.1% and higher. 'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0.0%). For earnings, 'slight' means a change of 0.1%-10.0%, while  'considerable' is used for changes of 10.1% and higher. 'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0.0%). For ROCE, we define a change of 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points as 'slight,' a change of more than 1.0 percentage points as  'considerable' and no change (+/-0.0 percentage points) as 'at prior-year level.'",

This will be driven by pressure on prices caused by higher product availability overall as new production capacities come on stream and supply chain problems ease. An expected recovery in demand, especially in  China,  will  lead  to  volume  growth  in  the  segment.  This  will presumably not be able to fully compensate for the negative price effects. The lower prices will also put pressure on margins. Consequently, we are forecasting a considerable decline in EBIT before special items in/uni00A0both operating divisions. In addition, earnings performance will be/uni00A0 negatively  impacted by significantly higher fixed costs,  mainly  from  invest ments  in  the  construction  of  the  new Verbund site in  Zhanjiang, China, and in the expansion of the eth ylene oxide plant in/uni00A0 Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nWe are forecasting slight sales growth for the Materials segment. Given the continued volatile market environment, we anticipate higher prices driven by raw materials costs in the Monomers  division. Slight volume growth overall will contribute to the sales  increase. However,  we  are  seeing  diverging  trends  within  the  segment: The Performance Materials division will presumably record volume growth in all customer industries. By contrast, we anticipate slightly lower sales volumes in the Monomers division. We are forecasting a considerable decrease in the segment's EBIT before special items  due  to  earnings  development  in  the  Monomers  division. The  division's EBIT before special items is expected to decline considerably as a result of lower margins, after strong margins in 2022. In the Performance Materials division, by contrast, we anticipate considerable growth in EBIT before special items due to the positive development of sales volumes amid stable margins.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur planning for the Industrial Solutions segment assumes slightly lower sales in both divisions in 2023. The volume growth targeted for the Performance Chemicals division will only partially offset the effect on sales of the divestiture of the kaolin minerals business as of September 30, 2022, and expected price declines due to lower demand. The slight sales decrease in the Dispersions/uni00A0& Resins division will mainly reflect lower volumes on the back of softer demand. We are forecasting a slight decline in the segment's EBIT before special items. This will primarily result from considerably lower EBIT before special items expected in the Dispersions/uni00A0& Resins division due to weaker margins. This will only be partially offset by considerable earnings growth in the Performance Chemicals division, mainly from higher volumes.\n\nIn the Surface Technologies segment, we are forecasting a slight sales decrease compared with 2022. This will primarily be driven by/uni00A0 a significant decline in precious metal prices expected in the Catalysts division. Sales will be boosted by higher prices in the Coatings division and forecast volume growth in both divisions. The segment's EBIT before special items is expected to decline slightly. We  expect considerably higher EBIT before special items in the Coatings division as a result of higher margins and volumes. In the/uni00A0 Catalysts division, by contrast, we anticipate a considerable decrease due to weaker margins caused by high raw materials prices and lower precious metal prices.\n\nWe expect sales in the Nutrition/uni00A0& Care segment to be at prior- year level. Prices are expected to be lower overall as a result of declining raw materials prices. This will be compensated by volume growth in both operating divisions due to improved product availability and an easing of global supply chains. The segment's EBIT before special items should be slightly below the prior-year figure.\n\nIn the Agricultural Solutions segment, we expect slight sales growth in 2023. This will be mainly driven by higher prices while demand for agrochemicals and seeds will remain on a continuously high level. Based on the sales increase and a positive margin development, we are forecasting slightly higher EBIT before special items.",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities and Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe goal of BASF's risk management is to identify and evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and to take appropriate measures in order to seize opportunities and limit risks. The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF's continued existence and to make improved managerial decisions to create value. We define opportunities as potential successes that exceed our defined goals. We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact the achievement of our short-term operational or long-term strategic goals.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Integrated process for opportunity and risk identification, assessment and reporting\n- /uni25AA Decentralized management of specific opportunities and risks: aggregate reporting at Group level\n- /uni25AA Material opportunities and risks for 2023 arise from overall economic developments and margin volatility\n\nWhere appropriate, we measure and manage opportunities and risks in terms of probability and economic impact in the event they occur. Where possible, we use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk factors. In addition, we use a qualitative evaluation scale for opportunities and risks to assess both business and sustainability aspects that cannot be quantified. In this way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks allowing us to aggregate risks at Group level and take effective risk management measures.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nFor 2023, we expect global economic growth to weaken as a result of high energy prices and inflation rates, rising interest rates and the phasing out of catch-up effects from the coronavirus pandemic. General economic uncertainty will remain exceptionally high.\n\nA further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, for example in China, could  lead  to  disruptions  in  global  supply  chains  and  greater\n\nrestrictions on the supply of energy, industrial raw materials and intermediates. The war in Ukraine poses significant risks for market development in Europe.\n\nWeaker growth in China as a result of ongoing pandemic-related disruptions may give rise to risks for supply chains as well as the development of global demand.\n\nIn addition, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding  con sum ers' reaction to the sharp rise in energy prices, inflation and the  resulting loss of purchasing power. Opportunities will arise in par ticu lar from stronger growth in demand resulting from an improved overall economic  environment.\n\nDue to the exceptionally volatile markets, especially in Europe, the risks  arising  from  European  gas  price  developments  and  the availability of natural gas cannot currently be reliably estimated. The assump tions in our planning for 2023 are based on European gas prices that significantly exceed the 2019-2021 average. The overall assessment therefore does not include any additional opportunities or risks that could arise from the volatility of European gas prices.\n\nThe gas price brake in Germany and measures taken by other E.U. countries mean that these risks are partially mitigated by the state.\n\nFurthermore, BASF will take internal measures, such as adjustments to production processes, if energy prices remain high. We are also responding to structurally higher energy costs with cost reduction measures.\n\nWe are continually monitoring the further development of natural gas prices. In the event of regulatory changes or changes in the market environment, we will adjust the overall assessment of opportunities and risks accordingly.\n\nAccording to our assessment, there continue to be no significant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of the BASF/uni00A0Group. The same applies to the sum of individual risks, even in the case of a global economic crisis.\n\nUltimately, however, residual risks (net risks) remain in all entrepreneurial activities that cannot be ruled out, even by comprehensive risk management.\n\nAs a non-integral shareholding, income from Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG is reported in net income from shareholdings. The opportunities and risks resulting from the shareholding in Wintershall Dea are therefore not included in the outlook for the EBIT of the BASF/uni00A0 Group. Opportunities and risks that have an impact on net income from shareholdings and cash flow from the shares in Wintershall Dea are monitored and tracked through BASF's involvement in the relevant governing bodies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the non-integral, equity-accounted shareholding in Wintershall Dea, see Note/uni00A010 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 231 onward",

Its key features are as follows:\n\n## Organization and responsibilities\n\n- - Risk management and the internal control system is the responsibility of the Board of Executive Directors. It defines the basic require ments and processes as well as the organization of the risk/uni00A0 management system. It also determines the processes for approv ing investments, acquisitions and divestitures.\n- - The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the Corporate Center. Corporate Finance and Corporate Development, which are units within the Corporate Center, and the Chief Compliance Officer  (CCO)  coordinate  the  risk  management  process  at  a Group level, examine financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks, and provide the structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and risk management is thus  integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes.\n- - BASF's risk committee reviews the BASF/uni00A0Group's risk portfolio at least twice a year to evaluate any adjustments to risk management measures and informs the Board of Executive Directors of/uni00A0 these. Members of the risk committee are the president of Corporate Finance (chair), the president of Corporate Development, the president of Corporate Legal, Compliance/uni00A0& Insurance and the heads of the Corporate Audit, Corporate Environmental Protection, Health, Safety/uni00A0 & Quality, Corporate Treasury, and Group Reporting/uni00A0& Performance Management departments.\n- - The management and control of specific opportunities and risks is largely delegated to the divisions, the service and research units and the regions, and is steered at a regional or local level. This also applies to sustainability-related topics relevant to BASF includ ing  the   impact of climate change on BASF. A network of risk managers in the divisions, service and research units as well as in/uni00A0 the regions advances the implementation of appropriate risk management practices in daily operations. Financial risks are an\n\nexception. The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is conducted in the Corporate Finance department. The management of commodity price risks takes place in the Global Procurement unit or in authorized Group companies.\n\n- - The  BASF/uni00A0 Group's  management  is  informed  of  short-term operational opportunities and risks that fall within an observation period of up to one year in the monthly management report produced by Corporate Finance. In addition, Corporate Finance provides information twice a year on the aggregated opportunity/ risk  exposure  of  the  BASF/uni00A0 Group.  Furthermore,  any  arising individual risks which have an impact of more than \u20ac10/uni00A0million on earnings or risks qualitatively evaluated to have a material impact, such as reputational risks, must be reported immediately.\n- - As part of strategy development, the Corporate Development department  additionally  conducts  strategic  opportunity/risk analyses with a 10-year assessment period. These analyses are annually reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if necessary. Scenarios were also developed to map possible impacts  beyond  the  ten-year  horizon,  for  example  from climate-related  developments.\n- - We  also  regularly  consider  exceptional  situations  at  global, regional and local level - from process safety incidents and goods spillages to pandemics and cyberattacks - which occur very rarely but can have a fundamental impact. In addition, a crisis organization exists to proactively create contingency plans where necessary and appropriate. The crisis management organization is activated in the event of a sudden crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on health and safety and emergency response, see page 125 onward\n\n- - BASF's CCO manages the implementation of our Compliance Management  System,  supported  by  additional  compliance officers worldwide. The CCO regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on the status of implementation as well as on/uni00A0 any significant results and provides a status report to the Supervisory  Board's  Audit  Committee  at  least  once  a  year, including  any  major  developments.

The results of the monitoring processes are incorporated into regular risk reporting to the Risk Committee and the Board of Executive Directors. Compared with internal control systems in financial reporting, these monitoring systems have a lower degree of formalization.\n- - The Corporate Audit department is responsible for regularly auditing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the risk management system, internal control systems and the compliance management system. In addition, the Supervisory Board's Audit Com mittee addresses the effectiveness and appropriateness of these systems as part of its monitoring activities. The suitability of the early risk detection system set up by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section/uni00A091(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act is assessed and evaluated by the auditors.\n\n## Tools\n\n- - The Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC) Policy, applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for risk management and is implemented by the operating divisions, the service and research units and the regions according to their specific business conditions.\n- - A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps identify all relevant financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks relating to our targets as comprehensively as possible. Here, we take into account topics identified by the materiality analysis that we have an impact on and that have an impact on us, in line with the principle of double materiality.\n- For more information on the materiality analysis, see page 46 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Organization of BASF Group's risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The Corporate Audit department is part of the Corporate Center.\n- - We also systematically assess opportunities and risks with effects that cannot yet be measured in monetary terms, such as climate and reputational risks. To reflect these, risks for companies in connection with the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risks) as well as physical risks as defined by the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), among others, were added to this catalog.\n- - Because global climate policy ambitions and the implementation of the relevant measures play a decisive role in the ongoing growth of the chemical industry and its customer industries, we defined and quantified global long-term scenarios (up to 2050) with various global warming paths. To assess the impact of different global  climate policy approaches on our business units, the scenarios  were  discussed  by  the  business  units  in  workshops. Feedback was  incorporated into the ongoing development of the scenarios. A dataset of scenario-specific macroeconomic\n\nparameters will be provided to test the economic feasibility of invest ments and  business strategies.\n\nFor more information on our sustainability management processes, see page 45 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the identifi ca tion and assessment of risks. The aggregation of opportunities, risks and sensitivities at division and Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects and trends across the Group. We also aggregate qualitatively assessed risks at Group level using a risk portfolio.\n- - Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company's internal guidelines. Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these man datory standards into everyday business.  Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these principles.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- -Based on the reviews and findings of the risk management process, the Board of Executive Directors has no indication that BASF's risk management system, including the internal control system, is not adequate or effective in its entirety.\n\n## Significant features of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the Group financial reporting  process\n\nThe Group Management's Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements  are  prepared  by  a  unit  in  the  Corporate  Finance department. The Consolidated Financial Statements are derived from the separate financial statements of the subsidiaries and joint operations,  taking  into  account  the  relevant  data  for  the  joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the equity method. The BASF/uni00A0 Group's accounting process is based on a uniform accounting guideline that, alongside accounting policies based on the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable in the European Union, defines the significant processes and deadlines for the Group. There are binding directives for the  internal reconciliations and other accounting operations within the Group. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting  processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consoli dated Financial Statements. There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant in these processes.\n\nEmployees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and service units involved. We strictly adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control or the 'four-eyes principle.' Complex actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualified employees.\n\nAn  internal  control  system  for  financial  reporting  continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are provided to ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial\n\nreporting is structured and uniform across the BASF/uni00A0Group. They also work in accordance with the international risk management standard,  COSO  II  Enterprise  Risk  Management  -  Integrated Framework.\n\nMaterial risks for the BASF/uni00A0 Group regarding a reliable control environment for proper financial reporting are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.\n\nMoreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that are material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF/uni00A0 Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. Persons responsible for implementing the requirements for an effective control system in financial reporting are appointed at the relevant companies.\n\nThe process for identifying, evaluating, managing and controlling risks related to preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as well  as  monitoring  these  processes  in  the  selected  companies comprises the following steps:\n\n## -Evaluation of the control environment\n\nAdherence to internal and external guidelines that are relevant to the maintenance of a reliable control environment is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire.\n\n## -Identification and documentation of control activities\n\n- In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes\n\nlisted in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control\n\n- activities are documented.\n\n## -Assessment of control activities\n\nAfter documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks. In the subsequent test phase, spot checks are carried out to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and effective.\n\n## -Monitoring of control weaknesses\n\nThe responsible leaders receive reports on any control weaknesses identified and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance to the BASF/uni00A0Group. The\n\nBoard  of  Executive  Directors  and  the  Audit  Committee  are informed if control weaknesses with a considerable impact on financial reporting are identified. Only after material control weaknesses  have  been  resolved  does  the  company's  managing director confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\n## -Internal confirmation of the internal control system\n\nAll managing directors and chief financial officers of each consolidated Group company must confirm to the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE every half-year and at the end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.\n\n## Operational opportunities and risks\n\n## Market growth\n\nThe development of our sales markets is one of the strongest sources of opportunities and risks. For more details on our assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global economy, regions  and  key  customer  industries,  such  as  the  chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, see Economic Environment in 2023 on pages 151 to 154.\n\nWe also consider opportunities and risks caused by deviations in assumptions. Macroeconomic opportunities arise from an easing of geopolitical conflicts and the resulting reduction in bottlenecks in the supply of energy, industrial raw materials and other intermediate goods.  The  complete  reversal  of  restrictions  to  contain  the coronavirus pandemic in China and the rapid opening up of the country may also boost global demand more than assumed in our baseline forecast.\n\nConversely, a significant macroeconomic risk arises from prolonged lockdowns  again  being  imposed  to  contain  the  coronavirus, impacting global supply chains and supply and demand. Further increases in energy prices caused, for example, by the war in Ukraine, and the even higher inflation rates resulting from this for manufacturer and consumer prices also pose a risk to the economy. Additional  macroeconomic  risks  result  from  the  escalation  of",

        "page_content": "geopolitical conflicts and a further intensification of the trade conflict between the United States and China.\n\nWeather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our business, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\n## Margins\n\nOpportunities and risks for the BASF/uni00A0 Group primarily result from higher or lower margins in the Chemicals and Materials segments in particular. Further increases in energy and raw materials prices and raw  materials shortages for a number of products and value chains, mainly due to the war in Ukraine, could further increase pressure on margins. This would have a negative effect on our EBIT.\n\nThe year's average oil price for Brent crude was $101/uni00A0per barrel in 2022, compared with $71 per barrel in the previous year. For 2023, we anticipate an average oil price of $90/uni00A0per barrel.\n\nThere is high uncertainty, especially surrounding the development of gas prices and the availability of natural gas in Europe in particular. The overall assessment therefore does not include any opportunities and risks that could arise from the volatility of European gas prices (see 'Overall assessment').\n\n## Competition\n\nWe continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to remain competitive. We monitor the market and the competition, and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities and counter emerging risks with suitable measures. Aside from innovation, key components of our competitiveness are our ongoing cost management and continuous process optimization.\n\n## Regulation/policy\n\nRisks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, new trade sanctions, stricter emissions limits for plants, and stricter energy and chemicals legislation in the E.U.\n\nPolitical measures could also give rise to opportunities. For example, we view measures around the world to increase energy efficiency\n\nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a strategic opportunity for increased demand for products such as our insulation foams for buildings, catalysts, battery materials for electromobility, or our solutions for wind turbines.\n\n## Procurement\n\nWe minimize procurement risks through our broad portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of raw materials on spot markets. We avoid sourcing raw materials from a single supplier wherever possible by creating and leveraging competition. We continually  monitor  all  risks  on  the  procurement  markets,  for example, the risk of default by important business partners. We take measures to avoid risks or minimize their effects.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nWe address the risk of supply interruptions on the procurement and sales side caused, for example, by extreme weather conditions (such as high/low water levels on rivers, heat/cold waves and hurricanes), the frequency and intensity of which are increasing as a result of climate change, by switching to alternative transportation solutions and the possibility of falling back on other sites within our global Verbund.\n\n## Investments/production\n\nWe try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high technical standards and by continuously improving our plants. We reduce the effects of an unscheduled shutdown on the supply of intermediate and end products through diversification within our global production Verbund.\n\nIn the event of a production outage - caused by an accident, for example - our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the scope of impact. Every region has crisis management teams on a local  and regional level. They not only coordinate the necessary emergency  response  measures,  they  also  initiate  immediate measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations as quickly as possible.\n\nCrisis management also includes dealing with extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes (for example, at the sites on the Gulf of Mexico in Freeport, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana) or  significantly elevated water temperatures in rivers due to extended heat waves, which limit the available cooling capacity. Appropriate precautions are taken at the sites in the case of a potential change in risk associated with climate change. For example, due to an increase in heat waves, we have implemented several measures at the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and at the Geismar site in Louisiana in recent years to increase cooling capacity, such as expanding and optimizing the central recooling plants and optimizing cooling water flows.  These  optimization  measures  are  designed  to  prevent production outages due to extreme heat waves.\n\nShort-term risks from investments can result from, for example, technical malfunctions or schedule and budget overruns. We  counter these risks with stringent project management and  controlling.",

        "page_content": "## Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations\n\nWe constantly monitor the market in order to identify possible acquisition  targets  and  develop  our  portfolio  appropriately.  In addition, we collaborate with customers and partners to jointly develop new, competitive products and applications.\n\nAcquisitions and divestments entail both opportunities and risks. These arise in connection with the conclusion of a transaction, or it being completed earlier or later than expected. They relate to the regular earnings contributions gained or lost as well as the  realization of gains or losses from divestitures if these deviate from our planning assumptions.\n\nFor more information on opportunities and risks from agreed transactions, see page 40\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personnel\n\nDue to BASF's worldwide compensation principles, the  development of personnel expenses is partly dependent on the amount of variable compensation, which is linked to the company's success, among other factors. The correlation between variable compensation and the success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk. Another factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension obligations. Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a particular country can have an impact on the development of personnel expenses for the BASF/uni00A0 Group. For countries in which BASF  is  active,  we  therefore  constantly  monitor  the  relevant developments in order to identify potential risks at an early stage and enable suitable measures to be taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information technology\n\nBASF employs a large number of IT systems. We use tech nolo gies such as big data and the Internet of Things to develop new busi ness models, corporate concepts and strategies and to respond appropriately to changing customer behavior. The global cyber security team is tasked with protecting these IT systems and the data and business processes they handle. In a connected, everevolving world, the challenge of protecting BASF against attackers is becoming ever greater and more complex.\n\nThe threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology and have far more resources available. This development reflects the fact that internet-based cyberattacks are extremely lucrative: A  variety  of  vulnerabilities  in  software  and  hardware  products constantly provide new incentives to develop malware, and anonymization technologies make it almost impossible to trace and punish attacks.\n\nA successful attack can, for example, negatively affect plant availability, delivery quality or the accuracy of our financial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records or  customer  data,  competition-related  information  or  research results,  can  result  in  legal  consequences  or  jeopardize  our competitive position. This could also cause monetary losses, a potential loss of reputation and even a loss of customers' and partners' confidence in the security of our products and services.\n\nTo minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and systems to ensure IT availability and IT security. These include stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access protection, encryption systems, and integrated and standardized IT infrastructure and applications. The systems used for information security are constantly tested, continuously updated, and expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. IT-related risk management  is  conducted  using  Group-wide  regulations  for organization and application, as well as an internal control system based on these regulations.\n\nWe employ modern security concepts to keep pace with advanced attackers. These range from efficient detection and professional response to defense against attacks and minimizing their potential impact. Strong cyber security alliances are also crucial here. BASF works closely with security authorities and security associations, for example as a founding member of the German Cyber Security Organization (DCSO) and the Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics (CSSA) platform in Berlin, Germany.\n\nBASF has also established an information security management system and is internationally certified according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017.\n\n## Compliance/legal\n\nWe constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own analyses and  assessments of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in  individual cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is particularly based on estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range of possible claims. These estimates are the result of close cooperation  between  the  relevant  operating  and  service  units together with Corporate Legal and Corporate Finance. If sufficient probability of occurrence is identified, we recognize a provision for the proceeding concerned. Should a provision be unnecessary, we continue to assess whether these litigations nevertheless represent a risk for the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT as part of general risk  management.\n\nWe use our internal control system to limit risks from potential infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try to avoid patent and  licensing  disputes  whenever  possible  through  extensive clearance research. As part of our Group-wide Compliance  Program, our employees receive regular training.",

        "page_content": "## Tax\n\nThe recognized tax-related opportunities and risks only concern taxes that impact the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT in the short term. These arise when BASF has taken a position that differs from the opinion of a competent administrative authority. If a tax payment has already been  made  and  could  be  reclaimed,  we  present  this  as  an opportunity. If, on the other hand, a potential payment is  outstanding in accordance with the administrative opinion, this is a risk. We primarily  evaluate  opportunities  and  risks  with  regard  to  their probability of occurrence and, if necessary, set up a provision for the/uni00A0 relevant risk. If a provision is not necessary, we take this into account in determining EBIT-relevant risks for the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\nDetailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial risks. Among other things, they provide for the segregation of financial instrument trading and back office functions.\n\nWe  continuously  monitor  activities  in  countries  with  transfer restrictions as a part of risk management. This includes, for  example, regular  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  and  legal  environment, shareholders' equity and the business models of the operating units. The chief aim is the management of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Exchange rate volatility\n\nOur competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF's sales, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates. A full-year appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by $0.01 would increase the BASF/uni00A0Group's EBIT by around \u20ac30/uni00A0million, assuming other conditions remain the same. On the production side, we counter exchange rate risks by producing in the respective currency zones.\n\nFinancial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS/uni00A021 at the closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies into our financial foreign currency risk management. If necessary, we hedge these risks using  derivative instruments.\n\n## Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing market interest rates. These can cause a change in the fair value of fixedrate  instruments  and  fluctuations  in  the  interest  payments  for variable-rate  financial  instruments,  which  would  positively  or negatively affect earnings. To hedge these risks, we use interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives in individual  cases.\n\nIn addition to market interest rates, BASF's financing costs are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid. These are  mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness.\n\n## Risks from metal and raw materials trading\n\nSome of BASF's divisions are exposed to strong fluctuations in raw materials prices. BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge these market  price  risks.  In  addition,  BASF  holds  limited  unhedged precious metal and oil product positions for trading on its own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility. Adverse changes in market prices negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF. These risks are continuously  monitored by a central risk management system and limited by strict  guidelines.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nRisks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to extensive  liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit lines.\n\nIn the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against potential refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various financial markets.\n\n## Risk of asset losses\n\nWe limit country-specific risks with measures based on country ratings,  which  are  continuously  updated  to  reflect  changing environment conditions. We selectively use investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit risks for our financial investments by engaging in transactions only with banks with  good  credit  ratings  and  by  adhering  to  fixed  limits.  We continuously monitor creditworthiness and adjust limits accordingly. We  reduce  the  risk  of  default  on  receivables  by  continuously monitoring  the  creditworthiness  and  payment  behavior  of  our customers and by setting appropriate credit limits. Risks are also limited through the use of credit insurance and individual hedging strategies, such as guarantees. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the BASF/uni00A0 Group, there are no major concentrations of credit default risk.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment risks\n\nAsset impairment risk arises if the assumed interest rate in an impairment test increases, the predicted cash flows decline, or investment projects are suspended. We currently consider the risk of  further  impairment  for  assets  such  as  property,  plant  and equipment, goodwill, technologies and trademarks to be immaterial. This could change if European gas prices remain at a high level in the longer term.\n\nWe are resolutely pursuing our path to climate neutrality. This includes  the  construction of one of the world's largest heat pumps in   Ludwigshafen, Germany, the increased use of green electricity and investments in offshore wind energy. For this reason, current developments and measures relating to sustainability do not lead to fundamentally changed expectations with regard to useful lives or recoverability of our assets.\n\nClimate policies are also causing fundamental changes in the automotive industry, one of BASF's key customer industries. The transition to electromobility will have a long-term negative impact on the emissions catalyst business. This development was accounted for in the adjustment of the growth rate for the goodwill impairment test and did not lead to an impairment. Other BASF businesses will benefit from this transformation; for example, demand for innovative lightweight components and battery materials will grow.\n\n## Long-term incentive program for senior executives\n\nSince  2020,  BASF  has  offered  its  leaders  the  opportunity  to participate in a long-term incentive program (LTI program) in the form or a performance share plan. The LTI plan incentivizes the achievement  of  strategic  growth,  profitability  and  sustainability targets and takes into account the development of the BASF share price and the dividend. The need for provisions for this program varies according to assumptions on the degree of strategic target achievement, the development of the BASF share price and the dividend. This leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\nUntil 2020, BASF offered leaders the opportunity to participate in a share price-based compensation program. The need for provisions for this program varies according to the development of the BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals Index; this leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\n## Risks from pension obligations\n\nBASF grants most employees company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We predominantly finance company pension obligations externally through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF/uni00A0Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF/uni00A0 Pensionstreuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the United/uni00A0Kingdom and Switzerland. To address the risk of  underfunding due to market-related fluctuations in plan assets, we have  investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also simulated  regularly by means of portfolio analyses. Adjustments to the interest rates used  in  discounting  pension  obligations  leads  immediately  to changes in equity. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, BASF has, for a number of years now, offered its employees almost exclusively defined contribution plans for future years of service. Some of these contribution plans include minimum interest guarantees. If the pension fund cannot generate this, it must be provided by the employer. A sustained low interest rate environment could make it necessary to recognize pension obligations and plan assets for these plans as/uni00A0well.\n\n## Strategic opportunities and risks\n\n## Long-term demand development\n\nWe assume that growth in chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will be higher than that of the global gross domestic product over the next five years and about as strong as the five-year average prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Through our marketoriented and broad portfolio, which we will continue to strengthen in the years ahead, for example, through investments in new  production capacities, research and development activities or acquisitions, we aim to achieve volume growth that slightly exceeds this market growth.  Should  global  economic  growth  see  unexpected, considerable  deceleration,  for  example,  because  of  prolonged restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, an ongoing weak period in the emerging markets, protectionist tendencies,  geopolitical conflicts or bottlenecks in the energy markets leading to  permanently elevated energy prices (particularly for natural gas in Europe), the expected growth rates could prove too ambitious.\n\nMoreover, the ambitions of global climate policy and its implementation will significantly impact the structure of demand from our customer industries. This is shown by a comparison of a climate policy scenario (global warming of no more than two degrees celsius in 2100 compared with pre-industrial times) with an alternative scenario that allows for more warming. In an ambitious climate policy scenario, the structure of demand changes due to the use of alternative energy sources and raw materials, high investment in resource-conserving technologies, and changing customer preferences. By contrast, macroeconomic growth rates typically vary little compared with a scenario with a higher warming path.\n\nMarket  opportunities  in  such  a  scenario  include,  for  example, additives that make plastics easier to recycle, alternative surface coatings for wind and solar modules, stronger demand for insulation materials  for  buildings,  increased  electromobility  with  changed demand for plastics, insulation materials, coolants and battery materials, and more alternative proteins in agriculture. By contrast,",

Furthermore, we predict that many producers in countries rich in raw materials will expand their value chains in consumeroriented sectors. In addition, the proliferation of large-scale digital marketplaces for chemicals could impact existing customer and supplier relationships.\n\nWe expect a continuous rise in customer demand for sustainable solutions, for example, products with a low carbon footprint, made from recycled, circular, or bio-based raw materials that are biodegradable,  or  products  with  other  measurable  sustainability benefits. However, an increase in customer demand for sustainable solutions is also highly dependent on regulation. Companies with a proven track record of providing more sustainable solutions will be able to achieve higher growth and profitability as a result. The expansion of sharing economy business models could have a long-term impact on demand in individual customer industries. At the same time, higher demands on product features can also create opportunities for innovation. We are therefore addressing these topics in research and investment programs for the sustainable transformation of BASF.\n\nTo strengthen our competitiveness, we are continuously improving our  production  processes,  streamlining  our  administration  and simplifying workflows and processes. Our research and business focus is on highly innovative businesses and differentiation through sustainability advantages to make our customers and BASF more successful.\n\n## Regulation/policy\n\nWe expect continued regulatory and societal pressure to achieve climate-neutral  energy  production,  climate-neutral  energy  consumption, and a climate-neutral resource and raw material base. The political approaches to address these issues will vary greatly from region to region. However, particularly in Europe, we expect measures with a continuously high level of detailed regulation, including changes to chemical and industry-related regulations, that have the potential to significantly impact the competitiveness of BASF's operations and product portfolio as well as that of our customers.\n\nWe see the risk of the current geopolitical shift in balance of power leading to the establishment of uncoordinated or divergent global legislative standards and regulatory systems, not just in relation to chemicals or the regulatory framework for digitalization, but also to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. We also see risks, but also opportunities, in the setting of international standards for specific product categories or technologies.\n\nWe explain our strategy in meetings with political decision-makers and social stakeholders. In doing so, we also inform ourselves of the changes we must undergo and advocate for a favorable and stable regulatory framework at both the national and international levels. We consider BASF to be in a strong position to contribute solutions toward achieving U.N. development goals, particularly regarding climate neutrality, through new technologies, innovative products and processes and our broad product portfolio.\n\n## Innovation\n\nWe expect the trend toward increased sustainability requirements in our customer industries to continue. Our aim is to leverage the resulting opportunities in a growing market with even more sustainable innovations. The key areas are products with a lower carbon footprint or even a carbon footprint of net zero, circular economy solutions, and safe and sustainable products. To be successful in these fields, we have launched specific research and investment\n\nprograms for the sustainable transformation of BASF. Furthermore, in order to steer our innovation portfolio toward increased sustainability, we began applying the Sustainable Solution Steering method to the evaluation of innovation projects and integrated it at an early stage of our research and development processes.\n\nThere are technical and commercial risks of failure associated with every single research and development project. We also address this by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio as well as through professional, milestone-based project management.\n\nFurther risks may arise from increasing state protectionism and the demand for localization of intellectual property in order to achieve technological independence. Through our Know-how Verbund in research and development, we ensure that critical intellectual  property is generated and protected in countries with high  intellectual property standards.\n\nWe expect that the digital disruption of established processes will lead to a sharp increase in efficiency and effectiveness in some fields. BASF is therefore committed to taking a leading role in the digital transformation of the chemical industry. Possible applications of digital technologies and solutions are evaluated along the entire value chain and implemented throughout the company, for example, in  production,  logistics,  research  and  development,  business models and corporate governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 49 onward",

        "page_content": "## Procurement and supply chain\n\nSupply security for raw materials, energy and services is  increasingly affected by trade disputes, protectionism, sanctions and  geopolitical conflict.  As  far  as  the  current  energy  price  level  in  Europe  is concerned, we expect the supply situation to ease in the mid- to long  term.  Furthermore,  our  accelerated  transformation  toward renewable  energy  will  make  the  company  less  dependent  on fossil energy sources. In addition, supply chains are increasingly threatened by disruptions such as suppliers' production  bottlenecks, interrupted logistics chains, extreme weather events and longerlasting effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Climate change and extreme weather events are impacting the availability of renewable resources.\n\nTransportation  is  significantly  affected  by  structural  capacity constraints (for example, a lack of truck drivers, traffic jams due to inadequate logistics infrastructure, worker shortages at ports) and increased transportation costs.\n\nWe are seeing an ongoing expansion of the regulatory framework affecting us and our suppliers (for example, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act). Potential non-compliance by our suppliers may lead to a reduced supplier base. Moreover, the use of renew able energies  depends  largely  on  favorable  prices  and  framework conditions.\n\nAll risks are continuously analyzed and appropriate strategies and measures developed to avert risks or minimize the impact on BASF.\n\n## Investments/production/infrastructure\n\nWe expect growth in chemical production in emerging markets to remain above the global average in the years to come. This will create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local presence. In addition, regional value chains help mitigate risks from trade conflicts and barriers that pose a challenge to global markets and supply chains.\n\nDecisions on the type, scope and location of our investment  projects are made on the basis of established comprehensive assessment processes. They take into account long-term forecasts for the market, margin and cost development, and raw materials  availability, as well as country, currency, sustainability and technology risks. Opportunities and risks arise from potential deviations in actual developments  from  our assumptions. Mitigation plans are in place where risks are  substantial.\n\nInvestments in more sustainable technologies represent a long-term opportunity, even though they may not be competitive or profitable in the short term, depending on the market and the prevailing regulatory  framework.\n\nTo assess the changing risks for our sites from climate change, climate data based on the latest scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were compiled for our sites in cooperation with an external partner. This enables the sites to assess  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change  in  the  coming decades.  Here,  we  focus  on  a  climate  protection  scenario, supplemented by two scenarios with medium and high levels of global warming. 1 The most common potential impact is an increase in heat and drought. The sites are supported by this information in the development of their strategies.\n\nThe availability of our production plants and infrastructure can be negatively affected by system downtime, confidentiality breaches or manipulation of data in critical IT systems and applications. The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology and have far more resources available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our investment projects, see page 156\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The assessment model was based on the IPCC climate change scenario SSP1-2.6, supplemented by SSP2-4.5 (medium global warming scenario) and SSP5-8.5 (high global warming scenario).\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations\n\nIn the future, we will continue to expand and refine our portfolio through smaller, bolt-on acquisitions that promise above-average profitable  growth,  are  innovation-driven  or  offer  a  technological differentiation and help achieve a relevant market position, and make new, sustainable business models possible.\n\nThe evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role during the assessment of acquisition targets. A detailed analysis and quantification is conducted as part of due diligence. Examples of risks include increased staff turnover, delayed realization of synergies, or the assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantifiable in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not met, risks could arise, such as a need for impairment. Opportunities could also arise, for example, from additional synergies.  Furthermore, business  carve-outs  and  divestitures  play  a  key  role  in  the development and optimization of our portfolio. In this context, risks could  arise  as  a  result  of  potential  warranty  claims  or  other contractual obligations, such as long-term supply agreements.\n\nFor more information on our acquisitions and divestitures, see page 40\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personnel\n\nBASF anticipates growing challenges in attracting qualified employees in the medium and long term due to demographic change, especially in North America and Europe. As a result, there is an increased risk that job vacancies may not be filled or only after a delay. We address these risks with measures to integrate diversity, employee and leadership development, and intensified employer branding.  At  local  level,  demographic  management  includes succession  planning,  knowledge  management  and  offerings  to improve the balance between personal and professional life, and promote healthy living. This increases BASF's appeal as an  employer and retains our employees in the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual initiatives and our targets, see page/uni00A0101 onward",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nThe positive contributions and negative impacts of our business activities on sustainability topics along the value chain, and the impact of sustainability topics on our business were assessed in a new materiality analysis carried out in 2022. Opportunities and risks for our business activities that could arise from material  sustainability topics, or for sustainability topics that could arise from our business activities, can only rarely be measured in specific financial terms and mainly have a medium to long-term impact. We are already seizing business opportunities, for example, through products with specific sustainability attributes (such as raw materials based on biomass or/uni00A0 recycled content) or intensified customer relations based on common sustainability ambitions. Relevant  sustainability topics are systematically integrated into our strategic risk management.\n\nWe reduce potential risks in the areas of environmental protection, safety and security, health protection, product stewardship, compliance, supplier relationships and human rights (including labor, social and quality standards) by setting ourselves globally uniform requirements. These sometimes go beyond local legal requirements. Our globally applicable Code of Conduct defines a binding framework for the activities of all BASF employees, leaders and members of the Board of Executive Directors. To ensure compliance with our internal and external standards, we have global management systems in place and monitor their implementation internally by means such as global surveys and audits. These also cover human rights topics in line with statutory regulations such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Our measures are regularly reviewed and  adapted as necessary to ensure the protection of human rights in our value chains and consequently, the continuity of our business  relationships.\n\nExpectations of suppliers are laid down in our global Supplier Code of Conduct. We have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The monitoring systems are complemented by grievance mechanisms that are open to all stakeholders, such as our compliance hotlines.\n\nOngoing climate change also poses opportunities and risks for BASF. As an energy-intensive company, climate-related risks arise particularly  from  regulatory  changes,  such  as  in  carbon  prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation. In addition, BASF's emissions footprint and intensity could lead to a negative perception and reduced appeal among external stakeholders such as customers or investors. We counter these risks with our carbon management measures and by transparently disclosing our positions on and contributions to climate protection, for  example, in  the  form  of  political  demands  or  through  progress  in  the implementation  of  our  climate  strategy,  in  publicly  accessible sources such as this annual report or on the BASF website, and in direct dialog with external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, there are also opportunities. Our broad product portfolio includes solutions for the circular economy and  climate  protection  (such  as  insulation  foams  for  buildings, materials for electromobility and bio-based products). Increased social awareness offers additional market opportunities for these products. We are working with numerous scientific and public organizations and initiatives on solutions for sustainable agriculture that meet economic, environmental and social demands over the long term.\n\nOur decentralized specialists use a central decision tree to  document reportable sustainability risks within the meaning of section/uni00A0289b et seq. of the German Commercial Code. No reportable residual net risks within the meaning of section/uni00A0 289b et seq. of the German Commercial Code were identified for 2022.\n\n- For more information on sustainability management, see page 45 onward\n\nFor more information on energy and climate protection, see page 135 onward\n\nFor more information on opportunities and risks from energy policies, see page 161\n\n- For more information on our positions on and contributions to climate protection, see basf.com/climateprotection",

This includes its organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation and sustainability. It  fosters the confidence of our investors, the financial markets, our customers and other business partners, employees, other groups affiliated with our company (stakeholders) as well as the public in BASF.\n\nThe fundamental elements of BASF/uni00A0 SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier management system, with a transparent and effective  separation  of  company  management  and  supervision between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board;  the  equal  representation  of  shareholders  and  employee representatives on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of co-administration  and  supervision  at  the  Annual Shareholders'  Meeting.\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Responsible for company management and represents BASF/uni00A0SE in business with third parties\n- /uni25AA Sets goals and strategic direction\n- /uni25AA Strictly separate from the Supervisory Board\n\n## Direction and management by the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for managing the company and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third  parties.  BASF's  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is  strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive Directors' activities and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously\n\nbe a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its  individual business areas, including the sustainability strategy.  In  doing  so,  the  Board  ensures  that  the  risks  and opportunities associated with social and environmental factors for our company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF's activities are systematically identified and evaluated. In addition  to  long-term  economic  goals,  the  corporate  strategy appropriately  takes  environmental  and  social  objectives  into account,  too.  The  corporate  planning  defined  on  this  basis comprises financial and sustainability-related goals.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  determines  the company's internal organization and decides on the composition of management positions on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant  individual measures, and supervising operational management.\n\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the  company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value and developing the company over the long term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as economic targets. The Board's responsibilities include the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting. It must\n\nalso ensure that the company's activities comply with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives (compliance). This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management as well as embedding a company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\n\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made and all important matters of the company are discussed at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. The chair of the Board of Executive Directors leads the Board meetings. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote. However, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors'  majority vote. The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto. Outside  of  matters  that  are  assigned  to  the  entire  Board  for consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their designated areas of responsibility.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisition or divestiture projects or to prepare decisions to be",

For the preparation of important decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures, investments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board. Independently of the affected business area, these committees thoroughly assess the planned measures and evaluate the associated opportunities and risks. Based on this information, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk situation,  risk  management  and  compliance.  Furthermore,  the Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company's strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to obtain the Supervisory Board's approval prior to their conclusion. Such  cases  that  require  approval  include  the  acquisition  and disposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue of bonds or comparable financial instruments. However, this is only necessary if the acquisition or disposal price or the amount of the issue in an individual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the most recent approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\n- For more information on risk management, see the Forecast report from page 157 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas of responsibility and memberships in the supervisory bodies of other companies, are listed from page 182 onward.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors,\n- see basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Competence profile, diversity concept and succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe Supervisory Board works hand in hand with the Board of Executive Directors to ensure long-term succession planning for the composition of the Board of Executive Directors.

It is the/uni00A0task of the Board of Executive Directors to propose a sufficient number of suitable individuals to the Supervisory Board.\n\nBASF's long-term succession planning is guided by the corporate strategy. It is based on systematic management development characterized by the following:\n\n- - Early identification of suitable leaders of different professional backgrounds, nationalities and genders\n- - Systematic  development  of  leaders  through  the  successful assumption of tasks with increasing responsibility, where possible in different business areas, regions and functions\n- - Desire to shape strategic and operational decisions and proven success in doing so, as well as leadership skills, especially under challenging business conditions\n- - Role model function in putting corporate values into practice\n\nThe aim is to enable the Supervisory Board to ensure a reasonable level  of  diversity  with  respect  to  education  and  professional\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12/uni00A0members\n\n6 shareholder representatives elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and 6 employee representatives\n\nChair elected by the Supervisory Board\n\nexperience,  cultural  background,  international  representation, gender and age when appointing members of the Board of  Executive Directors. Irrespective of these individual criteria, a holistic approach will ultimately determine a person's suitability for appointment to the Board  of  Executive  Directors  of  BASF/uni00A0 SE.  Both  systematic succession planning and the selection process aim to ensure that the Board of Executive Directors as a whole has the following profile, which serves as a diversity concept:\n\n- - Many years of leadership experience in scientific, technical and commercial fields\n- - International experience based on background and/or  professional experience\n- - At least one female Board member\n- - A balanced age distribution to ensure the continuity of the Board's work and enable seamless succession planning\n\nThe  first  appointment  of  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive Directors is for a term of no more than three years.

        "page_content": "Supervisory Board determines the number of members on the Board  of  Executive  Directors.  It  is  guided  by  insights  gained by BASF as a company with an integrated leadership culture and is determined by the needs arising from cooperation within the Board of Executive Directors. The Supervisory Board considers six to be an appropriate number of Board members given the current  business composition, future responsibilities associated with  development and the fundamental organizational structure of the BASF/uni00A0Group.\n\nThe current composition of the Board of Executive Directors meets the competence profile and the requirements of the diversity  concept in full.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Appoints, monitors and advises Board of Executive Directors\n- /uni25AA Four Supervisory Board committees\n- /uni25AA Composition criteria: professional and personal qualifications, diversity, and independence\n\n## Supervision of company management by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of Executive  Directors  and  supervises  and  advises  the  Board  of Executive Directors on management issues. It must also be involved in making decisions that are of key importance for the company. This also includes the Board of Executive Directors' consideration of sustainability issues with regard to corporate governance. The Supervisory Board is also responsible for auditing BASF SE's and the Group's Annual Financial Statements. As members of the Supervisory Board may not simultaneously be on the Board of\n\nExecutive Directors, a high level of autonomy is already structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nIn addition to the SE Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is provided by the Statutes of BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the  Involvement of Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement). The latter  also  includes  the  regulations  applicable  to  BASF  for implementing the statutory gender quota for the Supervisory Board. The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF/uni00A0SE as a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE).\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0 SE comprises 12 members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at the Annual  Shareholders' Meeting via a simple majority. Six members are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (BASF Works Council Europe), the European employee representation body of the BASF/uni00A0Group. In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A018, 2020, the period of appointment for newly elected members of the Supervisory Board was reduced from five to four years; and the Statutes were amended accordingly. This ensures that the  maximum membership duration of 12/uni00A0years up to which a Supervisory Board member can be classified as independent corresponds to a total of three election terms in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nMeetings of the Supervisory Board and its four committees are called by their respective chairs and independently, at the request of one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors. The shareholder and employee representatives of the Supervisory Board prepare for Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a simple majority vote of the participating Supervisory Board members. In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair of the Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder  representative, shall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable\n\n- * Classified by the Supervisory Board as an 'independent' member of the Supervisory Board (see page 174 for the criteria used to determine independence)\n\nfor the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board. Resolutions can, as needed, also be made in writing or through  electronic  communication outside of the meetings, as long as no Supervisory Board member objects to this form of passing a resolution. The Supervisory Board meets regularly even without the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors regularly informs the Supervisory Board about matters such as the course of business and expected developments, the financial position and results of operations, corporate planning, the implementation of the corporate strategy, including  the  sustainability  strategy,  business  opportunities  and risks, as well as risk and compliance management. The Supervisory Board  has  embedded  the  main  reporting  requirements  in  an information policy. The chair of the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the Board of Executive Directors, especially with its chair, outside of meetings as well.\n\n- A list of the members of BASF SE's Supervisory Board indicating which members are shareholder or employee representatives and their appointments to the supervisory bodies of other companies can be found from page 183 onward.\n- Compensation of the Supervisory Board is described in the Compensation Report at basf.com/compensationreport\n- The Statutes of BASF/uni00A0SE and the Employee Participation Agreement can be found at basf.com/statutes and basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Personnel Committee\n\n## Members\n\nDr. Kurt Bock* (chair) Prof. Dr. Stefan Asenkerschbaumer* (since April 29, 2022) Franz Fehrenbach (until April 29, 2022) Sinischa Horvat* Michael Vassiliadis\n\n## Duties\n\n- - Prepares the appointment of members to the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board as well as the service  contracts",

The sustainability topic is of such pivotal importance to BASF with its economic success, environment and social-related aspects that the entire Supervisory Board regularly discusses it in detail as a cross-cutting issue. This also applies to the significant issue of  reducing CO2 emissions and the targeted conversion of business  activities  to  CO2-free  energy  supply  and  production processes with a  lower emission rate.\n\n## Meetings and meeting attendance\n\nIn the 2022 business year, meetings were held as follows:\n\n- - The Supervisory Board met five times.\n- - The Personnel Committee met four times.\n- - The Audit Committee met five times.\n- - The Nomination Committee did not meet.\n\nAll members attended all meetings of the Supervisory Board.

In December 2017, the Supervisory Board agreed for the first time on objectives for the composition, the competence profile and the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board. These objectives and the competence profile have since been continuously updated in the implementation of legal requirements and further developed, taking into  account  the  recommendations  of  the  German  Corporate Governance Code. The guiding principle for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to ensure qualified supervision and guidance for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE. For the election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, individuals shall be nominated to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting who can, based on their professional knowledge and experience, integrity, commitment, independence and character, successfully perform the work of a supervisory board member at an international  chemical company.\n\n- - The Strategy Committee did not meet.\n- * Classified by the Supervisory Board as an 'independent' member of the Supervisory Board (see page 174 for the criteria used to determine independence)\n\n## Competence profile\n\nThe following requirements and objectives (as amended in  December 2022) are considered essential to the composition of the  Supervisory Board as a collective body:\n\n- - Leadership experience in managing companies, associations and networks\n- - Members' collective knowledge of the chemical sector and the related value chains\n- - Appropriate knowledge within the body as a whole of finance, accounting,  financial  reporting,  risk  management,  law  and compliance\n- - Appropriate expertise within the body as a whole on sustainability issues that are of key importance for BASF\n- - At least one member with special knowledge and experience (special expertise) in accounting, including sustainability reporting\n- - At least one member with special knowledge and experience (special expertise) in the annual audit, including the audit of sustainability  reporting\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in innovation, research & development and technology\n- - At  least  one  member  with  in-depth  experience  in  the  areas of/uni00A0 digitalization, information technology, business models and start-ups\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience  in the areas of human resources, society, communications and the media\n- - Specialist knowledge and experience in sectors outside of the chemical industry\n\nThe  status  of  implementation  of  the  Supervisory  Board's  competence profile is shown in the following qualifications matrix on page/uni00A0174.\n\n- For more information on the Supervisory Board's competence profile, see basf.com/competence-profile/supervisoryboard",

experience in auditing, including sustainability auditing\n- b Member with special knowledge of and experience in accounting and reporting, including sustainability reporting\n\n## Diversity concept\n\nThe Supervisory Board strives to achieve a reasonable level of diversity with respect to character, gender, international representation, professional background,  specialist knowledge  and experience  as  well  as  age  distribution.  It  takes  the  following composition criteria into account:\n\n- - At least 30% women and 30% men\n- - At least 30% of members have international experience based on their background or professional experience\n- - At least 50% of members have different educational backgrounds and professional experience\n- - At least 30% under the age of 60\n\n## Further composition objectives\n\n- -Character and integrity: Members of the Supervisory Board must  be  personally  reliable  and  have  the  knowledge  and\n\nFinance,\n\nexperience required to diligently and independently perform the work of a supervisory board member.\n\n- -Availability: Each member of the Supervisory Board ensures that they invest the time needed to properly perform their role as a member of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE. The statutory limits on appointments and the recommendations of the German Corporate  Governance  Code  must  be  complied  with  when accepting further appointments.\n- -Age  limit  and  period  of  membership: Persons  who  have reached the age of 72 on the day of election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting should generally not be nominated for election. Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally not  exceed  three  regular  statutory  periods  in  office,  which corresponds to 12/uni00A0years.\n\n-\n\n- Independence: To  ensure  the  independent  monitoring  and consultation of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board  should  have  an  appropriate  number  of  independent members on the board as a whole and an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. The Supervisory Board deems this to be the case if more than half of the shareholder representatives and at least eight members of the Supervisory Board  as  a  whole  can  be  considered  independent.  The Supervisory Board's assessment of independence is based on the assessment criteria in the current respective version of the German Corporate Governance Code.  Among other things, this means that members of the Supervisory Board are no longer considered independent if they have been a member of the board for 12 years or longer. The Supervisory Board has additionally defined  the  following  principles  to  clarify  the  meaning  of independence: The independence of employee representatives is not compromised by their role as an employee representative or employment by BASF/uni00A0SE or a Group company.

        "page_content": "of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF/uni00A0SE does not preclude independence following the expiry of the statutory cooling-off period of two years. Material transactions between a Supervisory Board member or a related party or  undertaking of the  Supervisory Board member on the one hand, and BASF/uni00A0SE or a BASF/uni00A0Group company on the other, exclude a member of the Supervisory Board from being qualified as independent. A material transaction is defined as one or more transactions in a single calendar year with a total volume of 1% or more of the sales of the companies involved in each case. In the same way, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party or undertaking of a Supervisory Board member has a personal service or consulting agreement with BASF SE or one of its Group companies with an annual compensation of over 50% of the Supervisory Board compensation, they do not qualify as independent. Furthermore, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory Board member holds more than 20% of the shares in a company in which BASF/uni00A0 SE is indirectly or directly the majority shareholder, the necessary independence is also not met.\n\n## Status of implementation\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's own assessment, its current composition meets all of the requirements of the competence profile: 11 of the 12 current members, of which six are shareholder representatives and five are employee representatives, are considered independent based on the above criteria.\n\nOnly the employee representative Michael Vassiliadis is no longer considered independent as he has been a member of the Supervisory Board since August 2004, and therefore for over 12 years.\n\n- For more information on the statutory minimum quotas for the number of women and men on the Supervisory Board, see the section on this page 'Commitments to promote the participation of  women in leadership positions at BASF/uni00A0SE'\n\nThe independent Supervisory Board members are named under Management and Supervisory Boards from page 183 onward.\n\n## Compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Compensation Report in accordance with section/uni00A0162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the assurance statement of the substantive and formal audit issued by the auditor, the effective compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section/uni00A087a AktG, as well as the most recent resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the compensation of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section/uni00A0 113(3) AktG have been made publicly available on the BASF website at basf.com/compensationreport.\n\n## Commitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF/uni00A0SE\n\nThe supervisory board of a publicly listed European stock  corporation (SE) that is composed of the same number of shareholder and employee representatives must, according to section/uni00A017(2) of the SE Implementation Act, consist of at least 30% women and 30% men. Since the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0SE comprises four women, of whom two are shareholder representatives and two are employee representatives, and eight men. The Supervisory Board's composition meets the  statutory requirements.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Act to Supplement and Amend the Regulations on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sector (F\u00fcPoG) on August/uni00A0 12, 2021, if the management board of a listed company consists of more than three persons, at least one woman and one man must be members of the management board (section/uni00A076 (3a) AktG). BASF met this requirement in the reporting year. There have been two female Board members since the appointment of Dr./uni00A0 Melanie Maas-Brunner to the Board of Executive Directors, effective as of February/uni00A01, 2021. With six members of the Board of/uni00A0 Executive Directors, this corresponds to a 33.3 percentage of women.\n\nIn compliance with legal requirements of the F\u00fcPoG, the Board of Executive Directors decided on target figures for the proportion of women at the two management levels below the Board of Execu tive Directors of BASF SE. For the target-attainment period from January/uni00A01, 2022, to December/uni00A031, 2026, the Board of Executive  Directors resolved as targets the quotas achieved as of December/uni00A031, 2021: 20.0%  for  the  proportion  of  women  in  the  management  level directly below the Board and 23.2% for the level below that.\n\nBASF views the further development and promotion of women as a global duty independent of individual Group companies. For this purpose, it has committed to ambitious targets on a worldwide scale. The new target is to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions worldwide to 30% by 2030. BASF will continue to work systematically on expanding the percentage of women in its leadership team. To achieve this, global measures will be implemented and enhanced continuously.\n\n- For more information on the percentage of women in leadership positions in the BASF/uni00A0Group worldwide, as well as the inclusion of diversity, including the promotion of women, see the section in the Management's Report under Employees on page 107 onward\n- The Employee Participation Agreement relevant to the composition of the Supervisory Board in the version dated November 2015 is available at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Shareholders' rights\n\n## At a glance\n\n- /uni25AA Shareholders exercise rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n- /uni25AA One share, one vote\n\nShareholders exercise their rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which usually takes place within the first five months of the business year.

Voting rights can be exercised according to shareholders' instructions by company-appointed proxies until the beginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully implemented the principle of 'one share, one vote.' All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, to have their say concerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to contest resolutions of the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court. Shareholders who hold at least \u20ac500,000 of the company's share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nGiven the particular circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting was again held as a virtual event without the physical presence of shareholders in accordance\n\nwith the specific legal framework of the statutory provisions on the/uni00A0 holding of a virtual Annual Shareholders' Meeting pursuant to Article/uni00A0 2 Section 1(1) and (2) of the COVID-19 Act in the version amended by the Gesetz zur weiteren Verk\u00fcrzung des Restschuldbefreiungsverfahrens und  zur  Anpassung  pandemiebedingter Vorschriften  im  Gesellschafts-,  Genossenschafts-,  Vereins-  und Stiftungsrecht sowie im Miet- und Pachtrecht ['Act to further  shorten the residual debt discharge process and to adapt pandemic- related provisions in corporate, cooperative, association and foundation legislation as well as in tenancy and lease legislation'] of December/uni00A022, 2020. To ensure legally compliant execution of this special Annual   Shareholders'  Meeting  format,  whereby  shareholders par tici pated  solely  via  electronic  communication,  some  of  the aforementioned  shareholder  rights  and  options  for  action  were limited or handled in an exceptional manner at this virtual meeting. In  contrast, the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting is planned to be/uni00A0 held again as an in-person meeting, i.e., with the shareholders physically  present at the meeting venue.\n\n## Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\n\nBASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company. BASF/uni00A0SE follows all of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April/uni00A028, 2022 (Code 2022), the version in force at the time of submitting the Declaration of Conformity on December 15, 2022. Until then, BASF has complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated December/uni00A0 16, 2019 (Code 2020). In the same manner, BASF follows all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n- The joint Declaration of Conformity 2022 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of BASF/uni00A0SE is rendered on page 193\n- For more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2022, the implementation of the Code's suggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\nDisclosures according to section/uni00A0315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report of the Board of Executive Directors according to section/uni00A0176(1) sentence/uni00A01 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\n## Share capital and shares\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2022, BASF SE's subscribed capital was \u20ac1,144,134,309.12 after the redemption of 24,623,765 repurchased own company shares in December 2022 (December 31, 2021: \u20ac1,175,652,728.23), divided into 893,854,929 registered shares with no par value (December/uni00A031, 2021: 918,478,694). Each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the  Statutes, shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates (issuance of share certificates). There are neither different classes of shares nor shares with preferential voting rights.\n\n## Appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive  Directors\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article/uni00A039 of the SE Council Regulation, section/uni00A016 of the SE Implementation Act and sections/uni00A084 and 85 AktG as well as Article/uni00A07 of the Statutes of BASF/uni00A0 SE.  Accordingly,  the  Supervisory  Board  determines  the number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors, and can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs. The members of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is three  years.  Reappointments  are  permissible.  The  Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and dismissals according to its own best judgment.",

        "page_content": "## Amendments to the Statutes\n\nAccording to Article/uni00A059(1) of the SE Council Regulation,  amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted with at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to the Statutes, section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve on amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the redemption of repurchased BASF shares and after an issue of shares from authorized capital.\n\n## Authorized capital\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A0 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions, the company's share capital by a total of up to \u20ac470 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind (authorized capital). A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to shareholders. This can also be achieved by a credit institution acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer these to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 10% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Article/uni00A0 5(8) of the BASF/uni00A0SE Statutes. This applies in particular if, for capital increases in return for cash contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of shares issued under this authorization does not exceed 10% of the shares currently in issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or shares in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF shares.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing up to 91,847,800 new shares. The contingent capital increase serves to grant shares to the holders of convertible bonds or warrants attached to bonds with warrants of BASF SE or a subsidiary, which the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to issue up to April/uni00A028, 2027, by way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022. A right to  subscribe to the bonds shall be granted to shareholders. The Board of Executive  Directors  is  authorized  to  exclude  the  share holders' subscription right in certain exceptional cases - as defined in Article/uni00A05(9) of the BASF/uni00A0SE Statutes.\n\n## Authorization of share buybacks\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the shares in issue at the time of the resolution (10% of the company's share capital) until April 28, 2027. At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the shares can be bought back via the stock exchange, via a public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders, via a public request to shareholders for the submission of offers to sell or by other means in accordance with section/uni00A053a AktG. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased company shares again (a) on a stock exchange, (b) through an offer directed to all shareholders, (c) with approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties by means other than via the stock exchange or through an offer addressed to all shareholders in return for cash payment at a price that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price of a BASF share at the time of the sale, or (d) with approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or shares in companies (including increases in shareholdings) or within the scope of corporate mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders' subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to retire the shares bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the retired shares.\n\n## Share buyback program 2022/2023\n\nOn  January/uni00A0 4,  2022,  BASF/uni00A0 SE's  Board  of  Executive  Directors resolved on a share buyback program with a volume of up to \u20ac3/uni00A0billion and with the company's own shares to be repurchased in the period from January 2022 until the end of 2023 (share buyback program).  Based  on  the  authorizations  granted  by  the  Annual Shareholders' Meetings on May 12, 2017 and April 29, 2022, altogether 24,623,765 treasury shares were acquired in the period from January 11, 2022 to November 30, 2022 in connection with the share buyback program. The purchase price for these own shares, including compensation payments to the respective banks, totaled  \u20ac1,325,486,177.80.  All  own  shares  repurchased  in connection with this share buyback program in 2022 were canceled, and the company's share capital was reduced pro rata by the amount attributable to the canceled shares. No own shares were acquired in December 2022 due to the intended redemption of shares.\n\n## Rights during a change of control\n\nBonds issued by BASF/uni00A0SE and its subsidiaries grant the bearer the right to request early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if, after the date of issue of the bond, one person - or several persons acting together - hold or acquire a volume of BASF/uni00A0SE shares that corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of control), and one of the rating agencies named in the bond's terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF/uni00A0SE or the bond, or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120 days of the change of control event.\n\nAn  exceptional  change  of  control  compensation  awarded  to outgoing members of the Board of Executive Directors has not existed since January/uni00A01, 2020, as of the introduction of the  amended compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors, which was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A018, 2020.  The  general  rule  for  severance  payments  granted  for premature terminations of appointments to the Board of Executive Directors  applies,  which  states  that  the  maximum  severance payment may not exceed the amount of two years' compensation;",

        "page_content": "however, this may not exceed the compensation for the remaining period of the contract.\n\nBy contrast, employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classified as senior executives will still receive a severance payment if  their  contract  of  employment  is  terminated  by  BASF  within 18/uni00A0months of a change of control event, provided the employee has not given cause for the termination. The employee whose service contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of 1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on the number of months that have passed since the change of control event. A change of control is assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25% of the BASF shares or the increase of such a holding. The remaining specifications stipulated in section 315a HGB refer to situations that are not applicable to BASF/uni00A0SE.\n\n- For more information on bonds issued by BASF/uni00A0SE, see basf.com/bonds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance\n\nBASF SE has taken out liability insurance that covers the activities of members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board (directors' and officers' liability insurance). This insurance policy provides for the level of deductibles of 10% of damages up to 1.5 times the fixed annual compensation for the Board of Executive Directors as prescribed by section 93(2) sentence 3 AktG.\n\n## Share ownership by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nNo member of the Board of Executive Directors or the Supervisory Board owns shares in BASF/uni00A0 SE and related options or other derivatives that account for 1% or more of the share capital. Furthermore, the total volume of BASF/uni00A0 SE shares and related financial instruments held by all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board accounts for less than 1% of the shares issued by the company.\n\n## Share dealings of the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board\n\n(Obligatory reportable and publishable directors' dealings under Article 19(1) of the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 (MAR))\n\nAs legally stipulated by Article 19(1) MAR, all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board as well as certain members of their families are required to disclose the purchase or sale of financial instruments of BASF/uni00A0 SE (for example, shares, bonds, options, forward contracts, swaps) to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and to the company if transactions within the  calendar year exceed the threshold of \u20ac20,000. In 2022, a total of 20/uni00A0 purchases by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the  Supervisory Board and members of their families subject to  disclosure  were reported as directors' dealings, involving between 2 and 2,618/uni00A0BASF shares or BASF ADRs (American Depositary  Receipts). The price per share was between \u20ac47.50 and \u20ac57.85. The volume of the individual transactions was between \u20ac105.45 and \u20ac124,987.51. The disclosed securities transactions are published on BASF SE's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on securities transactions reported in 2022, see basf.com/en/directorsdealings\n\n## Information on the auditor\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A0 29, 2022, once again elected KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft as the auditor of the BASF/uni00A0Group Consolidated Financial Statements and Separate Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0SE for the 2022 business year, as well as the corresponding Management's Reports. KPMG member firms also audit the majority of BASF Group companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. KPMG has been the continuous auditor of BASF SE since the 2006 Financial Statements. A public call to tender was issued in 2015 to all auditors for the audit of the 2016 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, in line with the E.U. Regulation 537/2014 of April 16, 2014 (E.U. Statutory Audit Regulation). Based on the results of the tendering process, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that it once\n\nagain propose KPMG for election. Owing to the German Financial Market  Integrity  Strengthening  Act  (FISG),  KPMG  can  only  be proposed for election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as BASF's  auditor  without  further  tendering  processes  up  to  and including the 2023 business year. Dr. Axel Th\u00fcmler has been the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements since auditing the 2022 Financial Statements. Since the 2020 Financial Statements,  the  auditor  responsible  for  the  Separate  Financial Statements has been Dr./uni00A0 Stephan Kaiser. The total fee paid to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and other BASF Group  companies for non-audit services, in addition to the auditing fee, was \u20ac0.9/uni00A0million in 2022. This represents around 4.0% of the fees for auditing the financial statements.\n\nDuring its meeting on October 20, 2022, BASF SE's Supervisory Board, acting on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and/uni00A0 after conducting a tendering process in line with the E.U. Statutory  Audit  Regulation,  resolved  to  propose  to  the/uni00A0 Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2024 that Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs gesellschaft be elected as auditor for BASF/uni00A0 SE's Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2024 business year. For the audit of the Annual Financial Statements and  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  2023,  the  Super visory Board intends to propose the current auditor KPMG/uni00A0AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft to be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2023 for the last time. It is legally required to change the auditor starting from the 2024 business year as KPMG will reach the maximum period for annual audits shortened by the Financial  Market Integrity Strengthening Act when auditing the 2023 Financial Statements. The decision was preceded by a public and discriminationfree tendering process for the selection of a new auditor in line with the relevant provisions of the E.U. Statutory Audit Regulation. The selection process was conducted at an early stage in order to give the new auditor enough time to complete non-auditing services, in this way ensuring its independence and a seamless transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and  expectations around how all BASF employees interact with business partners, officials, coworkers and the community. At the core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct . All employees and leaders are obligated to adhere to its guidelines, which cover topics ranging from corruption and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.\n\nThe online version of our Code of Conduct is aimed at our  employees and also offers user-friendly features such as case studies, FAQs and additional references.

This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in securing our company's long-term success. Our efforts are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\n\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance  violations,  including  corruption  risks.  These  are conducted at divisional and Group company level. The regular\n\ncompliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report. The same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\n\nOne key element in violation prevention is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame to take part in basic training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust  legislation,  taxes  or  trade  control  regulations.  Newly appointed senior executives also receive special training on leading with integrity. Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into account the specific risks of individual target groups and business areas. In total, more than 30,000/uni00A0participants worldwide received over 50,000 hours of compliance training in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Compliance culture at BASF\n\nFor corporate compliance to be a success, there must be an active culture of living these values and commitments within the company. The principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established and recognized in our day-to-day business. We expect all employees to act in line with these principles. Our leaders play a key role here/uni00A0they serve as an example of and communicate our values and culture both internally and externally. That is why special workshops on integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2022 for newly appointed senior executives.\n\n## Monitoring adherence to our compliance principles\n\nBASF's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the further development of our global compliance organization and our Compliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this task  by  the  Corporate  Compliance  department  and  more  than 100/uni00A0compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as well as in the divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center. Material compliance topics are regularly discussed in the  compliance committees established at global and regional level. The compliance organization reports to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the status of the  Compliance Program as well as any major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly seek  guidance  if  in  doubt.  They  can  consult  their  supervisors, specialist departments, such as the Legal department, and  company compliance officers. The internal platform and the corresponding app  also  help  employees  to  access  advice  by  enabling  direct contact. In addition, our employees can contact our compliance hotline - including anonymously - to report potential violations of laws or company guidelines. An independent external company has been contracted to manage this global hotline so that reported\n\ncases are recorded and processed worldwide through one system. The central point of contact is a website that informs all employees worldwide about the hotline and the grievance procedure in their national language. In addition to local phone numbers, the website also offers an online contact option, which is available via PC or smartphone. The website is also available to the public. Each concern is documented according to specific criteria, properly investigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered as quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as any measures taken are documented accordingly and included in internal reports.\n\nIn 2022, 453/uni00A0reports were received by our external hotlines (2021: 277). The information received related to all categories of our Code of Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling of company property and environmental, health and safety issues. We carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that came to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures on a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved control mechanisms, additional informational and training measures, clarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as well as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified cases related to violations of our principles on respect in the workplace and personal misconduct in connection with the protection of company property or inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests. In such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance with uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for  damages where there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2022, violations of our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total of 34 cases (2021:/uni00A0 32). This relates to diverse employee groups, including executives.\n\nBASF's Corporate  Audit  department monitors  adherence  to compliance  principles,  covering  all  areas  in  which  compliance violations could occur. They check that employees uphold regulations and make sure that the established processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2022, 47/uni00A0 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2021: 77). Our\n\ncompliance management system itself is also regularly audited by the internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in December 2022. Overall, the audit results speak for the effectiveness of the compliance manage ment system. As part of the comprehensive action plan developed last year for the continuous, systematic optimization of our compliance management system, we worked on strengthening key processes in 2022 and described the principles, core processes and roles in our system in detail in a revised internal policy, Compliance Management System (CMS), which was  approved by the Board of Executive Directors in August 2022. A particular focus of our compliance activities in 2022 was the further development of our internal systems and processes in light of/uni00A0changes to supply chain law, includ ing the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCA) (see page/uni00A0111).\n\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance risks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due Diligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based analysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are not prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a business relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with environmental, social and corporate governance standards, among other requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also check whether persons, companies or organizations appear on sanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there are business processes with business partners from or in countries under embargo. One focus of our activities in 2022 was on the continuous monitoring and implementation of the dynamically evolving sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine.\n\nWe support the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal guidelines  and  processes  in  keeping  with  these  principles.  For example, there is an internal guideline to respect international labor  and  social  standards that  is  applicable  throughout  the Group. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human rights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of  Transparency",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGRI 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF faced exceptional and unexpected challenges last year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine fundamentally and permanently changed the playing field for the European chemicals business, but especially for the shareholding in Wintershall Dea.\n\nAfter a good start to the business year, general economic uncertainty, concerns about the availability of key raw materials and extreme increases in energy prices all led to a disappointing sales and earnings performance in the second half of the year. Despite this, we still achieved the targeted operating result. A number of less energy-intensive businesses performed very well overall. The bottom line - income after taxes - was negative due to the necessary impairments on the shareholding in Wintershall Dea resulting from its de facto expropriation in Russia.\n\nAt its meetings, the Supervisory Board addressed in depth the impact of the turmoil on the raw materials and energy markets on the operational business and on the short and long-term competitiveness of important businesses and sites, as well as\n\ntheir value. The measures immediately taken by the Board of Executive Directors to reduce gas dependency and maintain Verbund production, especially at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, deserve special recognition. This includes public statements on the importance of a secure and competitive gas supply for the chemical industry as well as for Germany as a business location. Our discussions also focused on the further development of the BASF Group in light of increasing geopolitical risks,  changes in the regulatory environment and the path taken by the Board of Executive Directors toward climate neutrality. Last but not least, the foundation was laid for the further development of the Board of Executive Directors in terms of personnel.\n\nSeamless and solution-oriented collaboration between the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors is particularly important in challenging times. The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Board of Executive Directors for their extraordinary performance in light of the fundamentally new challenges. Our thanks also go out to our employees around the world for their impressive commitment in times of great uncertainty and insecurity.\n\nFor the Supervisory Board, 2022 was a year of change in personnel. Five new members  have joined since the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. This means that seven of the twelve members have joined the Supervisory Board since its regular election in 2019. The Supervisory Board meets all of the objectives it has set with regard to its composition and competencies.\n\nThe Supervisory Board welcomes the fact that the upcoming Annual Shareholders' Meeting can finally be held in person again. Especially in difficult times, direct dialog with you - our shareholders - is even more important than ever before.\n\n## Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of Executive  Directors\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost care. It regularly monitored the management of the Board of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company's strategic development and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, business developments including the major financial key performance indicators (KPIs) of the BASF Group and its  segments,",

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board tackled fundamental questions of  corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research and development. Regular topics of discussion were occupational and process safety, matters relating to sustainability, the environmental and social impact of the company's activities and the challenges of climate change for the future development of BASF's business. The Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports from the Board of Executive Directors and also deliberated on prospects for the company and its individual business areas with the Board of Executive Directors. It was convinced of the lawfulness, expediency and propriety of the Board of Executive Directors' company leadership.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors were also in regular contact outside of Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  was  always  promptly  and  comprehensively informed of current developments and significant individual issues. The Supervisory Board was involved at an early stage in decisions of major importance. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors which by law or the Statutes required the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five meetings in the 2022 business year, each of which was attended by all members. The meetings were held in person with the Supervisory Board members physically present. Two members of the Supervisory Board par ticipated in three of these meetings, and three members of the Supervisory Board participated in one meeting by means of electronic video communication. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the employees prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case, which were also attended by members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nAll members of the Board of Executive Directors attended the Supervisory Board meetings unless it was deemed appropriate that the Supervisory Board discuss individual topics - such as personnel matters relating to the Board of Executive Directors/uni00A0- without them being present. In addition, each Supervisory Board meeting\n\nincludes an agenda item that provides an opportunity for discussion without the Board of Executive Directors (executive session).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- An overview of the format of each meeting and members' personal attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees will be made available on the company website at basf.com/supervisoryboard/meetings\n\nA significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors' reports on the current business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings development, opportunities and risks for business development, the status of important investment projects (current and planned), important aspects of economic, environmental and social sustainability, developments in the regu latory environment, developments on the capital markets, significant managerial measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors, and innovation projects.\n\nIn all meetings held in 2022, the Supervisory Board also discussed the progress of major investments and ongoing portfolio projects, such as investments to establish a new Verbund site in southern China.\n\nAn important agenda item at all meetings of the Supervisory Board since March 2022 has been the impact of the war in Ukraine on the BASF Group's business activities. Strict compliance with the sanctions regulations of the European Union and other Western countries forms the basis for BASF's actions. The main focus of the Board of Executive Directors' reporting and the discussion in the Supervisory Board here was on the supply of natural gas, which is particularly critical for BASF's business, and the upturn in energy prices. The possible consequences for BASF's competitiveness in the short, medium and long term, particularly in Europe and at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, and the impact on Wintershall Dea AG's until now important business in gas production in Russia and in gas transportation, were discussed in depth, and the measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors were supported.\n\nAbout the meetings in detail: On February 23, 2022, the Supervisory Board reviewed the financial statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group for the 2021 business year that were submitted by the Board of Executive Directors, the corresponding management's reports, including the nonfinancial statements as well as the dividend proposal, and approved the financial statements. In preparation, the auditor had explained the process and results in detail the previous day and discussed them with the Supervisory Board.

Other topics  discussed at the meeting were the development of business, opportunities and  challenges in the Materials segment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met on April 28, 2022, one day before the virtual Annual Shareholders' Meeting, to prepare for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The  impact of the outbreak of war in Ukraine was also discussed.\n\nThe meeting on July 18/19, 2022, focused on the status of the implementation of/uni00A0BASF's corporate strategy and the further development of the BASF Group. Key individual topics here were:\n\n- - The implementation of BASF's corporate strategy, external challenges and measures to increase earnings\n- - The competitiveness of the Ludwigshafen site against a background of high energy prices and intensifying regulation\n- - The future development of the oil and gas business and the shareholding in Wintershall Dea AG\n- - The further development, opportunities and risks of the business in China; approval of the investment in a Verbund site in southern China\n- - The status, development and prospects of selected future business areas\n\nAt its meeting on October 20, 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed the com position of the Board of Executive Directors and passed a resolution to extend the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Martin  Bruderm\u00fcller, until the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2024 and to appoint Dr. Dirk Elvermann as the successor to Chief Financial Officer Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, who will retire at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 27, 2023. Other key topics included the tender for the auditor's mandate from the 2024 business year with the resolution to propose Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft as the future auditor to the Annual Share holders' Meeting 2024, as well as the implementation of the new recommendations of the amended German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAt its meeting on December 15, 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed and  approved the Board of Executive Directors' operational and financial planning, including the investment budget for 2023, and, as in previous years, authorized the Board of  Executive\n\nDirectors to procure the necessary financing in 2023 within a set limit. The Supervisory Board also addressed the topics of increasing the competitiveness of the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, expanding BASF's renewable energy portfolio in Europe, compliance management in the BASF Group and fulfilling due diligence obligations in supply chains.\n\n## Compensation and composition of the Board of Executive Directors\n\nIn several meetings over the 2022 business year, the Supervisory Board discussed and passed resolutions on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, two decisions on the composition of the Board of Executive Directors had to be taken.\n\nAt its meeting on February 23, 2022, the Supervisory Board deliberated and agreed on the 2022 targets for the Board of Executive Directors based on the preparations of the Personnel Committee. It also discussed and resolved on the final performance factors for the Board of Executive Directors' short-term and long-term incentives for 2021. At its meeting on October 20, 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed the appoint ment of a successor for the Chief Financial Officer Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, who will retire from the Board of Executive Directors as of April 27, 2023, and, in line with the recommendation made by the Personnel Committee, appointed Dr. Dirk  Elvermann as a member of the Board of Executive Directors from this date. Also following the recommendation by the Personnel Committee, it was resolved to extend the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, by one year until the end of the 2024 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. At its meeting on December 15, 2022, the Supervisory Board evaluated, based on the discussions and the corresponding recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Board of Executive Directors' performance in 2022 and set the performance factor for the short-term incentive 2022 and the strategic performance factors for the deferral compensation components for 2019-2022.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report, which has been made publicly available on the company's website at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF SE has four committees: 1. the committee for personnel matters of the Board of Executive Directors and the granting of loans in accordance with section 89(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel",

Following each Committee meeting, the chairs of the Committees  reported in detail about the meetings and the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has not established a special sustainability committee: In the Supervisory Board's opinion, sustainability is a material cross-cutting issue that affects all aspects of the Supervisory Board's supervision activities and is therefore considered in depth by the entire Supervisory Board. Sustainability expertise is broadly embedded in the Supervisory Board and has long been a very important requirement for its work.\n\n- For information on the composition of the committees and the tasks assigned to them by the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report from page 169 onward\n\nThe Personnel Committee met four times during the reporting period. All meetings were conducted in person. All committee members attended all meetings. At its meeting on February 22, 2022, the Personnel Committee discussed the target agreement for the Board of Executive Directors for 2022 and the targets for the long-term compensation to be granted in 2022 for the Board of Executive Directors for the period 2022-2025, as well as the 2021 Compensation Report. At its meeting on July/uni00A018, 2022, the Personnel Committee focused on the development of leadership at BASF's top levels of management below the Board of Executive Directors and long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors, including potential  successor candidates. A key topic here was the process for deciding on the successor for the Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, who will retire from the Board of Executive Directors at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 27, 2023. The main agenda item at the meeting on October 19, 2022, was the review of the appropriateness of the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors. For this purpose, the Personnel Committee had also obtained an appropriateness study from an independent external consultant, based on which the Personnel Committee currently does not see any need to adjust the compensation. The agenda also included the discussion of proposed resolutions for the Supervisory Board to extend the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, which ends with the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 27, 2023, and to appoint a new Board of Executive Directors member to succeed the departing Chief Financial Officer. At its meeting on December 14, 2022, the Personnel Committee discussed the assessment of the Board's performance in 2022, a proposal for the performance-related variable compensation and the further development of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times during the reporting period. Three meetings were conducted as in-person meetings and two meetings were conducted as video\n\nconferences. All committee members attended all meetings. Part of December's meeting was held without the Board of Executive Directors present (executive session). The Audit  Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed in section 107(3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German  Corporate Governance Code. The Audit Committee is also responsible for  monitoring  the  internal   process  for  identifying  related  party  transactions  and adopting resolutions to approve  related party transactions. The chair of the Audit Committee also maintains regular contact with the auditor between meetings, in particular regarding the  progress of the annual audit. During the Audit Committee meetings attended by the auditor, the Audit Committee also discusses matters with the auditor in a separate part of the meeting without a member of the Board of Executive Directors present.\n\nAt the meeting on February 22, 2022, the auditor reported in detail on its audits of BASF SE's Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2021 business year, including the corresponding management's reports, and discussed the results of its audit with the Audit Committee. The committee's audit also included the Non fi nancial Statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group, sustainability reporting as well as the Compensation Report of BASF SE in accordance with section 162 AktG, which had been audited by the external auditor. In preparation for the audit of the Non fi nancial Statements, the Audit Committee had, following a corresponding resolution by the/uni00A0 Supervisory Board, additionally engaged KPMG to perform a limited assurance and issue an assurance report on it. KPMG also reported in detail on the focus, the procedure and the key findings of this audit.\n\nAt its meeting on April 28, 2022, the Audit Committee addressed the BASF Group's quarterly statement for the first quarter of 2022, which was due for publication, risk management in the BASF Group, and the organization and results of further environmental, health and safety audits and controls.\n\nFocus topics at the meeting on July 22, 2022, were the BASF Group's Half-Year Financial Report and the internal audit system, on which the head of the Corporate Audit department reported.\n\nAt the meeting on July 22, 2022, the Audit Committee also engaged KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft - the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022 - with the audit for the 2022 reporting year and agreed upon the auditing fees. The focus areas and scope of the annual audit were discussed and defined together with the auditor.",

The head of the Corporate Compliance unit reported on compliance topics. In continuation of its consultations in previous meetings, the Audit Committee also addressed at length the tender for the audit of the Annual Financial Statements and the Consoli dated Financial Statements of BASF SE from the 2024 business year, discussed the results of the tender process and, based on this result, recommended that the Supervisory Board propose  to  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  that  Deloitte  GmbH  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft be appointed as auditor from the 2024 business year. The Audit Committee was regularly involved in the tender and application process through its chair. The meeting also addressed the Committee's annual self-assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of its work.\n\nAt the meeting on December 14, 2022, the auditors responsible reported on the status of the annual audit, as well as the focus areas of the audit and the most important individual items. This also included possible impairments on individual assets and the carrying amount of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea AG.\n\nAt all meetings, the Audit Committee addressed the main pending accounting issues and risks arising from litigation.\n\nThe Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing candidate proposals for the Supervisory Board members to be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board adopted by the Supervisory Board as well as the competence profile and diversity concept for the Supervisory Board. The Nomination Committee did not meet in 2022 as there were no further changes to the Supervisory Board members to be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting beyond the new appointments resolved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, which the Nomination Com mittee had already prepared intensively in 2021.\n\n- For the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the competence profile and diversity concept for the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 173\n\nThe Strategy Committee , which was established to discuss strategic options for the further development of the BASF Group, did not meet in 2022.\n\n## Corporate governance and Declaration of Conformity\n\nThe Supervisory Board places great value on ensuring good corporate governance: In 2022, it was therefore once again intensely occupied with the corporate governance standards practiced in the company and the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code, both in the version dated December 16, 2019, and in the amended version dated April 28, 2022 (GCGC 2022), which forms the basis for the forward-looking section of the company's Declaration of Conformity dated December 2022. Discussions concentrated on the implementation of the new recommendations of GCGC 2022 and its focus areas: integrating sustainability into company management and the Supervisory Board's supervision activities, the Audit Committee's special expertise in accounting and auditing, and cooperation with the auditor.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the guiding principles for the dialog between investors and German supervisory boards, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board again sought dialog with investors where appropriate in 2022.\n\nSpecial onboarding events were held for the new members of the Supervisory Board to familiarize them with the basics of corporate governance at BASF, the organization and internal structures of the BASF Group, and the composition of its businesses and their strategies. Above and beyond this, the company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training for their activities on the Super visory Board, whether through external offerings such as topic-specific seminars or  internal information offerings such as site and plant visits.\n\nAt its meeting of December 15, 2022, the Supervisory Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). BASF had complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019, until this date and has since complied with all of the recommendations of the GCGC 2022. The Corporate Governance Report provides extensive information on the BASF Group's corporate governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 193 and is available to shareholders on the company website\n\nat basf.com/en/corporategovernance",

        "page_content": "## Independence and efficiency review\n\nAn important aspect of good corporate governance is the independence of Supervisory Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest. The Supervisory Board based the assessment of the independence of its members on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the additional criteria for assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which were revised in the Supervisory Board meeting on December 19, 2019. The criteria used to assess independence are presented in the Corporate Governance Report on page 174. Based on these criteria, the Supervisory Board came to the conclusion that all of the six shareholder representatives and five of the six employee representatives - 11 of the 12 members of the Supervisory Board in total - are considered to be independent as of the end of 2022. Michael Vassiliadis was classified as non-independent due to the length of his membership on the Supervisory Board, which exceeds 12 years. Above and beyond this, the Supervisory Board does not see any indications that the Supervisory Board role is not performed completely independently. In cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence. The scope of these businesses is marginal and furthermore, they are conducted at arm's length.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the efficiency of its activities every year in the form of/uni00A0a self-assessment. To this end, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board again  conducted a written survey of all Supervisory Board members in the fourth quarter of 2022 on the basis of a detailed questionnaire covering the entire range of relevant Supervisory Board topics, supplemented by individual discussions. These included, in particular, the preparation and conduct of Supervisory Board meetings, the content and topics of the meetings, cooperation within the Supervisory Board and cooperation with the Board of Executive Directors and the auditor. The results of these dialogs, including suggestions to further improve the Supervisory Board's work, were presented by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on December/uni00A0 15, 2022, and thoroughly discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Overall, its members again rated the Supervisory Board's activity as efficient.\n\nIndependent of the efficiency review of the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee also conducted a self-assessment of its activities in 2022 based on individual discussions between the chair of the Audit Committee and all members of the Audit Committee. Material subjects were the organization and content of meetings, meeting documents and reports, participants and quality of discussions at meetings, and the\n\nimplementation of the recommendations of the 2021 efficiency review. The Audit Committee discussed the results of the questionnaire and detailed suggestions at its/uni00A0 meeting on October 19, 2022. On this basis, the members judged the Audit Committee's work to be efficient and appropriate.\n\n## Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements; Compensation Report\n\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for the 2022 reporting year, has audited the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and the additional requirements that must be applied in accordance with section 315e(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), including the Management's Report and the accounting records from which they were  prepared, and have approved them free of qualification. Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the measures incumbent on it under section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in an appropriate manner. In particular, it had instituted an appropriate early risk detection system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is suitable for the early identification of developments that could pose a risk to the continued existence of the BASF Group. The results of the audit as well as the procedure and material findings of the audit of the financial statements are presented in the Auditor's Report.\n\nThe Auditor's Report is rendered from page 197 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the auditor, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 178\n\nBeyond the statutory audit of the Financial Statements, KPMG also conducted, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, a limited assurance of the Nonfinancial Statements (NFSs) for BASF SE and the BASF Group, which are integral parts of the respective management's reports. On the basis of its audit, KPMG did not raise any objections to reporting and the satisfaction of the relevant statutory requirements. The auditor also audited the Compensation Report for the 2022 reporting year established in accordance with section/uni00A0162 AktG, including the related disclosures.\n\n- The assurance report issued by KPMG on the substantive audit of the NFS can be found at basf.com/nfs-audit-2022 The assurance report issued by KPMG on the audit of the Compensation Report can be found at basf.com/compensationreport\n\nThe auditor's reports were sent in a timely manner to every member of the Super visory Board.

The chair of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of the preliminary review at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 22, 2023. On this basis, the Supervisory Board examined the Financial Statements and Management's Report of BASF SE for 2022, the proposal by the Board of Executive Directors for the appropriation of profit, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Report for 2022. The results of the preliminary review by the Audit Committee and the results of the Supervisory Board's own examination fully concur with those of the audit. The Supervisory Board sees no grounds for objection to the management or the reports submitted.\n\nAt its accounts meeting on February 22, 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors, making the 2022 Financial Statements final.

Altogether, five Supervisory Board members stepped down at the end of the Annual Share holders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, two shareholder representatives and three employee representatives.  The  retired  shareholder  representatives  are  Anke  Sch\u00e4ferkordt and/uni00A0 Franz Fehrenbach, and the employee representatives are Denise Schellemans, Waldemar Helber and Roland Strasser. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, elected Alessandra Genco and Prof. Dr. Stefan Asenkerschbaumer to the Supervisory Board as new shareholder representatives. On the employee repre sen tative side,  Denise Schellemans and Waldemar Helber retired and were succeeded by Peter Zaman and Andr\u00e9 Matta, the substitute members elected by the competent election body in the 2019 Supervisory Board elections. The Ludwigshafen am Rhein District Court also appointed Natalie M\u00fchlenfeld as an employee representative on the Supervisory Board by court order dated April 12, 2022. The BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) confirmed the appointment as the competent election body for the employees by resolution dated June 23, 2022. The mandates of all newly appointed Supervisory Board members run until the end of the current Supervisory Board period, i.e., until the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2024. Following the new appointments, the Supervisory Board continues to consist of four women and eight/uni00A0men.\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's assessment, the current members meet in full the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board with respect to the competence profile and the diversity concept. This also applies to the expertise on the sustainability topics important to BASF, which the Supervisory Board has recently included in the competence profile as a further competence requirement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank its retired members/uni00A0- Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt, Franz Fehrenbach, Denise Schellemans, Waldemar Helber and Roland Strasser - for their dedicated and exceptionally competent service to BASF's Supervisory Board.\n\nLudwigshafen, February 22, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\nDr. Kurt Bock Chairman of the Supervisory Board",

In addition, we have audited the group management report of BASF/uni00A0SE for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the group management report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nThe group management report contains cross-references that are not required by law and which are marked as unaudited. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the cross-references and the information to which the cross-references refer.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -  the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well as the IFRSs in the version adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and the additional requirements of German\n- 1 This is a translation of the German original. Solely the original text in German language is authoritative.\n\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], and, in compliance with these  requirements,  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2022, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022, and\n\n- -  the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an  appropriate  view  of  the  Group's  position.  In  all  material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those components of the group management report specified in the 'Other Information' section of the auditor's report. The group management report contains cross-references that are not required by law and which are marked as unaudited. Our audit opinion does not extend to the cross-references and the information to which the crossreferences refer.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German pro fessional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied, please refer to Note 1.4 to the consolidated financial statements from page 212. The underlying assumptions used in the measurement and the disclosures on the impairment tests performed are included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements from page 242.\n\n## The financial statement risk\n\nIntangible  assets  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of BASF/uni00A0 SE include goodwill in the amount of EUR 7,696 million. Goodwill accounts for 9.1 % of total assets and thus has a material impact on the Parent Company's net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, irrespective of any indication of impairment. If any indications of impairment arise during the financial year, an ad hoc goodwill impairment test is also carried out during the year. The",

        "page_content": "goodwill impairment test involves the carrying amount being compared with the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher amount of fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the cash-generating unit.\n\nImpairment testing of goodwill is complex and based on a number of assumptions requiring judgment. These include the forecasts for future cash inflows in the detailed planning period, the assumed growth rate for subsequent periods and the cost of capital. These assumptions have a material impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The growth forecasts of the Board of Executive Directors are associated with risks and can be revised in light of volatile raw materials prices and an unstable macroeconomic environment.\n\nBased on the impairment tests conducted, the Company did not identify any need to recognize impairment losses. However, the Group's sensitivity analysis showed for the cash-generating units Catalysts (not including Battery Materials) and Surface Treatment in the  Surface  Technologies  segment  that  a  reasonably  possible change in the cost of capital, the EBITDA margin of the last detailed planning  year  or  the  long-term  growth  rate  would  reduce  the respective value to the recoverable amount.\n\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that any existing impairment as at the reporting date was not identified. In addition, there is a risk that the disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are not appropriate.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWith the involvement of our valuation specialists, we assessed, among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions as well as the Group's methods of calculation.\n\nWe examined the forecast for the expected business and earnings development and the resulting cash flows in the detailed planning period, in particular with respect to whether the expected development of the relevant sales markets was given appropriate consid era-\n\ntion and was consistent with the current budgets adopted by the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board. We compared  internal  growth  forecasts  with  industry  expectations  and those  of  significant  competitors  and  we  assessed  whether  the assumptions contained in the planning regarding the future development of margins and the amount of investments were appropriate. Our  review  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  budgets  adopted  by the/uni00A0 Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board also included a comparison of planning in past business years with the results actually achieved. For selected cash-generating units, we examined whether reasons for not reaching budgeted figures in the past were given appropriate consideration in current planning, to the extent that this was relevant.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the assumed growth rate for the period following the detailed planning period on the basis of industry- specific and macroeconomic studies. We evaluated the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted average cost of capital. To this end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions and data underlying the weighted cost of capital rates and compared these with the assumptions and data used.\n\nTo assess the methodically and mathematically correct implementation of the valuation method for the cash-generating units Catalysts (not  including  Battery  Materials)  and  Surface  Treatment  in  the Surface Technologies segment, we verified the Company's measurement using our own calculations and analyzed deviations.\n\nIn order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the/uni00A0 impact of potential changes in the cost of capital, the EBITDA margin of the last detailed planning year or the long-term growth rate on the recoverable amount by evaluating alternative scenarios as calculated by the Company (sensitivity analysis).\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are appropriate. This also included an assessment of the appropriateness of the disclosures pursuant to IAS 36.134(f) on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsensitivities in the event of a reasonably possible change in key assumptions underlying the evaluation.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe calculation method used for impairment testing of goodwill is appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be applied.\n\nThe assumptions and data of the Board of Executive Directors underlying the measurement are appropriate overall.\n\nThe disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are appropriate.\n\n## Recoverability of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied and the underlying assumptions used in the measurement, please refer to Note 10.2 to the consolidated financial statements from page 233.\n\n## The financial statement risk\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of BASF SE, shares in Wintershall Dea in the amount of EUR 4,364 million are reported under  non-integral  investments  accounted  for  using  the  equity method. The shareholding in Wintershall Dea accounts for 5.2 % of total assets and thus has a material influence on the Group's net assets.\n\nIf there are indicators for an impairment of an equity-accounted invest ment, the Company determines the recoverable amount as of the reporting date and compares this with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the investment. The higher value in use determined for the investment as recoverable amount is determined using the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount of the investment in the Wintershall Dea is complex and based on assumptions requiring judgment.  These  include,  in  particular,  the  distinction  between",

There is also the risk that the related disclosures in the notes are not appropriate.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Company's process for the identification of indications of impairment as well as for the determination of the recoverable amount based on explanations provided by the staff in accounting. In doing so, we assessed, among other things, whether the calculation of the recoverable amount of the invest ment  in  Wintershall  Dea  was  consistent  with  the  relevant accounting principles and whether the key assumptions made for this calculation were appropriate.\n\nTo assess whether the IFRS criteria for control or significant influence regarding Wintershall Dea's Russian investments have been fulfilled, we gained an understanding of the Russian government's decrees, inspected the correspondence with the co-owners and evaluated the accounting decision based on this at the level of Wintershall Dea.\n\nWe discussed the projected development of production volumes and oil and gas prices with the persons responsible for planning. We evaluated the production profiles used to measure the assets of the exploration  and  production  business  assets,  while  taking  into account assessments by experts contracted by Wintershall Dea. In order to assess its suitability as a basis for calculation, we had the oil and gas price scenario used by the Company explained to us. To assess its appropriateness, we compared the oil and gas price scenario used by BASF with the published expectations of com-\n\npetitors,  analysts,  international  institutions  and  other  market participants.\n\nWith the involvement of our valuation specialists, we also satisfied ourselves of the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted average cost of capital. We compared the assumptions and data underlying the capital costs, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor with our own assumptions and publicly available data.\n\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the measurement of the investment in Wintershall Dea, we verified selected calculations taking into account risk-based considerations.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes on the recoverability of the investment in Wintershall Dea are appropriate.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe underlying calculation method for the impairment test of the investment in Wintershall Dea is appropriate and consistent with the applicable accounting principles.\n\nThe Company's assumptions and data underlying the measurement are appropriate. The related disclosures in the notes are appropriate.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and/or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following components of the group management report, whose content was not audited:\n\n- -  the components of the integrated non-financial statement, which are marked as unaudited\n- -  the corporate governance statement included in the Corporate Governance section of the group management report, and\n- -  information extraneous to management reports and marked as unaudited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe other information also includes the remaining parts of the  annual report. The other information does not include the consolidated financial  statements,  the  group  management  report  information audited for content and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information  and,  in  so  doing,  to  consider  whether  the  other information\n\n- -  is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -  otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well as the IFRSs in the  version  adopted  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards Board and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such internal control as it has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.",

In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Board of Executive Directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors and related disclosures.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Executive Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inade quate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  financial  position  and  financial  performance  of  the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well/uni00A0 as the IFRSs in the version adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n- -  Evaluate  the  consistency  of  the  group  management  report with/uni00A0 the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- -  Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information pre   s ented by the Board of Executive Directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Board of Executive Directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assump tions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.",

In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group\n\nmanagement report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained in these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file made available, identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022 contained in the 'Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report' above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the file made available and identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)). Our  responsibility  in  accordance  therewith  is  further  described below. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management  1:  Requirements  for  Quality  Management  in  Audit  Firms (IDW/uni00A0QS 1).\n\nThe Company's Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the company's Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such internal control that they have considered necessary to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenable  the  preparation  of  ESEF  documents  that  are  free  from material  intentional  or  unintentional  non-compliance  with  the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- - Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- - Evaluate  the  technical  validity  of  the  ESEF  documents,  i.e. whether the file made available containing the ESEF documents meets  the  requirements  of  the  Delegated  Regulation  (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- - Evaluate  whether  the  ESEF  documents  provide  an  XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report.\n- - Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.",

Its official  address  is  Carl-Bosch-Str.  38,  67056  Ludwigshafen  am Rhein, Germany.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting principles\n\n## Accounting policies applied for the first time in 2022\n\nThe amendments shown in the table had no material effect on BASF/uni00A0SE's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF/uni00A0SE as of December/uni00A0 31, 2022, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and section/uni00A0 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). IFRSs are generally only applied after they have been endorsed by the European Union. For the 2022 fiscal year, all of the binding IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied. The Consolidated Financial Statements are for the period from January/uni00A0 1, 2022 to December/uni00A0 31, 2022, and are presented in euros. They are written in German and translated into English. All amounts, including the figures for previous years, are given in million euros unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, individual figures in this report may not add up to the totals shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown.\n\nThe individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business continuity is assumed. The accounting policies applied are largely the same as those used in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A01.3 from page 211 onward and Note/uni00A010 from page 231 onward\n\nOn February/uni00A021, 2023, the Board of Executive Directors prepared the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  submitted  them  to  the Supervisory Board for review and approval, and released them for publication.\n\n## Accounting policies applied for the first time in 2022\n\n| Standard/interpretation                 | Name of standard/interpretation   or amendments                                                                                                                     | Date of publication   | Date of endorsement  by the E.U.   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Amendments to IFRS 3                    | Business Combinations  (Amendment to References to the Conceptual Framework)                                                                                        | May/uni00A014, 2020   | June/uni00A028, 2021               |\n| Amendments to IAS 16                    | Property, Plant and Equipment (Proceeds before Intended Use)                                                                                                        | May/uni00A014, 2020   | June/uni00A028, 2021               |\n| Amendments to IAS 37                    | Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets   (Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract)                                                      | May/uni00A014, 2020   | June/uni00A028, 2021               |\n| Annual improvements to   IFRS 2018-2020 | Amendments to IFRS 1 (Subsidiary as a First-Time Adopter) IFRS 9 (Fees in the '10% Test' for Derecognition of   Financial   Liabilities) IFRS 16 (Lease Incentives) | May/uni00A014, 2020   | June/uni00A028, 2021               |",

The amendments to IAS/uni00A012, which serve  to  clarify  how  companies  account  for  deferred  taxes  on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations, are already being applied in BASF's financial statements. Transactions within the scope of application of IFRS 17 were identified for BASF to a minor extent only. The other amendments are also unlikely to have a material impact on the reporting of BASF and were not adopted  early.\n\n## IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered and not yet endorsed by the E.U.\n\nThe IASB issued further amendments  to  standards  and inter pretations which are still subject to E.U. endorsement and whose application is not yet mandatory.

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Group accounting principles\n\nScope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based on the application of the standards IFRS/uni00A010 and 11.\n\nAccording to IFRS/uni00A010, a group consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries  controlled  by  the  parent.  'Control'  of  an  investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three criteria:\n\n- - The  parent  company  holds  decision-making  power  over  the relevant activities of the investee\n- - The  parent  company  has  rights  to  variable  returns  from  the investee\n- - The parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns\n\nFulfillment of these three criteria is analyzed based on the corporate governance structure of the companies.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS/uni00A0 11,  which  regulates  the  accounting  of  joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of a legally independent company have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely transferred to the partners, through which the partners guarantee the joint arrangements' ongoing financing.\n\nCompanies whose corporate governance structures classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations in accordance with IFRS/uni00A011. Should the arrangement be structured through a separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements and all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.\n\nIn addition to BASF/uni00A0 SE, the Consolidated Financial Statements include  all  material  subsidiaries  on  a  fully  consolidated  and  all material joint operations on a proportionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of minor importance for the presentation of a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations, are not consolidated, but rather are reported under other shareholdings. These companies are carried at amortized cost and are written down in the case of an impairment. The aggregate assets and  equity of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at Group level.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the  equity  method  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Associated companies are entities that are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or joint operations, and over whose operating and financial policies  significant  influence  can  be  exercised.  In  general,  this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%. Associated companies and joint ventures that are fully or predominantly allocated to operating divisions are classified as integral because they are integrated into the value chain of the respective division; are controlled by the divisions; and they  generate their income in close cooperation with the other assets of the BASF Group and/or of these divisions. Equity-accounted income from integral joint ventures or associated companies is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT).\n\nEquity-accounted income from non-integral associated companies is reported in net income from shareholdings.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A010 from page 231 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsolidation  methods: Assets  and  liabilities  of  consolidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance with the principles described herein. For companies accounted for using  the  equity  method,  material  deviations  in  measurement resulting from the application of other accounting principles than those applied by BASF are  adjusted.\n\nTransactions between  consolidated  companies  as  well  as inter company  profits  resulting  from  trade  between  consolidated companies are eliminated in full. Sales and material other balances and transactions between joint operations and fully consolidated Group companies are also eliminated. Material intercompany profits related to companies accounted for using the equity method are eliminated.\n\nCapital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured at fair value regardless of the scope of any noncontrolling interests. Subsequently, the cost of acquiring the company is compared with the proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The resulting positive differences are capitalized as goodwill. Negative differences are reviewed once more, then recognized directly in the income statement.\n\nNoncontrolling interests are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition  proportional  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method).\n\nThe  incidental  acquisition  costs  of  a  business  combination  are recognized in the income statement under other operating  expenses.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A013 on page 241\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Foreign  currency  translation: The  cost  of  assets  acquired  in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the date the transaction is recognized. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Changes in assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency translation are recognized in the income statement and reported under other operating income or expenses, other financial result, and in the case of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in other comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation  of  foreign  currency  financial  statements: The translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the consolidated companies. For companies whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  euro,  translation  into  the reporting currency is based on the closing rate method: Balance sheet items are translated into euros using closing rates on the balance sheet date; expenses and income are translated into euros at  monthly  average  rates  and  accumulated  for  the  year.  The difference between a company's equity translated at historical rates at the time of acquisition or retention and its equity translated at closing rates on the  balance sheet date is reported under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in the income statement only upon the disposal of the company or a foreign  business.\n\nFor certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In such cases, financial statements prepared in the local currency are translated into the functional currency using the temporal method: All nonmonetary assets and related depreciation and amortization as well as equity are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  applying  to  the  respective transactions. All other balance sheet items are translated using closing rates on the balance sheet date; other expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates.

The fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets, are largely based on projected cash flows. Actual cash flows can deviate significantly from those. Independent external appraisals are typically used for the purchase price allocation of material business combinations. Valuations in the course of business combinations are based on existing information as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Groups of assets and liabilities held for sale (disposal groups):\n\nThese  comprise  those  assets  and  directly  associated  liabilities shown separately on the balance sheet whose sale in the context of a single transaction is highly probable. A transaction is assumed to be highly probable if there are no significant risks of completion of the transaction, which usually requires the conclusion of binding contracts. The assets and liabilities of disposal groups are recognized at the lower of the sum of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell; this does not apply to assets that do not fall under the valuation principles of IFRS/uni00A05. Depreciation of noncurrent assets and the use of the equity method are suspended.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A03 from page 216 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and other financial obligations reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of estimates, assumptions and discretionary scope. Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective  sections  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. They are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date and thus affect the amounts of income and expenses  shown  for  the  reporting  periods  presented.  These assumptions primarily relate to the determination of discounted cash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations;  the  useful  lives  of  depreciable  property,  plant  and equipment  and  intangible  assets;  the  carrying  amount  of shareholdings; and the measurement of provisions for items such as employee  benefits,  warranties,  trade  discounts,  environmental protection and  taxes.  Although  uncertainty  is  appropriately incorporated in the valuation factors, actual results can differ from these  estimates.  Furthermore,  extraordinary  challenges  resulting from  current  geopolitical  and  economic  developments  are  also considered.  The  war  in  Ukraine  has  significantly  changed  the economic environment in  Europe. In particular, reduced gas  supplies from Russia led to significantly higher prices in raw materials and energy and a high degree of insecurity regarding gas availability in general. The associated price increase in gas favors inflation and weakens the economy.  Current inflation developments were taken into account both in the measurement of pension provisions and other provisions as well as in the fixed asset impairment tests.\n\nImpairment  tests on  assets  are  carried  out  whenever  certain triggering events indicate potential impairment. External triggering events  include,  for  example,  changes  in  customer  industries, technologies  used  and  economic  downturns.  Internal  triggering events for an impairment test include lower product profitability, planned  restructuring  measures  or  physical  damage  to  assets. Impairment tests entail a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair\n\nvalue less costs to sell and the value in use. As a rule, value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The estimation of cash flows and the assumptions used consider all information available  on  the  respective  balance  sheet  date  on  the  future development of the operating business. Actual future developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cash-generating unit's long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on macroeconomic trends. In light of the war in Ukraine, appropriate consideration is being given to a scenario in which Russia permanently cuts off the gas supply which leads to negative impacts on production and sales planning as a result of considerable price increases on the energy and raw materials markets. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the capital asset pricing model plays an important role in impairment testing. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and an industry-specific spread for the credit risk. Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used. Fair value less costs to sell must be determined for the impairment test of disposal groups; specific assumptions relating to the respective transaction must be made for this determination.\n\nAn impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impaired asset (excluding goodwill) is written down by the amount of the difference between these amounts.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units. At BASF, these largely correspond to the business units, or in  individual cases the divisions. If there is a need for impairment, the existing goodwill is, if necessary, completely written off as a first step. If there is further need for impairment, this is allocated to the remaining assets  of  the  cash-generating  unit.  Goodwill  impairments  are reported under other operating expenses.\n\n- For more information, see Note/uni00A03 from page 216 onward and Note/uni00A014 from page 242 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate and sustainability-related developments: The chemical industry  is  resource-intensive.  BASF  is  committed  to  the  Paris Climate Agreement: Using resources as efficiently and responsibly as  possible  and  the  concept  of  a  circular  economy  are  firmly embedded in BASF's strategy and its actions. BASF pursues clearly defined goals to reduce CO2 as well regarding the use of renewable and recycled raw materials. In this context, BASF always strives to employ  raw  materials  more  efficiently  and  improve  production processes as well as to continually seek ways to use non-fossil, renewable  or  recycled  feedstocks.  Despite  the  current  global political situation, the path to climate neutrality is resolutely being pursued.  For  this  reason,  current  developments  and  measures relating  to  climate  change  and  sustainability  do  not  lead  to fundamentally changed expectations with regard to useful lives or recoverability of the majority of noncurrent assets. There is also no material need for adjustments to provisions for environmental and restoration obligations. In individual cases, however, plants may be shut down if necessary for reasons of environmental protection.\n\nClimate  policies  are  also  causing  fundamental  changes  in  the automotive industry, one of BASF's key customer industries. The transition to electromobility will have a long-term negative impact on the emissions catalyst business. This development is reflected in a negative long-term growth rate for the Catalysts (excluding battery materials) cash-generating unit. Other BASF businesses will benefit from  this  transformation;  for  example,  demand  for  innovative lightweight components and battery materials will grow. Furthermore, climate policies can influence the business of oil and gas producers such as Wintershall Dea, which BASF accounts for using the equity method. Nevertheless, given the large share of gas in Wintershall Dea's production and reserves as well as the acceptance of gas as a bridge technology, it can be assumed that these assets  are  fundamentally  recoverable.  The  price  assumptions applied  for  the  impairment  test  reflected  current  developments regarding climate neutrality as well as a possible oil and gas  shortage due to lack of investment in this industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on climate and sustainability, see Wintershall Dea's annual report at wintershalldea.com/en/investor-relations",

Through the resulting loss of control, the affiliated companies were eliminated from the scope of consolidation. Since then, the previously fully consolidated company HKZ Investor Holding B.V. has been consolidated as an integral joint venture using the equity method.\n\nBecause  of  increased  importance,  Lucura  Versicherungs  AG, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany, which was previously  accounted for as an integral associated company using the equity method, was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the first time. The following table shows the effects of the reclassification of  Lucura Versicherungs AG. The effects recognized in equity resulted  primarily from  the  elimination  of  provisions  against  other  BASF  Group companies that had been recognized in Lucura Versicherungs AG's separate financial statements.",

The company is majority-owned by BASF (BASF 51%; Shanshan 49%). It occupies a very strong position in the value chain for battery materials including raw materials, precursors for cathode active materials, cathode active materials and battery recycling. It focuses primarily on the electric vehicle market as well as the consumer electronics and energy storage segments. Through this investment, BASF has further strengthened its position in Asia to create an integrated global supply chain for battery materials for customers in China and worldwide. The investment strengthened the Catalysts division. The  transaction  includes  four  companies  and  approximately 1,600 employees. One of the companies was classified as an investment  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method,  but  for reasons of materiality, is recognized in BASF's financial statements at cost. The purchase price was \u20ac616/uni00A0 million and was cash-effective in full. A separate transaction valued at \u20ac36 million was connected to the purchase in accordance with IFRS 3.51 and  was  reported  under  other  receivables.  It  contains  a compensation component which is coupled with the retention of employees at the acquired companies. It affects a period of one or two years. The first tranche was fulfilled and disbursed to employees in 2022; the disbursement for the second tranche will occur when the commitment has been fulfilled in 2023. Goodwill of \u20ac254/uni00A0million resulted in particular from sales and cost synergies and  was  not  tax  deductible.  The  preliminary  purchase  price allocation for this transaction was reviewed at the end of the 12-month valuation period pursuant to IFRS/uni00A03. It did not lead to any adjustments.\n- - Furthermore,  BASF  completed  the  purchase  of  49.5%  of Vattenfall's Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm on September/uni00A01, 2021. The transaction was not reported as an acquisition because the acquired assets did not constitute a business in accordance with IFRS 3.2b, so it was not within the IFRS/uni00A03 scope of application.

These  include  other  businesses  which  comprise commodity trading, engineering and other services, as well as rental income and leases. Discontinued operations and certain activities remaining after divestitures are also reported here.\n\nThe following activities are also presented under Other:\n\n- - The steering of the BASF/uni00A0Group by corporate headquarters.\n- - Cross-divisional corporate research, which  includes  plant biotechnology research, works on long-term topics of strategic importance to the BASF/uni00A0Group. Furthermore, it focuses on the development of specific key technologies, which are of overriding importance for the divisions.\n- - Trade with renewable energies as well as the activities of the Net Zero Accelerator unit established on January/uni00A0 1, 2022, which bundles cross-company projects to achieve climate protection targets.\n- - Results from currency translation that are not allocated to the segments; earnings from the hedging of raw materials prices and foreign currency exchange risks; and gains and losses from the long-term incentive programs (LTI programs).\n- - Remanent fixed costs resulting from organizational changes or restructuring; function and region-related restructuring costs not allocated to a division; idle capacity costs from internal human resource  platforms;  and  consolidation  effects  that  cannot  be allocated to the divisions.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT) of Other\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                  |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs for cross-divisional corporate research                    |   -326 |   -355 |\n| Costs of corporate headquarters                                  |   -258 |   -255 |\n| Other businesses a                                               |    -46 |     62 |\n| Foreign currency results, hedging and other measurement  effects |     33 |    -62 |\n| Miscellaneous income and expenses                                |     74 |   -149 |\n| Income from operations of Other a                                |   -523 |   -759 |\n\n- a The polyolefins and styrenics businesses of the joint venture BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, which had been reported under Other, were allocated to the Petrochemicals division as of January/uni00A01, 2022. The prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n\nIncome from operations of Other improved by \u20ac236/uni00A0million/uni00A0year on year to -\u20ac523/uni00A0 million. This resulted mainly from miscellaneous income and expenses, which included special income in the amount of \u20ac256/uni00A0 million from the disposal of shares in the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm. Foreign currency results, hedging and other  measurement  effects  improved  by  a  total  of  \u20ac94/uni00A0 million, primarily due to income from the long-term incentive programs following expenses in the previous year as well as higher income from hedging transactions.  Furthermore, costs for cross-divisional corporate research was \u20ac29/uni00A0million lower than the prior-year figure. Income from other businesses was \u20ac108/uni00A0million lower, which had an offsetting effect.\n\nThe same accounting rules are used for segment reporting as those used for the Group, which are presented in these Notes. Transfers between the segments are generally executed at adjusted marketbased prices, taking into account the higher cost efficiency and lower  risk  of  intragroup  transactions.  Assets,  as  well  as  their depreciation and amortization, are allocated to the segments based on economic control. Assets used by more than one segment are allocated based on the percentage of usage.\n\nIncome from operations (EBIT) before special items is used for the internal  steering  of  the  segments  and  complements  the  key management indicator, return on capital employed (ROCE). It is determined based on EBIT, which is calculated from gross profit on sales, selling expenses, general administrative expenses, research and development expenses, other operating income and expenses, and income from integral companies accounted for using the equity method. To calculate EBIT before special items, this figure is then adjusted for special items. Special items arise from the integration of acquired businesses, restructuring costs, impairments and reversals of impairments, gains or losses on divestitures and sales of integral investments accounted for using the equity method, as well as other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities. EBIT and EBIT before special items are alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are to be considered as being complementary to the indicators defined by IFRS.",

The average number of outstanding shares declined compared with 2021 due to the share buyback program in 2022. Pursuant to IAS 33, a potential dilutive effect must be considered in the diluted earnings per share for those BASF shares that will be granted in the future as part of BASF's 'plus' share program. This applies regardless of the fact that the necessary shares are acquired on the market by third parties on behalf of BASF and that there are no plans to issue new shares.\n\nNo/uni00A0 dilutive effect arose from the issue of 'plus' shares in 2022 (2021:/uni00A0\u20ac0.01).\n\n- For more information on the share buyback program, see Note/uni00A019 from page 254 onward and on page/uni00A0177 in the  Corporate Governance Report",

        "page_content": "## 7 Sales revenue\n\nSales revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount of the consideration BASF expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.\n\nBASF primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Because the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, the corresponding sales revenue is recognized based on a given point in time. Determination of this point in time occurs in the context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards  takes  into  account  the  underlying  terms  of  delivery (especially  Incoterms)  and  is  of  particular  practical  significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. If products are delivered to a consignment  warehouse,  BASF  normally  retains  control  of  the goods.   Accordingly,  sales  revenue  is  not  recognized  until  the customer collects the goods from the consignment warehouse. Long-term supply agreements usually contain variable prices, which depend, among other factors, on the development of raw materials prices, and variable volumes.\n\nServices rendered to customers by BASF are invoiced according to work completed and recognized as revenue accordingly.\n\nBASF generates a portion of its sales revenue from license agreements. Sales revenue from license agreements is recognized based on a point in time or a period of time depending on whether the licensee is being granted a right to use (revenue recognized at a point in time) or a right to access (revenue recognized over time) the intellectual property of BASF. Revenues from sales and usagebased royalties are recognized when the underlying sale or usage occurs.\n\nSales  revenue  from  the  sale  of  precious  metals  to  industrial customers  is  recognized  on  delivery  and  the  corresponding purchase prices are recorded as cost of sales. In the trading of precious metals and their derivatives with traders, where there is usually  no  physical  delivery,  revenues  are  netted  against  the corresponding  costs.\n\nIf a consideration that is contractually agreed upon by a customer includes variable components, BASF estimates the amount of the consideration. Variable components are recognized as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that previously recognized sales revenue will not have to be cancelled as soon as there is no longer uncertainty about the actual amount of the consideration. Primarily rebates and other discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue in accordance with the principle of individual measurement. BASF grants customers rebates if the goods purchased by the customer exceed a contractually defined threshold within the period  specified.  Rebates  are  usually  deducted  from  amounts payable by the customer. Taking into account the specific terms of the underlying contract, BASF uses the expected value method or the most likely amount to estimate a variable consideration amount. The method is selected based primarily on number of possible results such as the number of volume thresholds with rebates. All available information, particularly historical values, is used for  making estimates.\n\nIn some contracts, BASF grants the customer the right to return goods within a specific period of time, even if they meet the agreed specifications (sale with right of return). The actual expected amount of the consideration BASF is entitled to receive in this case is estimated using the expected value method. Refund liabilities are recognized in the amount of considerations paid by the customer for goods that are expected to be returned.\n\nBASF opts to apply the practical expedient in IFRS/uni00A0 15.63 to not adjust the amount of the agreed consideration for the effects of a material financing component if, at the beginning of a contract, no more than one year is expected to lapse between the transfer of control of the goods or services and payment by the customer.\n\nBASF also applies the practical expedient in IFRS/uni00A0 15.121 of not reporting information on remaining performance obligations resulting from a contract with a maximum expected original term of one year. Furthermore, information on performance obligations is not reported if the resulting revenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS/uni00A015.B16.",

Furthermore, income  resulted  from  a  restructuring  of  the  global  glufosinateammonium production network in North America. In both years, income also resulted from the adjustment to provisions for risks from lawsuits and damage claims, closures and restructuring measures, employee obligations, and various other individual items as part of the normal course of business.

In addition, income resulted in 2022 from the release of provisions for the long-term incentive (LTI) programs in the amount of \u20ac24/uni00A0 million. By contrast, expenses were incurred in 2021 for additions to these provisions.\n\nIncome from foreign currency transactions and the translation of  financial  statements  in  foreign  currencies related  to  the translation of receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies and included income from the translation of companies' financial statements whose local currency is different from the functional currency.\n\nGains on divestitures and the disposal of noncurrent assets in 2022 were mainly from the sale of 51% of shares in the company holding the interest in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm and the sale of the production site in Quincy, Florida. Gains resulted in 2021 from the sale of a production site in Kankakee, Illinois, the sale of the share in the condensate splitter in Port Arthur, Texas, and the sale of the precision microchemicals business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2021,  these  were attributable to the divestiture of the production site in Quincy,  Florida, and the associated attapulgite business.\n\nIncome from the reversal of valuation allowances for businessrelated receivables resulted both from the reversal of impairments for settled customer receivables for which impairments had been recorded previously as well as from adjusted expectations regarding default on individual customer receivables.\n\nOther income included refunds in the amount of \u20ac169/uni00A0 million in 2022 and \u20ac211/uni00A0 million in 2021. This was due in both years to government  grants  in  multiple  countries,  regional  business development subsidies in China, and transaction tax refunds in Brazil.

Further expenses arose in 2022 from the development of the new Verbund site in China and the battery materials business  in  Schwarzheide,  Germany. Additionally, expenses of \u20ac59/uni00A0 million in 2022 and \u20ac266/uni00A0 million in 2021 arose from additions to environmental provisions.

In 2021, this item included expenses from LTI programs in the amount of \u20ac37/uni00A0million. Further expenses resulted from  changes in the fair value of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions in both years.\n\nLosses from divestitures and the disposal of noncurrent assets were mainly due to the agreed divestiture of the De Meern site in the Netherlands in 2022 and to the divestiture of the global  pigments business in 2021.\n\nExpenses  from  the  addition  of  valuation  allowances  on business-related  receivables were significantly lower than in the previous year, in which valuation allowances had arisen particularly in connection with a transaction tax in Brazil.\n\nIn both years, other expenses included expenses for litigation, for REACH, for the provision of services and for warranties. Furthermore, other expenses for societal engagement and in connection with the coronavirus pandemic arose in both years.\n\n## 10   Investments accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amounts of shareholdings are adjusted annually based on the pro rata share of net income, dividends and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment test is conducted and, if necessary, an impairment is recognized in the income  statement.  In  the  case  of  publicly  listed  associated companies, share prices are included in the impairment test and form the basis of valuation if there is an indication for  permanent impairment or reversal of an impairment.  Furthermore, earnings and the carrying amount are adjusted when accounting policies deviate or as a result of purchase price allocations, which primarily affects Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany.\n\nExploration and development expenses in the oil and gas business, for which the equity method is applied, are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory drilling as well as successful and dry development wells are capitalized.\n\nIncome from integral companies accounted for using the equity method  is  presented  in  EBIT,  and  income  from  non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method is presented together with income from other financial assets in net income from shareholdings.  Similarly,  integral  and  non-integral  shareholdings accounted for using the equity method are also shown separately in the balance sheet. The material equity-accounted shareholding that is classified as integral is BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, in which BASF and Sinopec each hold 50%, and which operates the Verbund  site in Nanjing, China. The  material non-integral shareholding is the Wintershall/uni00A0 Dea AG oil and gas company, in which BASF holds a 72.7% share. The remaining shares are held by LetterOne.

For this reason, Wintershall Dea deconsolidated its  shareholdings in Russia in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fair value  adjustments carried forward at BASF from 2019 until that point were also  derecognized. In turn, Wintershall Dea recognized its shareholdings as financial assets at fair value in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09. Interventions by the Russian government, particularly in\n\nthe second half of 2022, had a severe negative impact on this value. Therefore, the initial value of the financial assets in the amount of \u20ac248/uni00A0million was significantly below the previous value contribution and  led  to  deconsolidation  losses  in  BASF's  net  income  from shareholdings in the amount of \u20ac4,353/uni00A0million (including previously recognized  impairments).  Moreover,  Wintershall  Dea  recognized\n\n## Reconciliation of the carrying amount of the shareholding in BASF-YPC Company/uni00A0Ltd.\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| BASF interest                                                                  | 50%    | 50%    |\n| Carrying amount as of the beginning of the year                                | 1,148  | 710    |\n| Proportional income after taxes and other adjustments to   income and expenses | 213    | 409    |\n| Proportional changes in other comprehensive income                             | -25    | 103    |\n| Capital increase                                                               | 31     | -      |\n| Dividends received                                                             | -429   | -74    |\n| Carrying amount as of the end of the year                                      | 938    | 1,148  |\n\n## 10.2 Non-integral companies accounted for using the equity  method\n\n## Income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                           | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Proportional income after taxes                                           | -3,514 | 435    |\n| of which joint ventures                                                   | -      | -      |\n| associated companies                                                      | -3,514 | 435    |\n| Other adjustments to income and expenses                                  | -1,371 | -739   |\n| of which joint ventures                                                   | -      | -      |\n| associated companies                                                      | -1,371 | -739   |\n| Income from the divestiture of shares in Solenis                          | -      | 589    |\n| Income from non-integral companies accounted for  using the equity method | -4,885 | 285    |",

        "page_content": "impairments on further Russia-related assets: As a result of the damage to the Nord Stream/uni00A0 1 and Nord Stream/uni00A0 2 pipelines, the shareholding  in  Nord  Stream/uni00A0 AG  (BASF  interest  after  taxes \u20ac997/uni00A0million) as well as financing of Nord Stream/uni00A02 (BASF share after taxes \u20ac729/uni00A0million) were fully impaired over the course of 2022. In addition, impairments of \u20ac438/uni00A0million (BASF share after taxes) on Winters hall/uni00A0 Dea's gas transportation business were recognized in connection with the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions and counter- sanctions.  Deconsolidation  effects  and  Russia-related impairments  totaled  \u20ac6,517/uni00A0 million  (BASF  share  after  taxes)  in income from non-integral equity-accounted companies.\n\nFurthermore, Wintershall Dea recognized expenses for impairments and reversals of impairments on assets in Germany, Mexico, Egypt and Algeria in the total amount of \u20ac58/uni00A0 million (BASF share after taxes).\n\nValues in use were determined for the impairment test conducted by BASF as of December/uni00A031, 2022. The underlying assumptions for production and cost trends as well as the price assumptions for 2023 to 2040 largely correspond with Wintershall/uni00A0Dea's. For 2023, an oil price of $85/uni00A0per bbl of Brent crude and a gas price (TTF) of $35/uni00A0 per mmBtu were assumed. After a decline in oil prices to approximately $71/uni00A0 per bbl in 2024, and in gas prices to around $10/uni00A0 per mmBtu from 2024 to 2028, a subsequent increase is assumed at a nominal rate of 2% p.a. for both oil and gas. The expected cash flows were discounted using country-specific cost of capital rates, which reflect the relevant country risks and tax rates. The cost of capital rates in euros, calculated using the capital asset pricing model, were between 5.3% and 25.0% (2021: between 3.4% and 14.3%). On that basis, proportional impairments resulted in the amount of \u20ac11/uni00A0million after taxes and reversals of impairments of \u20ac55/uni00A0million after taxes on the fair value adjustments from 2019. The shareholding as a whole is recoverable.\n\nBoth a decrease of 10% in oil and gas price assumptions for the entire planning period and an increase of one percentage point in the cost of capital rate would not result in the need for an impairment of the shareholding as a whole. By contrast, a 10% price decrease would result in a decrease of \u20ac45/uni00A0million (after taxes) in proportional reversals  of  impairments  as  well  as  in  additional  proprtional impairments of \u20ac47/uni00A0million after taxes. An increase in capital cost\n\nrates of one  percentage point would lead to lower proportional reversals of impairments of \u20ac31/uni00A0million after taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on Wintershall Dea, see the chapter on Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business in the Management's Report from page 92 onward\n\n## Reconciliation of the carrying amounts of non-integral joint ventures accounted for using the equity method and associated companies Million \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                 | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associated companies   | Associated companies   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | 2022             | 2021             | 2022                   | 2021                   |\n| Carrying amounts according to the equity method as of the beginning of the year | -                | 10,199           | 9,843                  | 675                    |\n| Proportional income after taxes and other adjustments to income and expenses    | -                | -                | -4,885                 | -304                   |\n| Proportional changes in other comprehensive income                              | -                | -                | 645                    | 216                    |\n| Total comprehensive income                                                      | -                | -                | -4,240                 | -88                    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                                           | -                | -                | -                      | -18                    |\n| Additions                                                                       | -                | -                | -                      | -                      |\n| Disposals                                                                       | -                | -                | -                      | -                      |\n| Transfers                                                                       | -                | -10,199          | -958                   | 9,274                  |\n| Carrying amounts according to the equity method as of the end of the year       | -                | -                | 4,645                  | 9,843                  |\n\nProportional  income  after  taxes  and  other  adjustments  to income and expenses for the associated companies declined mainly because of the negative earnings contribution of Wintershall Dea/uni00A0AG due to the impairments recognized as well as losses from the deconsolidation of its Russian shareholdings. Furthermore, an impairment on the shareholding in Quantafuel ASA is also included.\n\nProportional changes in other comprehensive income predominantly included currency effects at Wintershall/uni00A0Dea. With the deconsolidation of the Russian shareholdings held by Wintershall Dea, total differences arising from currency translation of \u20ac868/uni00A0 million were reclassified as earnings to the income statement.\n\nTransfers in 2022 contained primarily Wintershall Dea's dividend payments. Transfers in 2021 mainly related to the reclassification of Wintershall Dea, which had been under joint control until October 2021, from joint ventures to associated companies.",

        "page_content": "## 12 Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon are levied on all distributed and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax. It varies depending on  the  municipality  in  which  the  company  is  represented.  The weighted average tax rate was 14.6% in 2022 (2021: 14.6%). The 30%  rate  used  to  calculate  deferred  taxes  for  German  Group companies remained unchanged in 2022. The income of foreign Group companies is assessed using the tax rates applicable in their respective  countries.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements according to IFRS and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. These also comprise temporary differences arising from business combinations, with the exception of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the respective country-specific tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is realized or settled. Tax rate changes enacted or substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date are taken into consideration.\n\nDeferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority. Surpluses of deferred tax assets are only recognized provided that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on the probability of a reversal of the differences and the assessment of the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. This depends on whether future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits can be claimed. The assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on internal projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company.\n\nChanges in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded as deferred tax expense or income unless the underlying transaction is recognized directly in equity or in income and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects which have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these differences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for dividend  distributions  planned  for  the  following  year  if  these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences.\n\nProvisions for German trade tax, corporate income tax and similar income taxes are calculated and recognized based on the expected taxable income of the consolidated companies less any  prepayments that have been made. Provisions are set up for interest  accrued. This interest is reported under other financial result, not tax expense. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accordingly.\n\nIFRIC/uni00A0 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement policies from IAS/uni00A0 12 when there is uncertainty regarding income tax-related treatment of individual transactions. They are accounted for with the assumption that tax authorities will examine the questionable transaction and have all relevant information. The amount  of  risk  provisions  is  calculated  and  reviewed  with consideration for the results of past tax audits as well as the legal assessment of not yet audited transactions and the risk of a  deviating tax-related interpretation by the tax authorities. The most probable value of the individual risks is recognized.\n\n## Tax expense and tax rate\n\nThe  BASF/uni00A0 Group  tax  rate  amounted  to  132.9%  in  2022 (2021:/uni00A019.2%). The very high tax rate in comparison to that of the previous year resulted mainly from non-tax-effective impairments of Wintershall  Dea/uni00A0 AG,  which  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity method,   particularly  from  the  deconsolidation  of  its  Russian exploration and production activities.",

Of these, \u20ac4/uni00A0 million will expire in 2023, \u20ac0/uni00A0million in 2024, \u20ac5/uni00A0million in 2025, \u20ac3/uni00A0million in 2026, \u20ac62/uni00A0million in 2027, and \u20ac41/uni00A0million in 2028 and thereafter. The remaining \u20ac3,144/uni00A0million will not expire.\n\nSurpluses of deferred tax assets for companies that reported tax losses in 2022 or 2021 totaled \u20ac376/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022 (December/uni00A0 31,  2021:  \u20ac2,072/uni00A0 million). Deferred  taxes  were recognized because, due to planned earnings, the use of temporary differences or loss carryforwards is expected.\n\n## Tax liabilities\n\nTax liabilities primarily include assessed income taxes and other taxes as well as estimated income taxes not yet assessed for the current year.",

The weighted average amortization periods of intangible assets were as follows:\n\nAcquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined useful  lives  are  generally  measured  at  cost  less  straight-line amortization. The useful life is determined using the period of the underlying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.\n\nImpairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development expenses or other operating expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other internally generated intangible assets are measured at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of internally generated intangible assets also include an appropriate portion of overhead costs.\n\n## Weighted average amortization in years\n\n|                                               |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Distribution and similar rights               |     13 |     15 |\n| Product rights, licenses and trademarks a     |     18 |     25 |\n| Know-how, patents and production technologies |     15 |     16 |\n| Internally generated intangible assets        |      6 |      5 |\n| Other rights and values                       |      9 |      8 |\n\n- a The reassessment of the expected useful lives of two acquired trademarks in the Agricultural Solutions segment led to an increase in annual amortization of \u20ac23/uni00A0million and thus to the decrease in the weighted average amortization in years.\n\nEmission rights: Emission certificates, which are granted free of charge  by  the  German  Emissions  Trading  Authority  (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized in the balance sheet with a value of zero. Emission rights purchased on the market are capitalized at cost as intangible assets. Emissions generated create an obligation to surrender the emission certificates.  Intangible  assets  purchased  on  the  market  are subsequently measured at fair value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition costs. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.\n\nGoodwill is  only  written  down  in  the  case  of  an  impairment. Impairment  testing  for  goodwill  is  performed  once  a  year  and whenever there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.\n\nIn both years, BASF's goodwill was allocated to 20 cash-generating units, which are defined either on the basis of business units or at a higher level.\n\nThe respective recoverable amounts were determined using the value in use. Plans approved by company management and their respective cash flows for the next five years were used. For the period thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection from the last detailed planning year as a perpetual  annuity. Planning  is  based  on  experience,  current  performance  and management's best possible estimates on the future development of individual parameters, such as sales revenue (excluding precious metals), contribution margins, fixed costs and investments from which income from operations before depreciation and amortization is determined based on which EBITDA margin is derived. Market assumptions  regarding, for example, gas and raw materials prices, exchange rates, economic development, inflation expectations and market growth of the respective customer industries are included based on external macroeconomic and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe  fundamental transformation of the automotive industry will have a  significant  impact  on  the  emissions  catalyst  business,  which belongs  to  the  Catalysts  (excluding  battery  materials)  cashgenerating unit. Because there were no material changes in planning assumptions from the previous year, the growth rate for perpetual annuity  remained unchanged at -0.7%. In the planning period, the demand for catalysts is still expected to remain stable as a result of higher environmental standards. In the medium term, the transition from combustion engines to electromobility will lead to a steady decline in demand.",

In upcoming years, the assumption is that average gas and raw materials prices in Germany will only slowly return to a level that is comparable to that of other regions. From 2024, a decline in prices is expected, which was accounted for in the respective  planning.\n\nIn addition, planning is also based on the strategies of the individual strategic  business  units  which  comprise  the  respective  cashgenerating units. The digitalization and sustainability trends identified in the strategies are thus taken into account in the respective impairment  tests.\n\n- For more information on strategy and identified digitalization and sustainability trends in the Management's Report, see page 29 onward and page 45 onward\n\nThe required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the weighted cost of capital, see Note 1 from page 209 onward\n\nDuring  the  first  half  of  2022,  BASF's  market  capitalization  fell significantly below the carrying amount of equity recognized in the balance  sheet.  BASF  therefore  reviewed  whether  a  need  for impairment could be derived from this, especially of goodwill, as of June/uni00A030, 2022. The tests showed that there were no indications of goodwill impairment as of June/uni00A030, 2022.\n\n- For more information on the review of goodwill as of June/uni00A030, 2022,  see Note 11 of the Half-Year Financial Report from page 39 onward\n\nThe annual impairment tests of the 20 cash-generating units were performed in the fourth quarter of 2022. The calculation also takes into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating unit. Impairment tests were performed on the units assuming a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of between 5.97% and 7.75% (2021: between 5.51% and 6.67%). This corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes of between 6.96% and 10.80% (2021: between 6.53% and 8.94%).\n\nAfter determining the recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units, the conclusion was that reasonable possible deviations from the key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of any unit exceeding the respective recoverable amounts except in the Catalysts  (excluding  battery  materials)  and  Surface  Treatment divisions, which are allocated to the Surface Technologies segment.\n\nThe recoverable amount for the Surface Treatment cash-generating unit exceeded the carrying amount by \u20ac108/uni00A0million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac408/uni00A0million). A weighted cost of capital after taxes of 7.75% (2021: 6.67%) and an EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year were used as the basis for calculating the final value of 17.00% (2021: 18.88%) for the impairment test. The recoverable amount would be equal to the unit's carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rose by 0.34 percentage points (2021: 1.05/uni00A0percentage points), the growth rate were 0.48/uni00A0 percentage points (2021: 1.46/uni00A0 percentage points) lower, or the EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year as the basis for calculating the final value were 0.95/uni00A0percentage points (2021: 3.37/uni00A0percentage points) lower.",

In addition, goodwill was derecognized through  divestitures  in  the  Surface  Technologies  and  Industrial Solutions  segments.\n\nTransfers to disposal groups related to adjustments to goodwill of the divested kaolin minerals business.\n\nIn 2022,  additions  to accumulated  amortization contained impairments of \u20ac4/uni00A0 million.

The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully expensed in the year of acquisition.\n\nThe cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs,  appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions involved in the construction of the plants.\n\nExpenses  related  to  the  scheduled  maintenance  of  large-scale plants are capitalized separately and depreciated using the straightline method over the period until the next planned turnaround. Costs for the replacement of components are recognized as assets if an additional future benefit is expected. The carrying amount of the replaced components is derecognized. Costs for maintenance and repair as part of normal business operations are recognized as an expense.\n\nAs lessee, BASF generally recognizes all leases in the balance sheet. The right-of-use assets from leases and lease liabilities are  measured at the present value of the financial commitments entered into.\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A016 from page 250 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair value or cost less depreciation.\n\nBoth  movable  and  immovable  fixed  assets  are  principally depre ciated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives and depreciation methods of property, plant and equipment are based on historical values, plans and estimates. The depreciation  methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe weighted average depreciation periods were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average depreciation in years\n\n|                                   | 2022   | 2021                                   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                   | 17 18  | Buildings and structural installations |\n| Machinery and technical equipment | 11 11  |                                        |\n|                                   | 7 7    | Miscellaneous equipment and fixtures   |\n\nIf there is indication of a possible cause for impairment, an  impairment test is performed. Impairments to property, plant and equipment are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. An impairment is recognized for the difference  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the  recoverable amount.  If  the  reasons  for  an  impairment  no  longer  exist,  the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment  not  been  recognized.  Impairments  and  reversals  of impairments are reported in other operating income and expenses.\n\n- For more information on the value in use and the weighted cost of capital, see Note/uni00A01 from page/uni00A0209 onward\n\nBorrowing costs: If borrowing costs are directly incurred as part of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, they are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which the process necessary to make it ready for its intended use or sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. Borrowing costs were calculated based on a rate of 1.25% (previous year: 1.25%) and adjusted on a country-specific basis, if necessary. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nGovernment grants: Government grants related to the acquisition or  construction  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  reduce  the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets. Other government  grants  or  government  assistance  are  recognized immediately  as  other  operating  income  or  treated  as  deferred income and  released over the underlying period.",

        "page_content": "Additions to property, plant and equipment arising from investment projects (excluding leases) amounted to \u20ac4,261/uni00A0 million in 2022. Investments  were  made  at  the  following  sites  in  particular: Ludwigshafen,  Germany;  Antwerp,  Belgium;  Zhanjiang,  China; Geismar, Louisiana; and Schwarzheide, Germany. Material investments  included  the  development  of  infrastructure  and technical equipment at the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, as well  as  construction  and  expansion  of  the  ethylene  oxide  and polyethylene  oxide  production  plants  in  Antwerp,  Belgium,  and Ludwigshafen, Germany.  Investments  also comprised  the construction  of  infrastructure  and  production  plants  for  battery materials  in  Schwarzheide,  Germany.  Government  grants  for funding investment measures reduced asset additions by \u20ac7/uni00A0million .\n\nIn 2022, impairments of \u20ac390/uni00A0million and reversals of impairments of \u20ac20/uni00A0million were included in accumulated depreciation.\n\nDue to the planned divestiture of the site, impairments of \u20ac80 million related  to  construction  in  progress,  machinery  and  technical equipment, buildings and land as well as miscellaneous equipment at a production site in Europe in the Surface Technologies segment. Furthermore, there was a complete write-down in the amount of \u20ac24/uni00A0million due to a production plant closure in North America in the Materials segment. In addition, several older assets in Ludwigshafen, Germany,  pertaining  to  the  Materials  segment  with  a  residual carrying amount of \u20ac13/uni00A0million were fully written down. Impairments to construction in progress mainly related to discontinued  investment projects. The deteriorating cost position in Europe, due mainly to the significant  rise  in  gas  prices,  led  to  intermittent  production discontinuations and low capacity utilization at various plants in Europe, especially in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Impairment tests were therefore conducted on the relevant plants, which resulted in the  partial   impairment  of  a  production  plant  in  the  Chemicals segment in the amount of \u20ac195/uni00A0 million. The value in use in the amount of \u20ac350/uni00A0 million was calculated based on the assumption that gas prices in Germany in the next three years would only slowly return to a level that would lead to a cost position comparable with that in other  regions. The value in use was calculated applying a weighted cost of capital after taxes of 8.22%, which had been\n\nadjusted to account for the risk of this planning calculation. This corresponds to a cost of capital rate before taxes of 12.0%.\n\nReversals of impairments in the amount of \u20ac20/uni00A0 million resulted primarily from an increase in the fair value of plants impaired at a site in North America in 2020.\n\nTransfers related mainly to the reclassification of operation-ready assets from construction in progress to other asset categories.\n\nTransfers  to  disposal  groups related  to  the  adjustment  of reclassified amounts in connection with the divested kaolin minerals business .\n\n- For more information on divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page 216 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCurrency  effects raised  property,  plant  and  equipment  by \u20ac286/uni00A0million/uni00A0and resulted mainly from appreciation of the U.S./uni00A0dollar against the euro .",

If separation is required under IFRS, the embedded lease is recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is accounted  and  measured  in  accordance  with  the  applicable regulations.\n\nAs lessee, BASF accounts for nearly all leases, recognizing right-ofuse assets for leased assets and liabilities for lease agreements. The following principles are considered:\n\n- - BASF  exercises  the  exemption  for  lease  agreements  with  a maximum term of 12/uni00A0 months from the date of provision and low-value  assets.  Low-value  assets  are  generally  defined  as leased assets worth a maximum of \u20ac5,000.\n- - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, taking into account the incremental borrowing rate.\n- - As a general rule, BASF separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.\n- - A right-of-use asset is generally recognized at the same amount as the lease liability. Differences may arise from the lease payments made prior to the provision of the leased asset, less any lease incentives received.\n- - After  capitalization  at  the  commencement  date,  whereby  the right-of-use asset is measured at cost, the right-of-use asset is generally depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method.\n- - A number of leases, particularly for real estate and barges, include extension and termination options. Extension and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease liability only if BASF is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms are being determined, consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that offer an economic  incentive  for  exercising  extension  options  or  not exercising termination options. Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option or non-exercise of a termination option are only considered if sufficient certainty exists. Estimates and  expectations  which  are  asserted  at  the commencement date of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments not yet determined on the date of provision are assessed continuously during the lease term. If subsequently improved or changed knowledge influences the  expected  payment  profile  over  time,  the  lease  liability  is remeasured.\n- - If an existing lease contract is modified, the lease liability and right-of-use asset must be remeasured, provided the modification changes the payment profile (pursuant to the interest and  principal\n\n## BASF as lessee\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                  | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                  | Lease   liabilities        | Interest portion           | Future   lease payments    | Lease   liabilities        | Interest portion           | Future   lease payments    |\n| Following year 1 | 330                        | 43                         | 373                        | 336                        | 30                         | 366                        |\n| Following year 2 | 222                        | 36                         | 258                        | 219                        | 27                         | 246                        |\n| Following year 3 | 150                        | 30                         | 180                        | 153                        | 29                         | 182                        |\n| Following year 4 | 111                        | 26                         | 137                        | 100                        | 25                         | 125                        |\n| Following year 5 | 85                         | 23                         | 108                        | 74                         | 20                         | 94                         |\n| Over 5 years     | 591                        | 171                        | 762                        | 532                        | 167                        | 699                        |\n| Total            | 1,489                      | 329                        | 1,818                      | 1,414                      | 298                        | 1,712                      |\n\nplan) or the scope (either quantitatively or time-related) of use of the asset.\n\nBASF presents the interest component of lease payments in cash flows from operating activities and the repayment portion in cash flows from financing activities.

If the market price or the fair value of the sales products, which are based on the net  realizable values, is lower, then the sales products are written down to this lower value. The net realizable value is the estimated price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs.\n\nIn  addition  to  direct  costs,  cost  of  conversion  includes  an appropriate  allocation  of  production  overhead  costs  based  on normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that they are related to the production process. Pensions, social services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as well as allocations for administrative  costs,  provided  they  relate  to  the  production. Borrowing costs are not included in cost of conversion.\n\nInventories may be impaired if the prices for the sales products decline, or in cases of a high rate of days sales of inventory (DSI). Write-downs on inventories are reversed if the reasons for them no longer apply.\n\nThe exception made by IAS/uni00A02 for traders is applied to the measurement of precious metals. Accordingly, inventories held exclusively for trading purposes are measured at fair value less costs to sell and recognized in the precious metal trading item (carrying amount as of December/uni00A0 31, 2022: \u20ac1,939/uni00A0 million; as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021: \u20ac1,554/uni00A0 million) under miscellaneous current assets.

The change in current derivatives with positive fair market values was largely attributable to the increase in fair values of commodity derivatives for precious metals.\n\nBank acceptance drafts are used as an alternative form of  payment in China. Bank acceptance drafts are issued at a discount from their par  value.  They  can  be  held  to  maturity,  traded  or  redeemed prematurely at a discount. If BASF discounts a bank acceptance draft  with  recourse,  a  liability  toward  the  credit  institution  is recognized in the amount of the payment received.\n\nPrepaid  expenses in  2022  mainly  included  prepayments  of \u20ac45/uni00A0million related to operating activities compared with \u20ac41/uni00A0million in 2021, as well as \u20ac77/uni00A0million in prepayments for insurance in 2022 compared with \u20ac93/uni00A0million in 2021. Prepayments for license costs increased from \u20ac49/uni00A0million in 2021 to \u20ac55/uni00A0million in 2022.\n\nAs in the previous year, defined benefit assets were recognized in 2022  mainly  for  the  contractual  trust  arrangement  of  BASF Pensions treuhand/uni00A0e.V. as well as at Group companies in Switzerland and the United Kingdom. An asset ceiling came into effect in 2022 for the pension plans in Switzerland.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No compensation claims were incurred in either 2022 or 2021.\n\nPayment  terms  are  generally  agreed  upon  individually  with customers and, as a rule, are within 90/uni00A0 days. In 2022, valuation allowances of \u20ac130/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac120/uni00A0million) were added for trade accounts  receivable,  and  valuation  allowances  of  \u20ac124/uni00A0 million (2021: \u20ac110/uni00A0million) were reversed.\n\nIn 2022, valuation allowances of \u20ac24/uni00A0 million were recognized for other receivables representing financial instruments, and valuation allowances  of  \u20ac19/uni00A0 million  were  reversed.

There are no preferential rights or other restrictions.\n\nThe subscribed capital of BASF SE as of December/uni00A031, 2022, was \u20ac1,144 million, divided into 893,854,929 qualifying shares with no par value. The share capital and the number of shares decreased in 2022  due  to  the  redemption  of  acquired  treasury  shares  in connection with the share buyback program.\n\nThe subscribed capital as of December/uni00A031, 2021, was    \u20ac1,176/uni00A0million, divided into 918,478,694 shares.\n\n## Share buyback / treasury shares\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A012, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to buy back treasury shares until May/uni00A011, 2022, in accordance with section/uni00A071(1) no./uni00A08 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). On April/uni00A0 29,  2022,  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  approved  a renewal  of  the  authorization  to  purchase  treasury  shares  until April/uni00A028, 2027.\n\nThe buyback may not exceed 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed and can take place via the stock  exchange,  a  public  purchase  offer  addressed  to  all shareholders, or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit sales offers.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is authorized to redeem the shares bought back without a further resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the redeemed shares. The Board of Executive Directors can also redeem the shares without reducing the share capital so that the proportion of the other shares in relation to the share capital is increased through the redemption. In that\n\nevent, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to adjust the number of shares in the Statutes.\n\nIn 2022, BASF purchased a total of 24,623,765/uni00A0shares or 2.68% of the share capital through the buyback authorizations at an average price \u20ac53.83 per share. All repurchased shares were redeemed and the share capital was reduced accordingly. BASF did not hold any treasury shares as of the balance sheet date.\n\nBASF's  expenditure  in  2022  for  the  share  buyback  totaled \u20ac1,325/uni00A0million. The amount was taken from other retained earnings and also reduced subscribed capital by \u20ac32/uni00A0million. This reduction was reclassified to capital reserves. The share buyback authorization was not utilized in 2021.\n\n## Authorized capital\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on May/uni00A0 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May/uni00A02, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions, the company's share capital by a total of up to \u20ac470/uni00A0million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind. In principle, shareholders are entitled to a subscription right. However, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' statutory subscription rights in the cases specified in the authorizing resolution. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to lay down the further contents of the share rights and the details of the execution of the capital increase. The total shares issued on the basis of the above authorization with the exclusion of the shareholders' subscription right in the case of capital increases in return for contributions in cash or in kind must not exceed 10% of the share capital at the time that this authorization comes into effect or - if this value is lower - at the time of its exercise. The proportionate amount of the share capital of those shares that are to be issued on the basis of conversion or option bonds  granted  during  the  term  of  this  authorization  under  the exclusion of the subscription right, must be credited against the\n\naforementioned ceiling of 10%. This authorization has not been exercised to date.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nThe  existing  authorization  passed  by  an  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting resolution on May/uni00A0 12, 2017, to issue convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants expired on May/uni00A011, 2022. At the  Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A0 29, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors was again authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, up to April/uni00A0 28, 2027, on a one-off basis or in portions on more than one occasion to issue bearer or registered convertible bonds  and/or  bonds  with  warrants  or  a  combination  of  these instruments with or without maturity limitations with a total nominal value of up to \u20ac10/uni00A0 billion and to grant or impose holders and/or creditors of these debt instruments conversion or option rights for up to 91,847,800 registered shares in the company with a pro rata amount of share capital of up to \u20ac117,565,184 subject to the respective terms and conditions of the debt instruments. The debt instruments can be issued in exchange for contributions in cash, but also for contributions in kind, particularly shareholdings in other companies.\n\nTo hedge the subscription right to conversion and option rights issued under the authorization, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 with the option of issuing a maximum  of  91,847,800/uni00A0 new  registered  BASF  shares.  The conditional capital increase shall only be carried out to the extent to which holders of convertible bonds or warrants attached to bonds with warrants issued by the company or one of its subsidiaries up to April/uni00A0 28, 2027, under the authorization granted to the Board of Executive Directors, exercise their conversion or option rights and/ or fulfill their conversion or option obligations, and provided that no other forms of fulfillment of delivery are used. The new BASF shares shall be issued at the conversion or option prices determined in each case in the terms and conditions of the debt instruments and/ or the warrants  in  accordance  with  the  above-mentioned authorization. The new BASF shares issued under this provision shall participate in profits from the beginning of the financial year in",

This authorization had not been exercised as of the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves include effects from BASF's share program, premiums from capital increases and consideration for warrants and negative  goodwill  from  the  capital  consolidation  resulting  from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the issue of BASF/uni00A0SE shares at par value.\n\nThe proportion of share capital accounted for by the redeemed treasury shares in 2022 was reclassified to capital reserves.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings include earnings generated in the past and in 2022  by  companies  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nThe acquisition of shares in companies that BASF already controls or that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint arrangement is treated as a transaction between shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a change in the consolidation method. There were no material transactions of this type in 2022, as in the previous year.\n\nIn connection with the share buyback, the amount in excess of the nominal value was deducted from retained earnings. Upon redemption of the shares, the previously openly deducted amounts were offset against share capital and retained earnings. Additionally, the value of share capital accounted for by the redeemed shares was reclassified from retained earnings to capital reserves. This resulted in a total reduction of retained earnings of \u20ac1,325 million/uni00A0in 2022.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                         | December/uni00A031,  2022   | December/uni00A031,  2021   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Legal reserves          | 1,032                       | 958                         |\n| Other retained earnings | 34,422                      | 39,407                      |\n| Retained earnings       | 35,453                      | 40,365                      |\n\nLegal reserves rose by \u20ac74/uni00A0 million in 2022 and by \u20ac57/uni00A0million in 2021 due to reclassifications from retained earnings.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A029, 2022, BASF/uni00A0SE paid a dividend of \u20ac3.40/uni00A0per qualifying share from the retained profit of the 2021/uni00A0fiscal year. With 903,468,202/uni00A0 qualifying  shares  as  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting, this represented total dividends of \u20ac3,071,971,886.80. The remaining \u20ac856,529,452.43 in retained profits was allocated to retained earnings.",

        "page_content": "## 20 Other comprehensive income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe expenses and income shown in other comprehensive income are divided into two categories: Items that will be recognized in the income statement in the future (known as 'recycling') and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in the future. The first category includes gains and losses from currency translation, the measurement of certain securities classified as debt instruments, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to hedge future cash flows. Items that will not be reclassified to the income statement at a future date include effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\n\nChanges in the value of defined benefit plans led to an increase in other  comprehensive  income  of  \u20ac2,586/uni00A0 million  in  2022  and \u20ac2,709/uni00A0million in the previous year (after taxes in both years). Of that, \u20ac83/uni00A0million was attributable to investments accounted for using the equity method in 2022 (2021: \u20ac44/uni00A0million). Deferred taxes amounted to -\u20ac1,256/uni00A0million in 2022 and to -\u20ac811/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\nBecause of the disposal of the pigments business on June/uni00A030,/uni00A02021, the amount of \u20ac48/uni00A0million for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, plus an additional \u20ac6/uni00A0million resulting from the disposal of the operational  companies  held  by  Solenis  UK  International/uni00A0 Ltd., London, United Kingdom, which had been accounted for using the equity method until that date, was reclassified, in equity, from other comprehensive income to retained earnings in 2021. Moreover, deferred  taxes  in  the  amount  of  -\u20ac18/uni00A0 million  arising  from  an adjustment in connection with the introduction of IAS/uni00A019 were offset against retained earnings in equity.\n\nFor more information on the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, see Note/uni00A022 from page 261\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Currency translation\n\nDifferences resulting from currency translation increased equity in 2022 by a total of \u20ac1,135/uni00A0 million and by \u20ac2,205/uni00A0 million in the previous year. This included deferred taxes in the amount of  -\u20ac7/uni00A0million in 2022 (2021: -\u20ac19/uni00A0 million). Equity-accounted investments accounted  for  \u20ac583/uni00A0 million  (2021:  \u20ac697/uni00A0 million).  In  2022,  the difference resulted mainly from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real and, in 2021, mainly from the appreciation of the U.S./uni00A0dollar and the Chinese renminbi relative to the euro.\n\nWith the deconsolidation of the Russian shareholdings held by Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, total differences arising from currency translation of \u20ac868/uni00A0million were reclassified as earnings to the income statement.\n\nAs  a  result  of  divestitures  and  other  changes  in  the  scope  of consolidation, \u20ac52/uni00A0million after taxes was reclassified to the income statement in 2021.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  designated  in  hedging relationships (cash flow hedges) adjusted for deferred taxes in the amount of -\u20ac8/uni00A0million (2021: -\u20ac10/uni00A0million) reduced equity by a total of \u20ac33/uni00A0 million (2021: \u20ac329/uni00A0 million). In 2022, \u20ac37/uni00A0 million (2021: -\u20ac381/uni00A0million) was attributable to the hedging of future cash flows at shareholdings accounted for using the equity method.\n\nFor more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note/uni00A026.5 from page 279 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 22 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn addition to state pension plans, most employees are granted company  pension  benefits  from  either  defined  contribution  or defined benefit plans. Benefits generally depend on years of service, contributions or compensation, and take into consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security laws of the countries where the companies are located. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, employees have, for a number of years now, been almost  exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service.\n\nThe Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all pension plans  of  the  Group  with  regard  to  the  financing  of  pension commitments and the portfolio structure of existing plan assets. The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and reporting  requirements are documented for the units involved.\n\nThe accounting policies presented in the following relate to defined benefit pension obligations.\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  are  calculated  on  an  actuarial  basis  in accordance with the projected unit credit method. Assumptions relating to the following valuation parameters, among others are used: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee  turnover,  and  the  life  expectancy  of  beneficiaries. Obligations are discounted based on the market yields on highquality corporate fixed-rate bonds.\n\nSimilar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.\n\nActuarial  reports  are  used  to  calculate  the  amount  of  pension provisions.\n\nActuarial gains and losses from changes in estimates relating to the actuarial assumptions used to calculate defined benefit obligations, the difference between standardized and actual returns on plan assets, as well as the effects of the asset ceiling are recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income.\n\n## Economic and legal environment of the plans\n\nIn some countries - especially in Germany, in the United States, in the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Switzerland  -  there  are  pension obligations  subject  to  government  supervision  or  similar  legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements to  cover  pension  obligations,  which  are  based  on  actuarial assumptions that differ from those pursuant to IAS/uni00A019. Furthermore, there are qualitative and quantitative restrictions on allocating plan assets  to  certain  asset  categories.  This  could  result  in  annual fluctuations in employer contributions, financing measures and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe obligations and the plan assets used to fund the obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen developments on commodity and capital  markets.  They  affect,  for  example,  pension  adjustments based  on  the  level  of  inflation  in  Germany  and  in  the  United Kingdom, as well as the impact of discount rates on the amount of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension commitments takes into account country-specific supervisory and tax regulations.\n\nIn some countries, pension benefits were granted for which the employer has a subsidiary liability. Pension benefits in a number of countries include minimum interest guarantees to a limited extent. If the pension fund cannot generate the income needed to provide the minimum guarantee, this must be provided by the employer under the subsidiary liability. To the extent that recourse to the employer is unlikely based on the structure and execution of the pension  benefits\n\nas well as the asset situation of the pension fund, these plans are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Description of the defined benefit plans\n\nThe following section describes the typical plan structure in the individual countries. Different arrangements may exist, in particular due to the assumption of plans as part of acquisitions; however, these do not have any material impact on the description of plans in the individual countries.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor BASF/uni00A0 SE and German Group companies, a basic level of benefits  is  provided  by  BASF  Pensionskasse/uni00A0 VVaG,  a  legally independent plan, which is financed by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. BASF/uni00A0SE ensures the  necessary  contributions  to  adequately  finance  the  benefits promised by BASF/uni00A0 Pensionskasse VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via BASF Pensionskasse/uni00A0VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the regulations imposed by the German supervisory authority. In 2004, the basic benefit plan was closed for newly hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a defined contribution plan.  A  new  defined  contribution  plan  was  introduced  as  of July/uni00A0 1,/uni00A0 2021, for new hires in the German BASF companies. At BASF/uni00A0 SE, occupational pension promises that exceed the basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual trust arrangement by BASF Pensionstreuhand/uni00A0 e.V.; at German Group companies, these benefits are financed primarily via pension provisions. As of 2022, new employees receive a securities-based pension award while other employees are granted benefits primarily based on cash balance plans. Furthermore, employees are given the option of participating in various deferred compensation schemes.",

        "page_content": "## United States\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nEmployees  are  granted  benefits  based  on  defined  contribution plans.\n\nEffective 2010, the existing defined benefit plans were closed to further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and benefits earned in the past were frozen. There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases.\n\nThe legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary to meet the minimum funding level are based on the results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA requirements.\n\nAdditional  similar  obligations  arise  from  plans  that  assume  the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees and their dependents. Such plans have been closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of the benefits for such plans has been frozen.\n\n## Switzerland\n\nThe employees of the BASF/uni00A0Group in Switzerland receive a  company pension, which is financed through a pension fund by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. The pension plans are accounted for as defined benefit plans, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law under the Swiss Pension Fund Act (BVG) is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately. According to government regulations, the employer is obligated to make contributions, so that the pension funds are able to grant the minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The pension funds are managed by boards, where employer and employees are equally represented, which steer and monitor the benefit plans and asset allocation.\n\nEmployees are granted benefits based on a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe BASF Group also maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which have been closed for further increases based on future years of service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in the cost of living until the beginning of retirement are legally required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit plans are administered by a trust company, whose Board of Trustees, according to the trustee  agreement  and  law,  represents  the  interests  of  the beneficiaries and ensures that the benefits can be paid in the future. The  required  funding  is  determined  using  technical  valuations according to local regulations every three years.\n\n## Other countries\n\nFor  Group  companies  in  other  countries,  defined  benefits  are covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly by external insurance companies or pension funds.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation is based on the following key assumptions:\n\n## Assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligation as of December/uni00A031\n\n|                             |   Germany |   Germany | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United  Kingdom |   United  Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             |    2022   |    2021   | 2022            | 2021            | 2022          | 2021          |            2022   |            2021   |\n| Discount rate               |       3.7 |       1.1 | 5.30            | 2.70            | 2.20          | 0.40          |               4.8 |               2   |\n| Projected pension  increase |       2.2 |       1.6 | -               | -               | -             | -             |               3.4 |               3.5 |\n\nAssumptions used to determine expenses for pension benefits in the respective business year\n\n|                             |   Germany |   Germany | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United  Kingdom |   United  Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             |    2022   |    2021   | 2022            | 2021            | 2022          | 2021          |            2022   |            2021   |\n| Discount rate               |       1.1 |       0.7 | 2.70            | 2.30            | 0.40          | 0.10          |               2   |               1.5 |\n| Projected pension  increase |       1.6 |       1.5 | -               | -               | -             | -             |               3.5 |               3.1 |\n\nThe assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation as of December/uni00A0 31 are used in the following year to determine the expenses for pension plans.\n\nA  Group-wide,  uniform  procedure  has  thus  far  been  used  to determine  the  discount  rates  applied  for  valuation  of  material pension obligations of the BASF/uni00A0Group. Accordingly, the discount rates  were  derived  from  the  yields  on  corporate  bonds  in  the respective  currency  zones  with  an  issue  volume  of  more  than 100/uni00A0million units of the respective currency with a minimum rating of AA- to AA+ from at least one of the following three rating agencies: Fitch, Moody's, or Standard & Poor's. For the determination of material  pension  obligations  in  Germany,  the  United  States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, BASF began using a standard model, the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link model, to measure",

At Group level, the new approach  led  to  a  rise  in  obligations  of  \u20ac664/uni00A0 million,  primarily attributable to pension plans in Germany. The use of the previous approach would have resulted in an increase to the discount rate of 30 basis points for Germany.\n\nThe majority of domestic pension obligations are subject to legally required regular adjustments based on interim inflation developments. An inflation rate of 10% was applied for 2022. The long-term inflation assumption was adjusted in 2022 from 1.60% to 2.20%.\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation is generally performed using the most recent actuarial mortality tables as of December/uni00A031 of the respective business year; these were last updated in 2019 for the pension obligations in Germany and in 2021 for the pension obligations in Switzerland.

Accordingly,  plan  assets  are aligned with the long-term development of the obligations, taking into  consideration  the  risks  associated  with  the  specific  asset classes and the regulations relating to the investment of plan assets. The  existing  portfolio  structure  is  based  on  the  target  asset allocation. In addition, current market assessments are taken into consideration. In order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a widely spread global portfolio of individual assets is held.\n\nLiability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as hedging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used in some pension plans, especially for U.K. and U.S. plans.\n\n## Structure of plan assets\n\n%\n\n|                                 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equities                        |     21 |     26 |\n| Debt instruments                |     42 |     45 |\n| of which for government debtors |     16 |     18 |\n| for other debtors               |     26 |     27 |\n| Real estate                     |      7 |      6 |\n| Alternative investments         |     29 |     21 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       |      1 |      2 |\n| Total                           |    100 |    100 |\n\nThe asset class debt instruments comprises promissory notes and debentures  (Pfandbriefe)  as  well  as  corporate  and  government bonds. Government bonds primarily relate to bonds from countries with very high credit ratings, such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  Germany  and  Switzerland.  Government  bonds  from emerging countries are also held to a limited extent. Corporate bonds mainly comprise bonds from creditworthy debtors, although particular high-yield bonds are also held to a limited extent. In connection with the continuous monitoring of default risk based on a given risk budget and on the observation of the development of the creditworthiness of issuers, the plan asset allocation may be adjusted in the case of a revised market assessment. Alternative investments largely comprise investments in private and\n\ninfrastructure  equity,  absolute  return  funds  and  senior  secured loans.\n\nAlmost all of the equities are priced on active markets. The  category debt  instruments includes  promissory  notes  and  debentures (Pfandbriefe) acquired through private placements with a market value in the amount of \u20ac138/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022, and \u20ac188/uni00A0 million  as  of  December/uni00A0 31,  2021.  For  such  securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. There is also no fungible market price for the additional amount of \u20ac3,731/uni00A0million, especially in the category of alternative investments and real estate . The capital market compensates for this lack of fungibility with yield premiums depending on the  maturity.\n\nPlan assets as of the balance sheet date contained securities issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of \u20ac0/uni00A0million in 2022 and \u20ac0/uni00A0million in 2021. The market value of the properties of legally independent pension funds rented to BASF Group companies was \u20ac115/uni00A0million compared with \u20ac112/uni00A0million in the previous year.\n\nTo enable Pensionskasse/uni00A0VVaG to meet future regulatory solvency requirements and strengthen its risk-bearing capacity, BASF/uni00A0 SE temporarily provided the pension fund with capital in the form of a retrospective initial fund loan with a nominal value of \u20ac220/uni00A0million in 2021; the pension fund utilized \u20ac80 million of that amount in the same year on a one-time basis  in order to repay the existing profit participation capital.  The initial fund loan was increased to a nominal value of \u20ac320/uni00A0million in 2022.",

A plan asset surplus exists if a defined benefit plan's assets exceed the plan's obligations. IAS 19 requires the employer to test any such surplus for impairment. If no economic benefit (for example, reduced contributions or a refund) to the company is present, an asset ceiling must be reported.\n\n## Defined contribution plans and government pensions\n\nThe contributions to defined contribution plans recognized in income from operations amounted to \u20ac344 million in 2022 and \u20ac308/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\nContributions to government pension plans were \u20ac601/uni00A0 million in 2022 and \u20ac578/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\n## 23 Other provisions\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOther provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event and when there is a probable outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value.\n\nProvisions for environmental protection and remediation costs are recognized for expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination at existing production or storage sites, and for similar measures as well as for obligations to surrender emission certificates.\n\nIn  addition,  other  provisions  also  cover  expected  costs  for restoration  obligations for dismantling  existing  plants  and buildings. If BASF is the only responsible party that can be identified, the   provision  covers  the  entire  expected  obligation.  At  sites operated  together  with  one  or  more  partners,  the  provision generally covers only BASF's share of the expected obligation. The amount  of  the  provision  is  determined  based  on  the  available technical  information  on  the  site,  the  technology  used,  legal regulations, and official  requirements. The calculation accounts for expected significant changes in obligations.\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures include severance payments to departing employees or similar personnel expenses as well as expected costs for site closures, including costs for demolition and similar measures. Provisions are recognized for these expenses when the relevant measures have been planned and announced by management.\n\nProvisions for employee obligations primarily consist of variable compensation including associated social security contributions, as well as obligations for granting long-service bonuses. The latter are predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles.\n\nProvisions for obligations from sales and purchase contracts largely comprise obligations arising from rebates granted and other price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment, warranties and product liabilities, sales commissions and losses from onerous contracts.\n\nProvisions for litigation, damage claims, warranties and similar obligations contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant party, as well as obligations under damage claims against BASF and fines. In order to determine the amount of the  provisions,  the  company  takes  into  consideration  the  facts related to each case, the size of the claim, compensation awarded in  similar  cases  and  independent  expert  advice  as  well  as assumptions regarding the probability of a successful claim and the range  of  possible  claims.  Actual  costs  can  deviate  from  these estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see Note/uni00A024 on page 268",

        "page_content": "## 24 Risks from litigation and claims\n\nSince August 2019, BASF Corporation has been served in various U.S.  federal  and  state  lawsuits  alleging  property  and  resource damages and personal injuries from possible exposure to per- and polyflouroalkyl  substances  (PFAS).  In  December  2018,  a  multidistrict litigation was created to coordinate claims brought against manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) in particular, which plaintiffs allege contains toxic levels of certain PFAS compounds including perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Plaintiffs typically allege that exposure to AFFF has caused loss of use and enjoyment of property, diminished property value, remediation costs, and personal injuries including various types of cancers. The complaints name BASF as a defendant  in  connection  with  its  2009  acquisition  of  Ciba  Specialty Chemicals Inc. and the legacy Ciba/BASF Lodyne fluorochemical product lines. BASF is a defendant in over 2,200 lawsuits as of January 2023 and is defending against these claims.\n\nAt this time, BASF cannot predict the outcome of resolving these matters  or  what  potential  actions  may  be  taken  by  regulatory agencies. An adverse outcome could be material to BASF's financial results.\n\nFurthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants in or parties to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our current knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a material effect on the economic situation of BASF.\n\n## 25 Other financial obligations\n\nThe figures listed below are stated at nominal value:\n\n## Other financial obligations\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                | Dec./uni00A031,  2022   | Dec./uni00A031,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Bills of exchange                                              | 5                       | 3                       |\n| Guarantees                                                     | 41                      | 383                     |\n| Warranties                                                     | 33                      | 58                      |\n| Collateral granted on behalf of third-party liabilities        | 1                       | 1                       |\n| Initiated investment projects                                  | 13,982                  | 4,761                   |\n| of which purchase commitments                                  | 5,019                   | 1,481                   |\n| for the purchase of intangible assets                          | 10                      | 10                      |\n| Payment and loan commitments and other financial   obligations | 293                     | 263                     |\n\nBASF/uni00A0SE provides a guarantee to Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation covering all obligations of Wintershall Dea Middle East/uni00A0GmbH related to the Ghasha concession in the United Arab Emirates.

The  guarantees  do  not  stipulate  a  maximum amount. The risk of a claim being exercised against the guarantees is classified as low. The decline in guarantees resulted primarily from the fact that BASF SE's guarantees were no longer in existence for abandonment obligations of Wintershall Dea Norge/uni00A0AS for various oil and gas facilities acquired from Equinor as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe rise in obligations from initiated investment projects is mainly attributable to the construction of BASF's new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China.\n\n## Obligations arising from purchase contracts\n\nObligations  from  purchase  contracts  resulted  primarily  from long-term purchase obligations for raw materials as well as supply agreements for energy from renewable sources.

        "page_content": "## 26 Supplementary information on financial instruments\n\n## 26.1 Accounting policies\n\nFinancial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognized  in  the consolidated balance sheet when the BASF Group becomes a party to a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when BASF no longer has a contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset or when the financial asset is transferred together with all material risks and rewards of ownership and BASF does not have control of the financial asset after it has been transferred. For example, receivables are derecognized when they are definitively found  to  be  uncollectible  such  as  in  the  event  of  concluded insolvency proceedings. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligations expire, are discharged or cancelled. Regular-way  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  instruments  are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious metal trading, the trade date is used.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If pricing on an active market is available, for example in the form of exchange prices, these are used as the basis for the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based on either internal measurement models using current market parameters or external measurements, for example, from banks. These internal measurements rely predominantly on the net present value method and option pricing models. These models incorporate, for example, expected future cash  flows  as  well  as  discount  factors  adjusted  for  term  and, potentially, risk. Depending on the availability of market parameters, BASF assigns financial instruments' market values one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy pursuant to IFRS/uni00A013. Reassignment to a different level during a fiscal year is only carried out if the availability of observable market parameters for identical or similar items changes.\n\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the 'solely payments of principle and interest' criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset  portfolios.  Based  on  these  two  criteria,  BASF  uses  the following measurement categories for financial assets:\n\n- -Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include  all  financial  assets  whose  cash  flows  are  not  solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS/uni00A0 9. At BASF, derivatives, for example, are allocated to this measurement category. In general, BASF does not exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.\n- -Financial assets measured at amortized cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At BASF, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivable, as well as receivables reported under other receivables and miscellaneous assets and certain securities.\n\nInitial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition or, in the case of trade accounts receivable, to the transaction price pursuant to IFRS 15. Subsequent measurement effects  are  recognized  in  income  using  the  effective  interest method.\n\nImpairments are recognized for expected credit losses at both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event. Counterparties are generally considered to default  when  they  become  insolvent,  become  a  debtor  in  a creditor  protection  program  or  are  in  a  finance-related  legal dispute  with  BASF,  or  more  than  half  of  BASF's  receivables\n\nportfolio with them is more than 90/uni00A0days overdue. In these cases, individual impairments are recognized for the financial assets measured at amortized cost that are then considered to be credit impaired.\n\nThe extent of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally recognized over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments  are  generally  only  recognized  as  12-month  expected credit  losses.  By  contrast,  under  the  simplified  approach  for determining  expected  credit  losses  permitted  by  IFRS/uni00A0 9, impairments for receivables such as lease receivables and trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned.\n\nAt BASF, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal  information  and  external  rating  information  on  the respective counterparty. A significant increase in the counterparty's credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. It is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly.\n\nRegional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the extent of impairment as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual impairments. In addition, BASF uses internal and  external  ratings  and  the  assessments  of  debt  collection agencies and credit insurers, when available. Individual impairments are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at  amortized cost, are likewise considered when calculating  impairments. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected credit losses and individual  impairments are only calculated for those receivables that are not covered by insurance or other  collateral.  Impairments  on   receivables  whose  insurance includes a deductible are not  recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible.",

Reversals  of impairments may not exceed amortized cost, less any expected future credit losses.\n\n- -Financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive  income include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount outstanding, in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9. Furthermore, the assets in this measurement category may not just  be  held  with  the  intention  of  collecting  the  expected contractual cash flows over their term, but also generating cash flows from their sale. At BASF, certain securities that are reported as other financial assets or marketable securities are allocated to this category. BASF does not exercise the option to  subsequently measure  equity  instruments  through  other  comprehensive income.\n\nAssets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value,  which  usually corresponds to the transaction price of the securities allocated to this category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of.\n\nImpairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe  following  measurement  categories  are  used  for  financial liabilities:\n\n- -Financial  liabilities  measured  at  amortized  cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost using the effective interest method. At BASF, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial indebtedness are measured at amortized cost.\n- -Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss contain  derivative  financial  liabilities.  These  are  likewise measured at the value of the consideration received as the fair value of the liability on the date of initial recognition. Fair value is also  applied  as  a  measurement  basis  for  these  liabilities  in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised. Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS policies require separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS/uni00A0 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety .\n\nFinancial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts that require compensation payments to be made to the guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms of a transaction entered into with the holder of the guarantee. Financial guarantees issued by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In subsequent periods, these financial guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\nIn cash flow hedges , future cash flows and the related income and expenses are hedged against the risk of changes in fair value. To this end, future underlying transactions and the corresponding hedging instruments  are  designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting relationship for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which often meets the definition of a derivative, and the cost of hedging are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income over the term of the hedge, taking deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case of future transactions that lead to recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge in equity are generally charged against the cost of the hedged item on its initial recognition. For hedges based on financial assets, financial liabilities or future transactions, cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. The maturity of the hedging instrument is aligned with the effective date of the future transaction.\n\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is used, the asset or liability recognized is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. The hedging instruments used, which often take the form of a derivative, are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income. The carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities designated as the underlying transaction are also measured at fair value through the statement of income.",

This only refers to transactions in U.S. dollars in both years.\n\n## Market risks\n\nForeign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could lead to losses in the value of financial instruments and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing rate of financial receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  respective  Group company. Foreign currency contracts in various currencies are used to  hedge  foreign  exchange  risks  from  nonderivative  financial instruments and planned transactions.\n\nThe foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed to currency risks. In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the respective following year are included if they fall under the currency risk management system. Long and short positions in the same currency are offset against each other.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a 5% and 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the other currencies. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional currency would  have  reduced  BASF's  income  before  income  taxes  by \u20ac156/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022. A 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency would have resulted in a negative effect on BASF's income before income taxes in the amount of \u20ac293/uni00A0million. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional  currency would have resulted in a negative effect on BASF's income before income taxes in the amount of \u20ac174/uni00A0million (-\u20ac326/uni00A0million applying 10% appreciation) as of December/uni00A031, 2021. The effect from the items designated under hedge accounting would have  increased shareholders' equity before income taxes by \u20ac15/uni00A0 million applying 5% appreciation to the functional currency, and increased it by \u20ac32/uni00A0million applying 10% appreciation to the functional  currency as of December 31, 2022 (2021: reduction of \u20ac3/uni00A0million applying 5% appreciation to the functional currency and increase of \u20ac2/uni00A0 million\n\n## Exposure and sensitivity by currency\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|       | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|       | Exposure                   | Sensitivity                | Sensitivity                | Exposure                   | Sensitivity                | Sensitivity                |\n|       |                            | +5%                        | +10%                       |                            | +5%                        | +10%                       |\n| USD   | 1,643                      | -93                        | -170                       | 1,712                      | -128                       | -231                       |\n| Other | 987                        | -47                        | -90                        | 1,011                      | -49                        | -94                        |\n| Total | 2,630                      | -141                       | -260                       | 2,723                      | -177                       | -324                       |\n\nDue to the use of options to hedge currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is not a linear function of the assumed changes in exchange rates.\n\nInterest rate risks: Interest rate risks arise from changes in  prevailing market interest rates, which can lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments and in interest payments for variable-rate instruments. Interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases to hedge these risks. The derivatives are presented in Note 26.5. Interest rate risks are relevant to BASF's financing activities but are not of material significance for BASF's operating activities.\n\nThe variable interest risk exposure, which also includes fixed rate bonds maturing in the following year, amounted to -\u20ac2,441/uni00A0 million /uni00A0 as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (2021: -\u20ac2,408 million). An increase in all relevant interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac7/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A031, 2022. An increase in all relevant interest rates by one percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac15/uni00A0million as of the same date. An increase in all relevant interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac4/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A0 31,/uni00A0 2021 (an increase of one percentage point would have lowered income  before income taxes by \u20ac9/uni00A0million). Because no interest derivatives were designated  in  hedge  accounting  relationships  as  of  Decem-\n\n1,/uni00A02022, a change in interest rates would not have had an effect on shareholders' equity. There were also no interest derivatives designated  in  a  hedge  accounting  relationship  as  of  December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021.\n\n## Carrying amounts of nonderivative interest-bearing financial instruments Million \u20ac\n\n|                          | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                          | Fixed   interest rate      | Variable   interest rate   | Fixed   interest rate      | Variable   interest rate   |\n| Loans                    | 75                         | 92                         | 113                        | 108                        |\n| Securities               | 155                        | 208                        | 20                         | 209                        |\n| Financial   indebtedness | 16,428                     | 2,588 a                    | 14,446                     | 2,738 a                    |\n\n- a Including fixed rate bonds maturing in the following year\n\n## Nominal and fair values of combined interest rate and currency swaps\n\n## Million \u20ac\n\n|                                            | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                            | Nominal   value            | Fair   value               | Nominal   value            | Fair   value               |\n| Combined interest rate and currency  swaps | 3,427                      | 265                        | 4,183                      | 102                        |\n| of which fixed rate                        | 3,427                      | 265                        | 4,183                      | 102                        |\n\nCentral benchmark interest rates are being comprehensively revised as part of what is known as the IBOR reform.

As of December/uni00A0 31,  2022,  financial  liabilities  related  to  contracts  yet  to  be adjusted were identified in the amount of \u20ac61 million (December/uni00A031, 2021: \u20ac302/uni00A0million). These are variable-rate bank loans referenced to a USD LIBOR. Furthermore, financial assets related to contracts yet to be adjusted were identified in the amount of \u20ac43/uni00A0 million (December/uni00A0 31, 2021: \u20ac85/uni00A0 million). These are mainly short-term loans, particularly to nonconsolidated  subsidiaries,  that  are referenced  to  a  USD  LIBOR  (\u20ac43/uni00A0 million).  No  derivatives  were identified that are associated with contracts yet to be adjusted.\n\nCommodity price risks: Some of BASF's divisions are exposed to strong fluctuations in raw materials prices. These result primarily from raw materials (for example naphtha, benzene, natural gas, LPG condensate)  as  well  as  from  precious  metals.  BASF  takes  the following  measures  to  reduce  price  risks  associated  with  the purchase of raw materials:\n\n- - BASF uses derivatives to hedge the risks of raw materials prices. These are primarily options on crude oil, oil products and natural gas.\n- - The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and long-term purchase  contracts  with  precious  metal  and  battery  metal producers. It also buys precious metals on spot markets from various business partners. The price risk from metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts  and  battery  materials,  is  hedged  using  derivative instruments. This is mainly performed using forward contracts, which are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the precious metal.\n- - In the Agricultural Solutions division, the sales prices of products are  sometimes  pegged  to  the  price  of  certain  agricultural commodities. To hedge the resulting risks, derivatives on agricultural commodities are concluded.\n\nIn addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for trading on its own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring.\n\nBy  holding  commodity  derivatives  and  precious  metal  trading positions,  BASF  is  exposed  to  price  risks.  The  valuation  of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions at fair value  means  that  adverse  changes  in  market  prices  could negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF.\n\nBASF holds several physical power purchase agreements (physical PPAs) with terms of up to 25/uni00A0years. Under the physical PPAs, BASF procures  electricity  and  associated  green  electricity  certificates, known as guarantees of origin (GoOs). The physical PPAs are  eligible for the own use exemption and are therefore not recognized as derivatives in the balance sheet even when electricity and green electricity certificates are purchased at a fixed price.\n\nFurthermore, BASF holds several virtual power purchase  agreements (virtual PPAs) in the United States with terms of up to 15/uni00A0years. The virtual PPAs contain embedded contracts for difference for electricity prices that are recognized separately as derivatives at fair value through profit or loss. In the event of adverse changes in electricity market prices, valuation of the contracts for difference for electricity prices at fair value can lead to negative effects on earnings and equity of BASF.\n\nBASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions. Value at risk continuously measures the market price risk and quantifies the loss that is not exceeded by a specific confidence level during a defined holding period. BASF bases the value-at-risk calculation on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of one day. BASF applies the variance-covariance method to calculate value at risk.\n\nBASF uses value at risk in conjunction with other risk management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume-based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.\n\n## Exposure due to commodity derivatives\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                    | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                    | Exposure                   | Value at risk              | Exposure                   | Value at risk              |\n| Crude oil,   oil products and  natural gas         | 388                        | 23                         | 97                         | 18                         |\n| Precious metals                                    | 46                         | 2                          | 51                         | 1                          |\n| Agricultural   commodities                         | 87                         | 0                          | 58                         | 0                          |\n| Electricity and   green electricity   certificates | 228                        | 4                          | 388                        | 7                          |\n\nThe exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and short positions of the respective commodity category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BASF's financial risks and risk management, see Opportunities and Risks from page/uni00A0157 onward\n\n## Default and credit risk\n\nDefault and credit risks arise when customers and debtors do not fulfill  their  contractual  obligations.

The carrying amount of all receivables, loans  and  interest-bearing  securities  plus  the  nominal  value  of financial obligations stemming from contingent liabilities not to be recognized represents the maximum default risk for BASF.\n\nFor more information on credit risks, see Note/uni00A018 from page 252 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nBASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of liquidity planning.

The expected capacity of the solar power plants in Texas, United States, is 250/uni00A0megawatts. The  solar  parks  are  scheduled  to  go  into  operation  in  2023 (50/uni00A0megawatts) and 2024 (200 megawatts). The level 3 fair value is determined as the present value of the expected cash flows from the contracts for difference for electricity prices. The key valuation parameters  are  the  expected  electricity  prices  and  expected production volumes as well as expected startup date. A change in the key valuation parameters as of December/uni00A031, 2022, would have affected the fair value of the contracts for difference for electricity prices as follows:\n\nAt the time of initial recognition, the fair values of the contracts for difference  for  electricity  prices,  which  were  calculated  using  a valuation model, were higher than the respective transaction prices of zero. As these are level 3 fair values, the differences are deferred and reported in the balance sheet together with the positive or negative  fair  value  of  the  respective  contract  for  difference  for electricity prices, according to the valuation model. The differences are amortized over the terms of the contracts using the straight-line method.\n\nAs of January/uni00A01, 2022, the difference yet to be amortized in profit or loss from a virtual PPA signed in the previous year amounted to \u20ac12/uni00A0 million. Further PPAs signed in 2022 resulted in differences of \u20ac61/uni00A0 million.  In  2022,  differences  amounting  to  \u20ac3/uni00A0 million  were amortized in profit or loss and recognized as other operating income in the income statement. After proportional amortization, differences yet to be amortized in profit or loss remained in the amount of \u20ac70/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nThe carrying amount of the virtual PPA signed in the previous year reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities was \u20ac1/uni00A0million as of January/uni00A01, 2022, after subtracting the difference of \u20ac12/uni00A0million.

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac539/uni00A0million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 26.1 from page 269 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n- g The carrying amount of the contract for difference for electricity prices reported in the balance sheet under other receivables and miscellaneous assets is \u20ac8/uni00A0million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac24/uni00A0million described on page 274.\n- h The carrying amount of the contract for difference for electricity prices reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities is \u20ac17/uni00A0million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac46/uni00A0million described on page 274.",

Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 26.1 from page 269 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n- g The carrying amount of the physical PPAs reported in the balance sheet under assets of disposal groups is \u20ac71/uni00A0million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac14/uni00A0million and -\u20ac5/uni00A0million.\n- h The carrying amount of the contract for difference for electricity prices reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities is \u20ac1/uni00A0million after subtracting the difference of \u20ac12/uni00A0million.",

For positive fair values of combined interest rate and currency swaps, the respective counterparties provided cash collaterals in an amount comparable to the outstanding fair values.\n\nDeviations  from  the  derivatives  with  positive  fair  values  and derivatives with negative fair values reported in other receivables and  other  liabilities  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021  arose  from derivatives not subject to any netting agreements. These are not included in the table above.\n\nIn addition to the offsetting of derivatives presented in the table above, trade accounts receivable in 2022 were offset against trade accounts payable and advance payments received on orders, which were included in current other liabilities, provided specific netting agreements with customers existed. As a result, trade accounts receivable were reduced by \u20ac992 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac103/uni00A0million and the reduction in advance\n\npayments received on orders was \u20ac889/uni00A0million. Accordingly, the net amount for trade accounts receivable was \u20ac12,055 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac13,047/uni00A0million). The resulting net amount for trade accounts payable was \u20ac8,434 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac8,537/uni00A0 million). The net amount for advance payments received on orders was \u20ac926 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,815/uni00A0million). In 2021, trade accounts receivable were also offset against trade accounts payable and the advance payments received on orders included in current other liabilities. This reduced trade accounts receivable by \u20ac805 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac36/uni00A0 million and the reduction in advance payments received on orders was \u20ac769/uni00A0million. Accordingly, the net amount for trade accounts receivable was \u20ac11,942 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac12,747/uni00A0 million). The resulting net amount for trade accounts payable was \u20ac7,826 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac7,862/uni00A0 million).

These risks are hedged using derivative instruments as necessary in accordance with  a  centrally  determined  strategy.  Hedging  is  employed  for existing underlying transactions from the product business, cash investments and financing as well as for planned sales, raw material s purchases and capital measures. Furthermore, hedging may also be used for cash flows from acquisitions and divestitures. The risks from the hedged items and the derivatives are continually monitored. Where derivatives have a positive market value, BASF is exposed to credit risks from derivative transactions in the event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize the default risk on derivatives with positive market values, transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy banks and partners and are subject to predefined credit limits.\n\n## Fair value of derivative instruments\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                                 |   December/uni00A031, 2022 | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Foreign currency forward contracts                                              |                        165 | 21                         |\n| Foreign currency options                                                        |                         19 | 1                          |\n| Foreign currency derivatives                                                    |                        184 | 22                         |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) |                         16 | 0                          |\n| Combined interest rate and currency swaps                                       |                        265 | 102                        |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) |                        256 | 179                        |\n| Interest derivatives                                                            |                        265 | 102                        |\n| Commodity derivatives                                                           |                        511 | 324                        |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) |                         45 | 107  a                     |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                |                        960 | 447                        |\n\n- a Of which \u20ac71 million reported in the balance sheet under assets of disposal groups\n\nTo ensure efficient risk management, risk positions are centralized at BASF  SE  and  certain  Group  companies.  The  contracting  and execution of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal guidelines, and subject to strict control mechanisms.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using  valuation  models  that,  if  available,  use  input  parameters observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on market prices.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nBASF is exposed to commodity price risks in the context of procuring naphtha. Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using options on oil and oil products. The main contractual elements of these items are aligned with the characteristics of the hedged item. Cash flow hedge accounting was employed for a portion of these hedging relationships in 2022 and 2021. The average exercise price of the designated options was $737.71 per metric ton as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (December/uni00A031, 2021: $675.54 per metric ton). Cash  flows  from  designated  hedging  instruments  and  hedged transactions occur in the following year and are also recognized in profit or loss for that year.\n\nFurthermore, cash flow hedge accounting continued to be employed to a minor extent for procuring natural gas, which is likewise  exposed to commodity price risks. Commodity price-based options serve as hedging instruments, for which contract terms are defined to reflect the risks of the hedged item. Depending on where trading took place, the average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac71.36 per MWh or $5.00 per mmBtu as of December/uni00A031, 2022. The average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac32.60 per MWh or $3.74 per mmBtu as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021. Cash flows from the hedging transaction and hedged item are generally recognized in profit or loss for 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe change in the options' time value is recognized separately in equity as costs of transaction-related hedging and, in the year during which the hedged items mature, it is initially derecognized against the carrying amount of the procured assets and recognized in profit or loss when the assets are consumed. In 2022, a decrease in fair value of \u20ac60 million was recognized in equity, and \u20ac49 million was  initially  derecognized  against  the  carrying  amount  of  the inventories procured and then recognized upon consumption in profit or loss. In 2021, a decrease in fair value of \u20ac27 million was recognized as a reduction in equity, and \u20ac24 million was derecognized against the carrying amount of the assets.",

        "page_content": "Due to planned sales in U.S. dollars, BASF is exposed to foreign currency risks, which are partially hedged with currency options and designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  relationship.  The hedged transaction - the designated share of expected sales in U.S./uni00A0dollars - is calculated based on internal thresholds. The hedged volume is always below the total amount of expected sales in U.S./uni00A0 dollars for the following fiscal year. The average hedged rate was $1.0255 per euro as of December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, and $1.1630 per euro in the previous year. The impact on earnings from designated transactions in 2022 will be recognized in the following year. The decrease in the options' time value component arising in the amount of \u20ac8 million in 2022 was recognized separately in equity as the cost of hedging and resulted in a reduction in equity. Due to the maturity of hedged items, accumulated changes in the options' time values were reclassified as a reduction in earnings in the amount of  \u20ac9/uni00A0million. In the previous year, \u20ac14/uni00A0million was recognized as a change in the options' time value component, thereby reducing equity; and \u20ac19/uni00A0million was reclassified as a reduction in earnings.\n\nFurthermore,  BASF  SE's  fixed-rate  U.S.  private  placement  of $1.25/uni00A0 billion,  issued  in  2013,  was  converted  to  euros  using cross-currency swaps, as the private placement exposes BASF to a combined  interest/currency  risk.  The  hedged  interest  rate  was 4.13% in the fiscal years 2022 and 2021. The hedged foreign exchange rate in both years was $1.3589 per euro. This hedge was designated as a cash flow hedge.\n\nFurthermore, BASF was exposed to foreign currency risks in 2022 through U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. These risks are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts and designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. The average hedged rate was $1.0683 per euro as of December/uni00A0 31,/uni00A0 2022. In 2022, the changes in value in the amount of \u20ac30/uni00A0 million resulting from the change in the forward rate were recognized separately in equity as hedging costs, leading to an increase in equity (2021: \u20ac11/uni00A0million). Of accumulated hedging costs in equity, the amount of \u20ac30/uni00A0million was  reclassified  in  2022  as  time-period-related  hedging  costs, increasing earnings (2021: \u20ac11/uni00A0million). There was no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\nThe effects of the hedging relationships on the balance sheet, the cash flow hedge reserve, hedged nominal value and ineffectiveness to be determined are presented in the following tables by fiscal year.",

        "page_content": "The occurrence of all forecasted transactions was considered to be highly probable at all times during fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve for commodity price risks are derecognized against the carrying amount of acquired assets once the hedged transaction occurs. Thus, there is no immediate reclassification of the amounts recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss in these cases.\n\n## 27 Capital structure management and statement of cash flows\n\n## Capital structure management\n\nThe aim of capital structure management is to maintain the financial flexibility needed to further develop BASF's business portfolio and take advantage of strategic opportunities. The objectives of the company's financing policy are to ensure solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.\n\nCapital structure management focuses on meeting the requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to the capital market and a solid A rating. The capital structure is managed using selected financial ratios, such as dynamic debt ratios, as part of the  company's financial planning.\n\nThe equity of the BASF/uni00A0 Group as reported in the balance sheet amounted to \u20ac40,923/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A0 31, 2022 (December/uni00A0 31, 2021: \u20ac42,081/uni00A0 million); the equity ratio was 48.4% on December/uni00A031, 2022 (December/uni00A031, 2021: 48.2%).\n\nBASF prefers to access external financing on the capital markets. A commercial paper program is used for short-term financing, while corporate bonds are used for financing in the medium and long term. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, achieve a  diverse  range  of  investors  and  optimize  BASF's  debt  capital financing  conditions.  Since  2020,  BASF  has  employed  green corporate  bonds  to  finance  the  development  of  sustainable products and projects with a clear environmental benefit.\n\nBASF currently has the following ratings, which were most recently confirmed by Fitch on November/uni00A0 30, 2022, and by Moody's on January/uni00A018, 2023. Standard & Poor's confirmed BASF's A rating on August/uni00A01, 2022, and adjusted its outlook from stable to negative.\n\n## Ratings as of December/uni00A031, 2022\n\n|                          | Noncurrent   financial   indebtedness   | Current   financial   indebtedness   | Outlook   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Fitch                    | A                                       | F1                                   | stable    |\n| Moody's                  | A3                                      | P-2                                  | stable    |\n| Standard/uni00A0& Poor's | A                                       | A-1                                  | negative  |\n\n## Ratings as of December/uni00A031, 2021\n\n|                          | Noncurrent   financial   indebtedness   | Current   financial   indebtedness   | Outlook   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Fitch                    | A                                       | F1                                   | stable    |\n| Moody's                  | A3                                      | P-2                                  | stable    |\n| Standard/uni00A0& Poor's | A                                       | A-1                                  | stable    |\n\nBASF strives to maintain a solid A rating, which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets.\n\nFor more information on BASF's financing policy, see the Management's Report from page 64/uni00A0onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cash flows resulting from the sale and repurchase in the amount of \u20ac502/uni00A0 million were reported in cash flows from operating  activities.\n\nIn 2022, cash flows from investing activities included \u20ac13/uni00A0million in payments  made  for  acquisitions.  These  related  to  an  adjusted purchase price payment for Solvay's polyamide business (2021: \u20ac600/uni00A0 million  for  the  acquisition  of  BASF  Shanshan  Battery Materials/uni00A0Co.,/uni00A0Ltd).\n\nPayments received from divestitures in the amount of \u20ac691/uni00A0million resulted primarily from the sale of shares in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm in the amount of \u20ac382/uni00A0 million, the sale of the kaolin minerals business in the amount of \u20ac225/uni00A0million, and the sale of the production  site  in  Quincy,  Florida,  and  associated  attapulgite business  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac60/uni00A0 million.  Payments  received  for divestitures in the amount of \u20ac1,030/uni00A0 million in 2021 were mainly from the sale of the pigments business.\n\nFor more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page 216 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac4,375/uni00A0million, \u20ac843/uni00A0million higher than in the previous year.\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac2,516/uni00A0million consist primarily of cash on hand and bank balances with maturities of less than three months. As in the previous year, these were not subject to any utilization restrictions in 2022. However, the repayment of funds from Russia is currently only possible to a limited extent.\n\nThe reconciliation according to IAS/uni00A07 breaks down the changes in financial and similar liabilities and their hedging transactions into cash-effective and non-cash-effective changes. The cash-effective changes presented on the left correspond to the figures in cash flows from financing activities.\n\nLoan liabilities do not contain any interest components.\n\nOther financing-related liabilities primarily comprise liabilities from accounts used for cash pooling with BASF companies not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. They are reported in miscellaneous liabilities within the balance sheet item other liabilities that qualify as financial instruments.\n\nAssets/liabilities  from  hedging  transactions form  part  of  the balance sheet items derivatives with positive and negative fair values respectively and include only those transactions which hedge risks arising from financial indebtedness and financing-related liabilities secured by micro hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on receivables and miscellaneous assets, see Note/uni00A018 from page 252 onward For more information on liabilities, see Note/uni00A021 from page/uni00A0257 onward\n\nFor more information on the statement of cash flows, see the Management's Report from page/uni00A065 onward",

        "page_content": "## Number of employees\n\nThe average number of employees was distributed over the regions as follows:\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the number of employees increased to 111,481/uni00A0 employees  compared  with  111,047/uni00A0 employees  as  of December/uni00A031, 2021. The rise was primarily due to staff increases in Asia Pacific, especially for the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. Furthermore, the Global Business Services unit contributed to a rise in  Germany,  Asia  Pacific  and  South  America.  In  addition,  the investment project to expand infrastructure and production plants for battery materials at the Schwarzheide site in Germany led to a rise  in  the  number  of  employees.  The  divestiture  of  the  kaolin minerals  business  and  the  suspension  of  business  activities  in Russia had an offsetting impact.\n\nEmployees  of  joint  operations  are  included  in  the  number  of employees relative to BASF's share in the company. As of December/uni00A031, 2022, a total of 1,196 employees (2021: 1,175 employees) worked at joint operations.\n\nThe development of the number of employees in the BASF Group was distributed over the regions as follows:\n\n## Number of employees as of December/uni00A031\n\n|                                    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 67,958  | 67,532  |\n| of which Germany                   | 51,703  | 51,026  |\n| North America                      | 16,036  | 16,753  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 20,452  | 19,976  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 7,035   | 6,786   |\n| BASF Group                         | 111,481 | 111,047 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 3,049   | 3,028   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,468   | 2,329   |\n\n## Average number of employees\n\n|                                    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 67,621  | 67,788  |\n| of which Germany                   | 51,174  | 51,144  |\n| North America                      | 16,452  | 16,765  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 20,036  | 18,464  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 6,914   | 6,799   |\n| BASF Group                         | 111,023 | 109,815 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 2,711   | 2,750   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,642   | 2,400   |\n\nThe average number of employees increased to 111,023/uni00A0employees in 2022 (2021: 109,815 employees).\n\nThe reasons for the development of the number of employees as described above are also decisive to the rise in average number of employees. Furthermore, the formation of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. as of August/uni00A031, 2021, had an increasing effect, and the divestiture of the pigments business as of June/uni00A030, 2021, had a reducing effect.\n\nOn average, 1,188/uni00A0 employees worked at joint operations (2021: 1,143/uni00A0employees).\n\nFor more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note/uni00A03 from page/uni00A0216 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs and BASF incentive share program\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs\n\nIn 2022, the BASF/uni00A0Group continued offering its share price-based compensation  program  (the  long-term  incentive  (LTI)  program), known as Strive!, which was launched in 2020. The share pricebased  compensation  program  known  as  'BOP'  (BASF  Option Program), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020. All option rights granted during the BOP program years remain valid until the end of their respective exercise periods.\n\nGenerally, members of the Board of Executive Directors and all senior executives are entitled to participate in the LTI programs.\n\n## Strive!\n\nStrive! is based on a performance share plan and takes into account the achievement of strategic goals and the development of the BASF share and dividend (total shareholder return) over a period of four years.\n\nParticipation in Strive! is voluntary for senior executives and is linked to  a  share  ownership  obligation.  Strive!  offers  rolling  eligibility, without a deadline for participation. Approximately 708/uni00A0people were eligible to participate in Strive! in 2022. About 94% of eligible senior executives and the Members of the Board of Executive Directors participated.  Unlike  for  senior  executives,  participation  is  not voluntary for the members of the Board of Executive Directors and is outlined in their service contracts. The same plan conditions generally apply to members of the Board of Executive Directors.",

        "page_content": "A Strive! plan includes a four-year performance period with a fixed disbursement date. A target amount is determined at the beginning of each new Strive! plan for every participant. This target amount is converted into a preliminary number of virtual performance share units (PSUs) by dividing it by the average BASF share price in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The number of PSUs that are ultimately paid out at the end of the performance periods depends on the achievement of the three strategic targets: growth (volume growth  compared  with  global  chemical  production),  profitability (increase in EBITDA before special items) and sustainability  (CO2 emissions).\n\nAchievement of each strategic target is calculated for each year of the four-year performance period. Upon conclusion of the performance period, the average degree of target achievement for each strategic goal is equal to the arithmetic mean of the degrees of target achievement for the four years. The total target achievement for the respective Strive! plan is determined by adding the target achievement degree for the three strategic targets after having multiplied each by the corresponding weighting factor. To calculate the final number of PSUs, this weighted target achievement is multiplied by the  preliminary  number  of  PSUs.  The  payment  amount  upon conclusion of the four-year performance period is calculated by multiplying the final number of PSUs by the average BASF share price for the fourth quarter of the last year of the performance  period, plus the accumulated dividend payments in the four fiscal years. The payment occurs in May of the following year and is capped at 200% of  the  target  amount.  The  payment  amount  therefore  not  only reflects achievement of the strategic targets, but performance of BASF's dividend and share price as well (total shareholder return).\n\nA personal investment in BASF shares is the prerequisite for participation in Strive!. Participants are required to own BASF shares amounting to a predetermined percentage of their base salary for the duration of the performance period. A set-up phase applies to first-time participants. During this period, they are required to hold a percentage of shares as their predetermined personal investment. The set-up phase for the 2022 Strive! program ends on December/uni00A031, 2025. The 2022 Strive! program has the same fundamental structure as the Strive! programs in previous years.\n\n## Fair value of PSUs and parameters used as of December 31, 2022\n\n|                                        |    | Strive! program of the   year   | Strive! program of the   year   | Strive! program of the   year   |\n|----------------------------------------|----|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                        |    | 2022                            | 2021                            | 2020                            |\n| Number of PSUs granted                 |    | 848,367                         | 823,760                         | 658,814                         |\n| Number of PSUs vested                  |    | 212,092                         | 411,880                         | 494,111                         |\n| Fair value including fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 35.99                           | 72.16                           | 64.17                           |\n| Fair value excluding fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 40.68                           | 78.30                           | 66.84                           |\n| Weighted target achievement            | %  | 83.33                           | 159.75                          | 119.75                          |\n| Base price                             | \u20ac  | 61.82                           | 57.15                           | 67.85                           |\n\nPSUs vested by the deadline were measured at fair value. Fair value is determined based on the BASF share price of \u20ac46.39 on the balance sheet date plus expected dividend payments during the term of the program and taking into account the weighted target achievement rate of the respective Strive! plan. A fluctuation rate of 4% is assumed for the fair value of senior executives' PSUs.\n\nThe LTI provision for Strive! rose from \u20ac48/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A0 31,/uni00A0 2021, to \u20ac71/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022, due to the increased number of vested PSUs. The expense from the addition of provisions totaled \u20ac23/uni00A0million in 2022 and \u20ac37/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\n## BASF Option Program (BOP)\n\nThe 'BOP' LTI program last offered in 2020, grants virtual option rights. When exercised, the option rights are settled in cash.\n\nParticipation in BOP was voluntary. In order to take part in the program,  a  participant  had  to  make  a  personal  investment: Participants  were  required  to  hold  BASF  shares  representing between 10% and 30% of their respective variable compensation for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding period). The number of shares to be held was determined by the amount of variable compensation and the volume-weighted average share price on the first trading day after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nParticipants received four option rights per invested share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B, which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met: The threshold of right/uni00A0A is met if the price of the BASF share has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base price on the option grant date (absolute threshold). The value of right A is the difference between the market price of BASF shares on the exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the base price. Right B may be exercised (relative threshold) if the cumulative percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds the percentage performance of the MSCI World Chemicals Index SM (MSCI Chemicals). The value of right/uni00A0 B is the base price of the option multiplied by twice the percentage by which the BASF share outperforms the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited to the closing price on the date of exercise less the calculated nominal value of the BASF share. Right B may only be exercised if the price of the BASF share equals at least the base price. When a two-year vesting period is over, options granted can be exercised until the end of the respective exercise period. During the exercise period, there are certain times  (closed  periods)  during  which  the  options  may  not  be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full, and one of the thresholds must be exceeded. If the other threshold is not  exceeded, the other option right lapses. A participant's maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to five times the original individual investment. Option rights are nontransferable and are forfeited if the",

        "page_content": "option holders no longer work for the BASF/uni00A0Group or have sold part of  their  individual  investment  before  the  expiry  of  the  two-year vesting period. They remain valid in the case of retirement. For the members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  the  long-term orientation  of  the  program  has  been  strengthened  significantly compared with the conditions applying to the other participants. Members of the Board of Executive Directors were required to participate in the BOP program with at least 10% of their actual annual  variable  compensation.  In  view  of  this  binding  personal investment (in the form of BASF shares), an extended holding period of four years applies. Members of the Board of Executive Directors may only exercise their option rights four years after they have been granted at the earliest (vesting period).\n\nAs a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive Directors in 2002 to settle option rights in cash, all outstanding option rights under the 2015 to 2020 programs were valued at fair value as of December/uni00A031, 2022. A proportionate provision was recognized for programs in the vesting period.\n\nThe number of outstanding options declined from 10,988,512 in 2021 to 9,328,238 in 2022, due mainly to the expiration of options from the 2014 BOP program.\n\nThe  exercisable  options  had  no  intrinsic  value  as  of  December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, or December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThe models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined using the binomial model. Volatility is determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the options.\n\nThe  LTI  provision  for  BOP  decreased  from  \u20ac110/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2021, to \u20ac64/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022, due to lower fair values and a lower number of outstanding option rights.\n\nIn  2021,  the  amount  of  \u20ac3/uni00A0 million  was  utilized  due  to  senior executives leaving the company, whereas in 2022 \u20ac1/uni00A0million was utilized due to senior executives leaving the company. Income from the reduction in provisions totaled \u20ac46/uni00A0million in 2022 and \u20ac2/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\n## BASF 'Plus' Incentive Share Program\n\nThe 'plus' incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is currently  available  to  employees  in  Germany,  other  European countries and Mexico. Simultaneous participation in both the 'plus' program and an LTI program is not permitted.\n\nEmployees who participate in BASF's 'plus' incentive share  program and acquire shares in BASF as a personal investment from their variable compensation. For every 10/uni00A0BASF shares purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at no cost after one, three, five, seven and 10/uni00A0years of holding these shares. As a rule, the first and second block of 10/uni00A0shares entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next 10/uni00A0years.\n\nThe right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant stops working for a Group company or one year after retirement. The number of free shares to be granted has developed as follows:\n\n## Number of free shares to be granted\n\nShares\n\n|                             | 2022       | 2021      |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| As of January/uni00A01      | 3,079,123  | 3,251,576 |\n| Newly acquired entitlements | 1,239,700  | 498,765   |\n| Bonus shares issued         | -478,925   | -547,960  |\n| Lapsed entitlements         | -1,342,543 | -123,258  |\n| As of December/uni00A031    | 2,497,355  | 3,079,123 |\n\nThe free shares to be provided by the company are measured at the fair value on the grant date. Fair value is determined on the basis of the BASF share price, taking into account the present value of dividends, which are not paid during the term of the program. The weighted-average fair value on the grant date amounted to \u20ac47.74 for the 2022 program, and \u20ac67.71 for the 2021/uni00A0program.\n\nThe fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in capital reserves over the term of the program.\n\nPersonnel  expenses  for  BASF's  'plus'  incentive  share  program totaled \u20ac20/uni00A0million in 2022 and \u20ac27/uni00A0million in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary and Trademarks\n\nC\n\n## CO2 equivalents\n\nCO2 equivalents (CO2e) are units for measuring the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the greenhouse effect. A factor known as the  global  warming  potential  (GWP)  shows  the  impact  of  the individual gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.\n\n## E\n\n## Eco-Efficiency Analysis\n\nThe Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for assessing the economic and environmental aspects of products and processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to profitability and environmental compatibility.\n\n## F\n\n## Formulation\n\nFormulation  describes  the  combination  of  one  or  more  active substances with excipients like emulsifiers, stabilizers and other inactive  components  in  order  to  improve  the  applicability  and effectiveness of various products, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, paints and coatings.\n\nG\n\n## Genome editing\n\nGenome editing refers to a series of new molecular biological methods  to  make  specific  changes  in  the  genome.  Naturally occurring  processes  are  used  to  make  small  changes  to  an organism's  genes  to  modify  a  specific  characteristic.  Such techniques have great potential for innovative solutions in healthcare, agriculture and industrial applications, for example.\n\nP\n\n## Peak sales potential\n\nThe  peak  sales  potential  of  the  Agricultural  Solutions  pipeline describes the total peak sales forecast for individual products in the research and development pipeline. Peak sales are the highest sales value  to  be  expected  from  one  year.  The  pipeline  comprises innovative products that have been on the market since 2022 or will be launched on the market by 2032.\n\nS\n\n## SEEbalance \u00ae\n\nSEEbalance \u00ae is  the  Socio-Eco-Efficiency  analysis  developed  by BASF. It can be used to evaluate and compare the environmental impact, costs and social aspects of products and manufacturing processes. SEEbalance \u00ae makes sustainable development measurable and manageable for companies by combining the three dimensions of sustainability - economy, environment and society in an integrated product assessment tool.\n\n## Steam cracker\n\nA steam cracker is a plant in which steam is used to 'crack' naphtha (petroleum) or natural gas. The resulting petrochemicals are the raw materials used to produce most of BASF's products.\n\nT\n\n## Traits\n\nTraits are commercial plant characteristics, such as an inherent resistance to certain herbicides or an inherent defense against certain  insects.\n\nV\n\n## Value Chain\n\nA  value  chain  describes  the  successive  steps  in  a  production process: from raw materials through various intermediate steps, such as transportation and production, to the finished product.\n\n## Verbund\n\nIn the BASF Verbund, plants are intelligently connected. In this system, chemical processes consume less energy, produce higher product yields and conserve resources. The by-products of one plant serve as feedstock elsewhere, creating efficient value chains/uni00A0from  basic  chemicals  to  high  value-added  solutions;  such  as coatings or crop protection products. Our Verbund concept/uni00A0 realized in production, technologies, the market and digitalization/uni00A0enables innovative solutions for a sustainable future.\n\n## Trademarks a\n\n## Ebusbar \u00ae\n\nRegistered trademark of Shenzhen Qianhai Ebusbar Network Service Co, Ltd.\n\n## Responsible Care \u00ae\n\nRegistered  trademark  of  the  European  Chemical  Industry Council.\n\nAll other trademarks referred to in the BASF Report are registered trademarks of the BASF Group (identified with the \u00ae symbol), trademarks pending (identified with the TM symbol), or trademarks used by the BASF Group.\n\n- a Trademarks are not registered/used in all countries.\n\n<!-- image -->",
