        "page_content": "## To Our Fellow Shareholders\n\nAs Regency embarks on its 60 year of operations th and 30 th year as a publicly traded REIT, we are immensely proud of the company we were and the company we have become. Our long-term track record of sector-leading performance is a testament to the quality of our portfolio, our relationships with our tenants, the strength of our balance sheet, and a special corporate culture that allows us to attract and retain a talented and committed team.\n\n2022 was another strong year for Regency. We continue to benefit from post-pandemic structural tailwinds, including migration patterns and permanent flexible work trends that support the strength of our suburban trade areas. We saw robust tenant demand throughout the year, culminating in record shop space leasing and tenant retention rates, mid-teens rent growth, including the impact of contractual rent steps, and the performance of our development and redevelopment projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe enter 2023 with great momentum and persistent strength in the operating environment, and our leasing and value-creation pipelines are robust. We do recognize the uncertainty associated with the macroeconomic backdrop. While our centers and tenants may be largely recession-resistant, we would not be immune to a material slowdown in the U.S. economy. At the same time, we take comfort in having built a company and amassed a portfolio that can withstand as well as outperform through cycles. Our current tenant base is as strong and resilient as ever, and our exposure to struggling retailers is limited. The demographic profile of our trade areas, as well as the nondiscretionary nature of our tenancy, insulates us from both inflationary and economic impacts on the consumer.\n\nEast San Marco - Jacksonville, FL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur cycle-tested approach also extends to our balance sheet and liquidity position. This is especially true of the generation of substantial free cash flow, which in 2022 allowed us to continue to grow our development and redevelopment pipelines, pursue accretive acquisition opportunities, and execute share repurchases during a time of dislocation in the capital markets. We ended 2022 with leverage of 5.0x Net Debt-to-EBITDA at the low end of our long-term target range and one of the lowest in our industry sector, no unsecured debt maturities until 2024, and a zero balance on our $1.25B credit facility.\n\nAs such, we entered 2023 well-positioned from a capital allocation perspective. With over $140 million of free cash flow expected, we have the capability to self-fund our current construction projects and to grow our development and redevelopment pipelines back to an annual spend north of $200 million over the next few years. We still consider development and redevelopment as the best use of our capital and the strongest pathways toward value creation. As always, we will look to raise incremental capital to fund investments if the opportunity creates value and drives accretion.\n\nLastly, Regency takes pride in being a respected leader in corporate responsibility, and our actions in 2022 furthered our efforts in that regard. After a year of building a strategy to do so, we established an absolute short-term (2030) scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi'), as well as set a long-term (2050) target to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions. Doing what is right for our employees, communities, and shareholders is core to our values at Regency.",

        "page_content": "## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Report\") combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to \"Regency Centers Corporation\" or the \"Parent Company\" mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries and references to \"Regency Centers, L.P.\" or the \"Operating Partnership\" mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries. The terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" \"the Company\", \"Regency Centers\" and \"Regency\" as used in this Report mean the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively.\n\nThe Parent Company is a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units (\"Units\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.6% of the Units in the Operating Partnership. The remaining limited Units are owned by third party investors. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- x Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- x Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and\n- x Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nManagement operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership. These individuals are officers of the Parent Company and employees of the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Company believes it is important to understand the key differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of Units of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. Except for $200 million of unsecured private placement debt, the Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is also the co-issuer and guarantees the $200 million of Parent Company debt. The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business. These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of partnership units.\n\nStockholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units. The limited partners' Units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of stockholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.\n\nIn order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this Report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.\n\nAs general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, while stockholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.",

These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"anticipate,\" \"guidance,\" and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors \" of this Report. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with and submissions to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as and to the extent required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1. Business\n\nRegency Centers Corporation is a fully integrated real estate company and self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust that began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. Regency Centers, L.P. is the entity through which Regency Centers Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets. Our business consists of acquiring, developing, owning, and operating income-producing retail real estate principally located in top markets within the United States. We generate revenues by leasing space to necessity, service, convenience, and value-based retailers serving the essential needs of our communities. Regency has been an S&P 500 Index member since 2017.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had full or partial ownership interests in 404 properties, primarily anchored by market leading grocery stores, encompassing 51.1 million square feet (\"SF\") of gross leasable area (\"GLA\"). Our Pro-rata share of this GLA is 43.3 million square feet, including our share of properties owned through unconsolidated investment partnerships.\n\nWe are a preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics. Our mission is to create thriving environments for retailers and service providers to connect with surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Our vision is to elevate quality of life as an integral thread in the fabric of our communities. Our portfolio includes thriving properties merchandised with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers that connect with their neighborhoods, communities, and customers.\n\n## Our values:\n\n- x We are our people: Our people are our greatest asset, and we believe a talented team from differing backgrounds and experiences makes us better.\n- x We do what is right: We act with unwavering standards of honesty and integrity.\n- x We connect with our communities: We promote philanthropic ideas and strive for the betterment of our neighborhoods by giving our time and financial support.\n- x We are responsible: Our duty is to balance purpose and profit, being good stewards of capital and the environment for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n- x We strive for excellence: When we are passionate about what we do, it is reflected in our performance.\n- x We are better together: When we listen to each other and our customers, we will succeed together.",

        "page_content": "## Our goals are to:\n\n- x Own and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers primarily anchored by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban trade areas in the most desirable metro areas in the United States of America (\"USA\" or \"United States\"). We believe that this strategy will result in highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers. These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow net operating income (\"NOI\");\n- x Maintain an industry leading and disciplined development and redevelopment platform to create exceptional retail centers that deliver favorable returns;\n- x Support our business activities with a conservative capital structure, including a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs together with a carefully constructed debt maturity profile;\n- x Implement leading environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") practices through our Corporate Responsibility Program;\n- x Engage and retain an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our strong values, while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement; and\n- x Create shareholder value by increasing earnings and dividends per share that generate total returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers.\n\nKey strategies to achieve our goals are to:\n\n- x Generate same property NOI growth that over the long-term consistently ranks at or near the top of our shopping center peers;\n- x Reinvest free cash flow and portfolio enhancement disposition proceeds into high-quality developments, redevelopments and acquisitions in a long term accretive manner;\n- x Maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides liquidity, financial flexibility and cost effective funding of investment opportunities, while also managing debt maturities that enable us to weather economic downturns;\n- x Pursue best-in-class ESG programs and practices; and\n- x Attract, retain, and engage an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our values while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the USA based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that own shopping centers and also anchor some of our shopping centers. This results in competition for attracting tenants as well as acquiring existing shopping centers and new development sites. In addition, brick and mortar shopping centers face continued competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods. We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:\n\n- x the market areas in which we operate, and the locations of our shopping centers within those market areas;\n- x the design of our shopping centers including our strategy of maintaining and renovating these centers to our high standards of quality;\n- x the compelling demographics surrounding our shopping centers;\n- x our relationships with our anchor, shop, and out-parcel tenants;\n- x our management experience and expertise; and\n- x our ability to successfully develop, redevelop, and acquire shopping centers.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Responsibility and Human Capital\n\nWhile executing our mission, we strive to achieve best-in-class corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility, including our focus on ESG practices, is a foundational strategy of Regency. We believe that alignment of strategy and sustainable outcomes is critical to the long-term success of our Company, our shareholders, and the environment. Our ESG practices are built on four pillars:\n\n- x Our People;\n- x Our Communities;\n- x Ethics and Governance; and\n- x Environmental Stewardship.\n\nThese practices are guided by three overarching concepts: long-term value creation, our Regency brand and reputation, and the importance of maintaining our culture. Our continued commitment to these concepts guides our business strategy and helps us identify and address key corporate responsibility-related matters.\n\nWe regularly review our corporate responsibility (which term we use interchangeably with \"ESG\") strategies, goals, and objectives with our Board of Directors and its committees, which oversee our programs. More information about our corporate responsibility strategy, goals, performance, and reporting, including our annual Corporate Responsibility report, our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") report, and our policies and practices related to corporate responsibility, is available on our website at www.regencycenters.com. The content of our website and other information contained therein, including relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\nOur People - Our people are our most important asset, and we strive to ensure that they are engaged, passionate about their work, connected to their teams, and supported to deliver their best performance. Regency recognizes and values the importance of attracting and retaining talented individuals with different skills, backgrounds, and experiences to encourage diversity of thoughts and ideas. In addition, we strive to maintain a safe and healthy workspace, promote employee well-being, and empower our employees by focusing on their personal and professional development through training and education opportunities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 445 employees, including 5 part-time employees. We presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.\n\nIn 2022, we continued implementing our comprehensive, multi-year diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") strategy focused on promoting and advancing diversity across our organization, enabling our employees to grow and succeed, and supporting social justice initiatives in our operations and broader communities. Furthermore, aligned with our near-and long-term human capital goals, we remained focused on employee engagement, leveraging our annual employee survey to identify opportunities to improve and further engage our people. Additionally, we continued to develop our employees and look for new opportunities to ensure we attract and retain our most important assets: our people.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion We believe that much of our success is rooted in the diversity and inclusion of our teams and our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture. We value diversity at all levels and focus on extending our DEI initiatives across our workforce. We continue to foster a culture in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute and thrive. Our commitment is unwavering, and we remain focused on building a workforce that represents the many customers we serve and the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur most recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 survey data can be found on our website, including additional information related to employee gender and ethnic diversity.\n\nHuman Rights - Regency is committed to a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and is focused on advancing fundamental human rights. Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training is provided to all employees at orientation, and annually thereafter.\n\nTalent Attraction and Retention - Our core values place a strong importance on our people, which we believe makes us an employer of choice. We understand the importance of attracting and retaining the best talent to build long-term value. We strive to offer some of the most competitive pay and benefits in the industry in which we operate and are continually looking for new opportunities to ensure that we attract and retain our people.",

        "page_content": "Training and Development - We strive to provide an environment where our people are connected to their teams, passionate about what they do, and supported to deliver their best efforts and results. From individual contributors to managers and senior leaders, we want to empower our employees to take control of their career growth and realize their full potential through meaningful training and development opportunities.\n\nHealth, Safety, and Well-Being - The safety, health, and well-being of our people are a top priority for Regency. We strive to provide a benefit package that is comprehensive, competitive, and thoughtfully designed to attract and retain the best in the business. We prioritize employee safety at our centers and offices, and require contractors working at our sites to engage in safe work practices.\n\nOur Communities - Our predominately grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provide many benefits to the communities in which we live and work, including significant local economic impacts in the form of investment, jobs, and taxes. Our local teams are passionate about investing in and engaging with our communities as they customize and cultivate our centers to create a distinctive environment to bring our tenants and shoppers together for the best retail experience.\n\nWe believe philanthropy and charitable giving are important elements of our corporate responsibility commitment. Throughout 2022, Regency supported its employees to serve and invest in community organizations through volunteer and financial support. Charitable contributions were made directly by the Company, as well as by the vast majority of our employees who donated their time and money to local non-profits directly serving their communities. Furthermore, as part of our strategy, we continued to improve our communities by investing in property enhancements and placemaking at our new and existing shopping centers.\n\nEthics and Governance - As long-term stewards of our investors' capital, we are committed to best-in-class corporate governance. To create long-term value for our stakeholders, we place great emphasis on our culture and core values, the integrity and transparency of our reporting practices, and our overall governance structure in respect of oversight and shareholder rights.\n\nTo achieve the right mix of skills, experience, backgrounds, tenures, and competencies, including diversity in terms of gender, ethnic background, age, and other attributes, Regency's board of directors annually reviews its overall board composition. In 2022, Regency announced the appointment of Kristin A. Campbell to our board of directors, effective January 15, 2023. Mrs. Campbell's appointment aligns with Regency's ongoing commitment to board refreshment and best-in-class corporate governance.\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship - We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our investors, tenants, employees, and the communities in which we operate, and we strive to integrate sustainable practices throughout our business.\n\nWe have seven strategic priorities for identifying and implementing sustainable business practices and minimizing our environmental impact: green building, energy efficiency, renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions (\"GHG\") reduction, water conservation, waste management, and climate change analysis. We believe these strategic priorities are not only the right thing to do to address environmental concerns such as air pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity but also support us in achieving key strategic objectives in our operations and development projects.\n\nDuring 2022, we remained committed to measuring and reducing our GHG emissions. Earlier in the year, we refined our strategy and elevated our commitment by aligning our goals with the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"). We have committed to reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, endorsed by the SBTi, and to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions across all operations by 2050. Concurrently, we announced new near-and long-term goals to demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability as described in our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report. Based on our current estimates and asset base, we do not expect these commitments to materially impact our operating results and financial condition.\n\nAs a long-term owner, operator, and developer of real estate, we acknowledge the potential for climate change to have a material impact on our properties, people, and long-term success. Regency wants to ensure that our properties can safely, sustainably, and responsibly withstand the test of time. We continue to refine our understanding of our exposure to climate-related impacts by conducting ongoing property-level analysis. We continue our efforts to understand and address the risks that climate change may pose to our business.\n\n## Compliance with Governmental Regulations\n\nWe are subject to various regulatory and tax-related requirements within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to such requirements may result in unanticipated material financial impacts or adverse tax consequences and could materially affect our operating results and financial condition. Significant regulatory requirements include the laws and regulations described below.",

        "page_content": "## REIT Laws and Regulations\n\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), REITs are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year. We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income. We will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\n\nWe have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\"). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes which, to date, have not been material to us.\n\n## Environmental Laws and Regulations\n\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to assess and remediate certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers. To the extent any environmental issues arise, they most typically stem from the historic practices of current and former dry cleaners, gas stations, and other similar businesses at our centers, as well as the presence of asbestos in some structures. These requirements often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or committed the acts or omissions that caused the presence of the hazardous substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly address contamination caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of assessment and remediation, known environmental liabilities are not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial condition.\n\n## Information About Our Executive Officers\n\nOur executive officers are appointed each year by our Board of Directors. Each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years and, as of December 31, 2022, included the following:\n\n| Name                 |   Age | Title                                             | Executive Officer in Position Shown Since   |\n|----------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Martin E.

(\"Broadridge\"), Lake Success, NY. We offer a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that enables our shareholders to reinvest dividends automatically, as well as to make voluntary cash payments toward the purchase of additional shares. For more information, contact Broadridge toll free at (877) 830-4936 or our Shareholder Relations Department at (904) 598-7000.\n\nThe Company's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and trades under the stock symbol \"REG\".\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is KPMG LLP, Jacksonville, Florida, Firm ID 185.\n\n## Annual Meeting of Shareholders\n\nOur 2023 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, and will be conducted in a virtual-only format to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") presentations, we use and report certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\n\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of the Company.\n\n## Defined Terms\n\nThe following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results, and are included in this document:\n\n- x Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure we use because the computation of Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance. Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market debt adjustments, and (iv) other amounts as they occur. We provide reconciliations of both Net income attributable to common stockholders to Nareit FFO and Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.\n- x Development Completion is a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations. Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property.\n- x Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as Operating EBITDA re divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders.",

        "page_content": "- x Nareit EBITDAre is a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains on sales of real estate, (v) impairments of real estate, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n- x Nareit Funds from Operations (\"Nareit FFO\") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition.\n- Companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. We provide a reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to Nareit FFO.\n- x Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income. NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees. We also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.\n- x Non-Same Property is any property, during either calendar year period being compared, that was acquired, sold, a Property in Development, a Development Completion, or a property under, or being positioned for, significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods. Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property.\n- x Operating EBITDAre begins with the Nareit EBITDA re and excludes certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization and straight-line rents. We provide a reconciliation of Net Income to Nareit EBITDA re to Operating EBITDA re.\n- x Pro-rata information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.\n\nWe provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP. We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and other metrics, along with certain other non-GAAP measures, makes comparison of our operating results to those of other REITs more meaningful. The Prorata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP. The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the properties in our portfolio\n\nThe Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio. We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital. Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share.",

        "page_content": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our other filings and submissions to the SEC, which provide much more information and detail. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition and/ or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to the Current Economic Environment\n\n## Continued rising interest rates in the current economic environment may adversely impact our cost to borrow, real estate valuation, and stock price.\n\nOn multiple occasions during 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\"the U.S. Federal Reserve\") raised its benchmark federal funds rate, which has led to numerous increases in interest rates in the credit markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve may continue to raise the federal funds rate, which will likely lead to higher interest rates in the credit markets. Additionally, U.S. government policies implemented to address inflation, including actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, may negatively impact consumer spending, our tenants' businesses, and/or future demand for space in our shopping centers.\n\nRising interest rates adversely impact our cost of borrowing. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term includes our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and variable rate based secured notes payable. Increases in interest rates could increase our financing costs over time, either through near-term borrowings on our floatingrate line of credit or refinancing of our existing borrowings that may incur higher interest expenses related to the issuance of new debt. Prolonged periods of higher interest rates may negatively impact the valuation of our real estate asset portfolio and could result in the decline of our stock price and market capitalization, which may adversely impact our ability and willingness to raise equity capital on favorable terms through sales of our common shares, including through our At the Market (\"ATM\") program.\n\nAlthough the extent of any prolonged periods of higher interest rates remains unknown at this time, negative impacts to our cost of capital may also adversely affect our future business plans and growth, at least in the near term.\n\n## Current economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impact our tenants and our business.\n\nThe success of our tenants in operating their businesses and their corresponding ability to pay us rent continue to be significantly impacted by many current economic challenges, which impact their cost of doing business, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain constraints, decreasing consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and increasing energy prices and interest rates. Additionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks create challenges that may exacerbate current market conditions in the United States, including the potential for a recession.\n\nThese economic challenges could adversely impact our volume of leasing activity, which could include tenant move outs and/or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as negatively affect the business and financial results of our tenants. The aggregate impacts of these current economic challenges may also negatively affect the overall market for retail space, resulting in decreased demand for space in our centers. This, in turn, could result in pricing pressure on rent that we are able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rent spreads could be adversely impacted. Further, we may experience higher costs for tenant buildouts, as costs of materials and labor may increase and supply and availability of both may become more limited.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health Crises\n\nPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants' financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments mandated or recommended various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of COVID-19, which altered customer behaviors and temporarily limited many of our tenants' ability to operate. As a result, certain tenants requested rent concessions or sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment. Some tenants chose not to reopen or to honor the terms of their lease agreements. In addition, moratoria and other legal restrictions in certain states impacted our ability to bring legal action to enforce our leases and our ability to collect rent. Should federal, state, and local governments mandate or recommend lockdowns again in the future due to a pandemic or other similar health crises, tenants could request rent concessions or seek to renegotiate future rents.",

        "page_content": "In the event of future pandemics or similar health crises, consumers could elect to make more of their purchases online instead of in physical stores and businesses could delay executing new or renewals of leases amidst the immediate and uncertain economic impacts. These developments, coupled with potential tenant failures and a reduction in newly-formed businesses, could result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers, which could result in lower occupancy or higher levels of uncollectible lease income, as well as downward pressure on rents. Additionally, delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of constraints on supply chains and labor, resulting from government ordered lockdowns, could result in delayed rent commencement due to it taking longer for new tenants to open and operate.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations could be negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of a new virus strain of COVID-19 or any future pandemic or other health crisis. Our tenants' ability to respond to these disruptions and uncertainties, including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers' shopping habits and behaviors, may impact their ability to survive, and ultimately, their ability to comply with their lease obligations. Our future results of operations and overall financial performance could be uncertain should a new virus strain of COVID-19, or future pandemics or other health crises occur.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping Centers\n\nEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.\n\nOur properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent, expense recoveries and other income. Therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, and/or tenants demand modified lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions. The economic and market conditions potentially affecting the retail industry and our properties specifically include the following:\n\n- x changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;\n- x changes in population and migration patterns to/from the markets in which we operate;\n- x deterioration in the competitiveness and creditworthiness of our retail tenants;\n- x increased competition from the use of e-commerce by retailers and consumers as well as other concepts that could impact more traditional retail;\n- x labor challenges and supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including continuing disruptions to global supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures;\n- x tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejections of our leases;\n- x reductions in consumer spending and retail sales, including inflationary impacts on consumer behavior;\n- x reduced tenant demand for retail space;\n- x oversupply of retail space;\n- x reduced consumer demand for certain retail categories;\n- x consolidation within the retail sector;\n- x increased operating costs attendant to owning and operating retail shopping centers;\n- x perceptions by retailers and shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties; and\n- x other factors which could alter shopping habits or otherwise deter customers from visiting our shopping centers, such as criminal activity, including civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or other types of violent crimes.\n\nTo the extent that any or a combination of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the emergence of new tenants, the demand for retail space, market rents and rent growth, capital expenditures, the percent leased levels of our properties, the value of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.",

        "page_content": "## Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nRetailers are increasingly impacted by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, including shopping from home and the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online. Retailers are considering these customer buying habits and other trends when making decisions regarding their brick and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment. Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing change in customer buying habits, including increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of their retail locations in the future or close stores. For example, our grocer tenants are incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot traffic at our centers. These alternative delivery methods are more likely to impact foot traffic at our centers in certain higher-income markets where consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services. Changes in customer buying habits and shopping trends may also impact the profitability and financial condition of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions, and therefore may impact their ability to pay rent. This shift may adversely impact our percent leased and rental rates, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.\n\nEconomic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance. Our properties in California and Florida represent 26.0% and 21.3%, respectively, of our annualized base rent. Our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas. Additionally, there is a risk that businesses and residents in major metropolitan cities may relocate to different states or suburban markets.\n\n## Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our \"anchor\" tenants.\n\n\"Anchor Tenants\" (tenants occupying 10,000 square feet or more) operate large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the attraction and success of other tenants by drawing shoppers to the property. Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and incurrence of additional costs in the event a significant Anchor Tenant:\n\n- x becomes bankrupt or insolvent;\n- x experiences a downturn in its business;\n- x shifts its capital allocation away from brick and mortar formats;\n- x materially defaults on its leases;\n- x does not renew its leases as they expire;\n- x renews at lower rental rates and/or requires a tenant improvement allowance; or\n- x renews but reduces its store size, which results in down-time and additional tenant improvement costs to the landlord to release the vacated space.\n\nSome anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement. Vacated \"Anchor Space\" (spaces 10,000 square feet or more), including space that may be owned by the anchor (as discussed below), can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power. In addition, if a significant tenant vacates a property, so-called \"co-tenancy clauses\" in select leases may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent payment or other lease obligations. Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.\n\nAdditionally, some of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space in a location that is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center (\"shadow anchors\"). In those cases, the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and, as a result, attract additional consumer traffic to the center. In the event that a shadow Anchor Space becomes vacant, it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced.",

        "page_content": "## A percentage of our revenues are derived from \"local\" tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if these tenants are not successful, or if the demand for the types or mix of tenants significantly change.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, tenants with less than three locations (\"Local Tenants\") represent approximately 22% of annualized base rent. Local Tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers. These Local Tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions and changing customer buying habits and retail trends as they may have more limited resources and access to capital than other tenants. As such, in the event of such changing conditions, habits and trends, they may suffer disproportionately greater impacts and be at greater risk of lease default than other tenants.\n\n## We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.\n\nAlthough lease income is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.\n\n## Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases.\n\nCertain costs and expenses associated with our operating our properties, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area expenses, generally do not decrease in the event of reduced occupancy or rental rates, non-payment of rents by tenants, general economic downturns, pandemics or other similar circumstances. In fact, in some cases, such as real estate taxes and insurance, they may actually increase despite such events. As such, we may not be able to lower the operating expenses of our properties sufficiently to fully offset such circumstances and may not be able to fully recoup these costs from our tenants. In such cases, our cash flows, operating results and financial performance may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other building, fire, and safety regulations may have a material negative effect on us.\n\nAll of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with ADA requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected. In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations and building codes as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties. Costs to be in compliance with the ADA or any other building, fire, and safety regulations could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments\n\n## Our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.\n\nOur real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable which may result in impairment. We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including declines in property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities, including goodwill) may not be recoverable and therefore may be impaired. Our evaluation includes several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results. Changes in our investment, redevelopment, and disposition strategies or changes in the market where an asset is located may alter management's intended holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to our financial condition or operating performance.",

        "page_content": "The fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach. Such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.\n\nThese subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material. There can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.\n\n## We face risks associated with development, redevelopment, and expansion of properties.\n\nWe actively pursue opportunities for new retail development and existing property redevelopment and/or expansion. Development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements, and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay development and redevelopment projects. We may not recover our investment in our projects for which approvals are not received, and delays may adversely impact our expected returns. Additionally, changes in political elections and policies may impact our ability to obtain favorable land use and zoning for in-process and future developments and redevelopment projects. We are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following:\n\n- x we may be unable to lease developments or redevelopments to full occupancy on a timely basis;\n- x the occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable, or not profitable enough to meet our investment return expectations;\n- x actual costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project unprofitable, or not profitable enough to meet our investment return expectations;\n- x delays in the development or construction process may increase our costs;\n- x construction cost increases may reduce investment returns on development and redevelopment opportunities;\n- x we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities and lose our investment due to adverse market conditions;\n- x the size of our development and redevelopment pipeline may strain our labor or capital capacity to complete the development and redevelopment projects within targeted timelines and may reduce our investment returns;\n- x a reduction in the demand for new retail space may reduce our future development and redevelopment activities, which in turn may reduce our NOI; and\n- x changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity may adversely impact our results of operations by reducing the amount of internal overhead costs that may be capitalized.\n\n## We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.\n\nIf we engage in more complex acquisitions and mixed-use development and redevelopment projects, there could be more unique risks to our return on investment. Mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes. We have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do retail real estate. As a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer.\n\n- x If we decide to develop the non-retail components ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate, but also to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, including but not limited to more complex entitlement processes and multiple-story buildings. These unique risks may adversely impact our return on investment in these mixed-use development projects.\n- x If we sell the non-retail components, our retail component will be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners, and actions of those occupying the non-retail spaces in these mixed-use properties.\n- x If we partner with a developer, it makes us dependent upon the partner's ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact our investment returns of the project. In addition, there is a risk that the non-retail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other components ourselves, including providing necessary financing.",

The acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:\n\n- x properties we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we estimate, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the investment returns we project;\n- x our investigation of an entity, property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representation we may have received from such seller, may fail to reveal various liabilities including defects, necessary repairs or environmental matters requiring corrective action, which may increase our costs;\n- x our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short, either of which may result in the property failing to achieve our projected return, either temporarily or permanently;\n- x we may not recover our costs from an unsuccessful acquisition;\n- x our acquisition activities may distract or strain our management capacity; and\n- x we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition into our existing operations platform.\n\n## We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions.\n\nOur properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash. Macro-economic events, pandemics and other health crises may impact our ability to sell properties on our preferred timing and at prices and returns we deem acceptable. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties, including properties held in joint ventures, in response to changes in economic, industry, financial market, or other conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. There may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing. If we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment.\n\n## Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.\n\nCertain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a meaningful taxable gain on sale. We utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 like-kind exchanges to tax-efficiently buy and sell properties; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions or that changes to the tax laws do not eliminate the benefits of effectuating 1031 exchanges, or significantly change the requirements for a transaction to qualify for 1031 exchange treatment. In the event that we cannot or do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments or other priorities.",

To the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets, especially those nearer to the coasts, may experience increases in storm frequency and intensity and rising sea-levels. Further, population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our centers. For example, climate and other environmental changes may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties, reduced rent or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance or making insurance unavailable. Moreover, while the federal government has not yet enacted comprehensive legislation to address climate change, certain states in which we own and operate shopping centers, including California and New York, have done so. Compliance with these and future new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make additional investments in or for our existing properties, resulting in increased capital expenditures and operating costs, implement new or additional processes and controls to facilitate compliance, and/or pay additional energy, insurance, taxes and related fees and costs. At this time, there can be no assurance that we can anticipate all potential material impacts of climate change, or that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance in the future.\n\n## Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change.\n\nA significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise, and other natural disasters. At December 31, 2022, 20.6% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the state of California, including a number of properties in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas. Additionally, 22.4% and 7.8% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the states of Florida and Texas, respectively. Insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased, and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future. We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase. These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas. Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks.\n\n## Costs of environmental remediation may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.\n\nUnder various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs to assess and remediate the presence of hazardous substances on the property, which in our case most typically arise from current or former dry cleaners, gas stations, asbestos usage, and historic land use practices. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances, which may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow. The presence of, or the failure to properly address the presence of, hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. We can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities or their ultimate cost to address; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their interpretation, will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.",

As they evaluate investment decisions, many investors look not only at company disclosures but also to ESG rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow ESG comparisons between companies. Although we participate in a number of these ratings systems, we do not participate in all such systems, and may not score as well in all of the available ratings systems as other REITs and real estate operators. Further, the criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict with each other and change frequently, and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well in the future. We supplement our participation in ratings systems with published disclosures of our ESG activities, but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide. In addition, as noted above, the SEC is currently evaluating potential new regulations that could impose additional ESG disclosure and other compliance requirements on us. Failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could adversely impact us when investors compare us against similar companies in our industry, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock, which could adversely impact our stock price and our ability to raise capital.\n\n## An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.\n\nWe carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, terrorism, business interruption, and environmental insurance for our properties. Some types of losses, such as losses from named windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have more limited coverage, or in some cases, can be excluded from insurance coverage. In addition, it is possible that the availability of insurance coverage in certain areas may decrease in the future, and the cost to procure such insurance may increase due to factors beyond our control. We may reduce the insurance we procure as a result of the foregoing or other factors. Should a loss occur at any of our properties that is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\n\nTerrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss. Insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of violence, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.\n\n## Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and other key personnel, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented and diverse employees may significantly impact our future performance. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key personnel or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. Losing any key personnel may have an adverse effect on us.",

Many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business. We are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party's information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of tenants' or employees' data or our confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants, employees, and revenues, incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans. Additionally, a successful ransomware attack, denial of service, or other impactful type of cyber-attack may occur. Despite planning, preparation, and preventative measures, such attacks may be successful and our business may be significantly disrupted if unable to quickly recover. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability, and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers. Despite the ongoing significant investments in technology and training we make in cybersecurity, we can provide no assurance that we will avoid or prevent such breaches or attacks.\n\nAdditionally, federal, state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection. Monitoring such changes, and taking steps to comply, involves significant costs and effort by management, which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\n\nDespite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our systems are vulnerable to damage from multiple sources other than cybersecurity risks, including computer viruses, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failure. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures\n\nWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.\n\nWe have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties. These activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties. However, these investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.\n\nThese investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in a premature termination of the applicable partnership or joint venture, or potentially litigation or arbitration, that may increase our investment and related risk as well as our costs and expenses associated with the investment, and distract management from sufficiently focusing their time and efforts on others areas of our business. In addition, we risk the possibility of being held liable for the actions of our partners or other owners. These factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.\n\n## The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\n\nIf partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we could lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders. Certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buy/sell clauses. The election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners' interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure\n\n## Our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings.\n\nAs part of our funding strategy, we sell properties that no longer meet our strategic objectives or investment standards and/or those with a limited future growth profile. These sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisition of other properties, and new developments and redevelopments. An increase in market capitalization rates (which may or may not be driven by an increase in interest rates) or a decline in NOI may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated. Additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.\n\n## We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains). Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations. In such instances, we would rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. In addition to finding lenders willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.\n\nIn addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing. Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.\n\nWithout access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales. Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate. If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.\n\n## Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders. If we cannot make required mortgage loan payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.\n\n## Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.\n\nOur unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit (the \"Line\") contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio. These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities. Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default. Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes and the Line, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.\n\n## Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nAlthough a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility, term loan, and certain secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, less than 1.0% of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed rate debt. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates. This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.",

There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations. Should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement. In addition, failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our Securities\n\n## Changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\n\nThe market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:\n\n- x actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n- x changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;\n- x publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry in general and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;\n- x the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to re-lease space as leases expire;\n- x increases in market interest rates that drive investors in, or potential purchasers of, our stock to seek other investments or demand a higher dividend yield;\n- x changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n- x adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;\n- x any future issuances of equity securities;\n- x additions or departures of key management personnel;\n- x strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n- x actions by institutional stockholders;\n- x reports by corporate governance rating companies;\n- x increased investor focus on sustainability-related risks, including climate change;\n- x changes in our dividend payments;\n- x potential tax law changes relating to REITs;\n- x speculation in the press or investment community; and\n- x general market and economic conditions.\n\nThese factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future. A decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity capital in the public markets. Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.",

        "page_content": "## There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates.\n\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:\n\n- x our financial condition and results of future operations;\n- x the terms of our loan covenants; and\n- x our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.\n\nIf we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to the Company's Qualification as a REIT\n\n## If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.\n\nWe believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that the Parent Company can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements. The Parent Company is also required to distribute to the stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. The Parent Company will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on undistributed taxable income and net capital gains and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions the Parent Company pays with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.\n\nAlso, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify. If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), the Parent Company would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our REIT status. Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot be assured that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.\n\nEven if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on its income and property. For example, if we have net income from \"prohibited transactions,\" that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale. While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.\n\nNew legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.",

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\"), however, domestic shareholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 3, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonREIT corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of the Parent Company's capital stock.\n\n## Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a \"domestically controlled\" REIT.\n\nA foreign person, other than a \"qualified shareholder\" or a \"qualified foreign pension fund,\" as each is defined for purposes of the Code, disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition. This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is \"domestically controlled.\" In general, the Parent Company will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder's disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons. If the Parent Company were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.\n\nWe seek to act in the best interests of the Parent Company as a whole and do not take into consideration the particular tax consequences to any specific holder of our stock. Foreign persons should inform themselves as to the U.S. tax consequences, and the tax consequences within the countries of their citizenship, residence, domicile, and place of business, with respect to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of shares of our common stock.\n\n## Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us or our investors.\n\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect the Parent Company or our investors. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect the Parent Company or our investors. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. There is also a risk that REIT status may be adversely impacted by a change in tax or other laws. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\n\n## Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\n\nThe REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Generally, income from a hedging transaction does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.\n\n## Risk Factors Related to the Company's Common Stock\n\n## Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company's capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.\n\nOwnership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT. This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.",

The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.\n\n## Ownership in the Parent Company may be diluted in the future.\n\nIn the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. In the past we have issued equity in the secondary market and may do so again in the future, depending on the price of our stock and other factors.\n\nIn addition, our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, limitations, and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\n\n## Item 1B.

Leases greater than 10,000 square feet (\"Anchor Leases\") generally have initial lease terms in excess of five years and are mostly comprised of Anchor Tenants. Many of the leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration. Our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed base rent, the tenant's Pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (\"CAM\") expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.",

These expiring leases have an average base rent of $25.88 PSF. The average base rent of new leases signed during 2022 was $32.47 PSF. During periods of economic weakness or when percent leased is low, tenants have more bargaining power, which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases. In periods of recovery and/or when percent leased levels are high, landlords have more bargaining power, which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases.\n\nDemand for retail space in high quality, community centers located in areas with compelling demographics remains strong, especially among successful business operators and growing innovative business concepts. However, inflationary challenges and the potential for an economic recession could result in pressure on base rent growth for new and renewal leases as businesses seek to manage costs.",

We are not currently involved in any litigation, nor, to our knowledge, is any litigation threatened against us, the outcome of which would, in our judgment based on information currently available to us, have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any threatened or pending legal proceedings.\n\n## Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## PART II\n\n## Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"REG.\"\n\nAs of February 06, 2023, there were 87,993 holders of our common stock.\n\nWe intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to Regency Centers Corporation's common stockholders. Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon cash generated by our operating results, our financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, future business prospects, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. In order to maintain Regency Centers Corporation's qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are generally required to make annual distributions equal to at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year. Under certain circumstances we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements. We have a dividend reinvestment plan under which our shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividends automatically in common stock. Under the plan, we may elect to purchase common stock in the open market on behalf of shareholders or may issue new common stock to such stockholders.\n\nUnder the revolving credit agreement of our Line, in the event of any monetary default, we may not make distributions to stockholders except to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status.\n\nThere were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe following table represents information with respect to purchases by Regency of its common stock by months during the three month period ended December 31, 2022:\n\n| Period                                      | Total number of shares purchased (1)   | Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs (2)   | Average price paid per share   | Maximum number or approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs (2)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| October 1, 2022, through October 31, 2022   | 169                                    | - $                                                                                    | 54.36 $                        | 174,607,162                                                                                                      |\n| November 1, 2022, through November 30, 2022 | -                                      | - $                                                                                    | - $                            | 174,607,162                                                                                                      |\n| December 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022 | -                                      | - $                                                                                    | - $                            | 174,607,162                                                                                                      |",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Executing on our Strategy\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we had Net income attributable to common stockholders of $482.9 million, which includes gains on sale of real estate of $109.0 million, as compared to $361.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n- x Our Pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew 2.9%, primarily attributable to continued improvement in collections of lease income from cash basis tenants, combined with improvements in base rent from increases in year over year occupancy rates, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and positive rent spreads on new and renewal leases.\n- x We executed 1,981 new and renewal leasing transactions representing 7.3 million Pro-rata SF with positive trailing 12 month rent spreads of 7.4% during 2022, compared to 1,979 leasing transactions representing 7.0 million Pro-rata SF with positive trailing 12 month rent spreads of 5.5% in 2021. Rent spreads are calculated on all executed leasing transactions for comparable Retail Operating Property spaces, including spaces vacant greater than 12 months.\n- x At December 31, 2022, our total property portfolio was 94.8% leased while our same property portfolio was 95.1% leased, compared to 94.1% and 94.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers:\n\n- x Estimated Pro-rata project costs of our current in process development and redevelopment projects totaled $300.9 million compared to $307.3 million at December 31, 2021.\n- x Development and redevelopment projects completed during 2022 represented $122.0 million of estimated net project costs, with an average stabilized yield of 7%.\n\nWe maintained liquidity and financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:\n\n- x During April 2022, we settled and issued 984,618 common shares under forward sale agreements at a weighted-average price of $65.78, before any underwriting discount and offering expenses. Net proceeds received at settlement were approximately $61.3 million and were used to fund acquisitions.\n- x During June 2022, we executed multiple trades to purchase 1,294,201 common shares under the Authorized Repurchase Program for a total of $75.4 million at a weighted average price of $58.25 per share. All repurchased shares were retired on the respective settlement dates.\n- x We have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and just over $110 million of secured mortgage maturities in 2023, including mortgages within our real estate partnerships.\n- x At December 31, 2022, our Pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDA re ratio on a trailing 12 month basis was 5.0x compared to 5.1x at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Leasing Activity and Significant Tenants\n\nWe believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics create attractive spaces for retail and service providers to operate their businesses.\n\n## Pro-rata Percent Leased\n\nThe following table summarizes Pro-rata percent leased of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\n\n|                                   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Percent Leased - All properties   | 94.8%               | 94.1%               |\n| Anchor Space (spaces \u0448 10,000 SF) | 96.8%               | 97.0%               |\n| Shop Space (spaces < 10,000 SF)   | 91.5%               | 89.2%               |\n\nOur percent leased increased primarily due to favorable leasing activity in our Shop Space category during 2022.",

Space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $34.76 PSF. New and renewal rent spreads, as compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased, were positive at 7.4% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 5.5% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe success of our tenants in operating their businesses and their corresponding ability to pay us rent continue to be significantly impacted by many current economic challenges, which increase their cost of doing business, including, but not limited to, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain constraints, increasing energy prices and interest rates. Additionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks create challenges that may exacerbate current market conditions in the United States.\n\nThese economic conditions could adversely impact our volume of leasing activity, leasing spreads, and financial results generally, as well as adversely affect the business and financial results of our tenants. The aggregate impacts of these current economic challenges may also negatively affect the overall market for retail space, resulting in decreased demand for space in our centers. This, in turn, could result in downward pressure on rents that we are able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future spreads could be adversely impacted. Further, we may experience higher costs for tenant buildouts, as costs of materials and labor may increase and supply and availability of both may become more limited.",

We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through maintaining a high quality portfolio, tenant diversification, replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic, and maintaining our presence in suburban trade areas with compelling demographic populations benefiting from high levels of disposal income. The potential for a recession and the severity and duration of any economic downturn could negatively impact our existing tenants and their ability to continue to meet their lease obligations.\n\nAlthough base rent is derived from long-term lease contracts, tenants that file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and significant downtime to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. Tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.5% of our annual base rent on a Pro-rata basis.\n\n## Results from Operations\n\nThe United States is currently experiencing high levels of inflation. Inflation, as well as other ongoing changes in economic conditions such as labor shortages, employee retention costs, increased material and shipping costs, higher interest rates, and supply chain constraints have spurred a rise in wages and increased operating costs and challenges for our tenants and us.\n\nSubstantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operations by requiring tenants to pay their Pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities at our centers. Over half of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, primarily for Shop Space, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, our success in passing through increases in our operating expenses to our tenants is dependent on the tenants' ability to absorb and pay these increases. Additionally, increases in operating expenses passed through to our tenants, without a corresponding increase in our tenants' profitability, may limit our ability to grow base rent as tenants look to manage their total occupancy costs.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2022.\n\n## Supplemental Earnings Information\n\nWe use certain non-GAAP measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP. We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing our operating results to other REITs. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported non-GAAP measures could change. See \"Defined Terms\" in \"Item 1. Business \" for additional information regarding the definition of and other information regarding the non-GAAP measures we present in this Report.\n\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided, including as set forth below. Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating our financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.",

A significant portion of our cash from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a REIT.\n\nExcept for $200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership. All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships. The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company. The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity, and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.\n\nWe continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash requirements, including monitoring our tenant rent collections. We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations and our long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our in process and planned developments, redevelopments, and other capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt. We expect to meet these needs by using a combination of the following: cash flow from operations after funding our dividend, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, distributions received from our co-investment partnerships, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new unsecured debt. We continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of our debt currently outstanding.\n\nWe have no unsecured debt maturities in 2023, $250 million of unsecured debt maturing in 2024, and what we believe is a manageable level of secured mortgage maturities during the next 12 months, including those mortgages within our real estate partnerships. Based upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year.\n\nIn addition to our $66.5 million of unrestricted cash, we have the following additional sources of capital available:\n\n| (in thousands)                                                           | December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| ATMequity program (see note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) |                     |\n| Original offering amount                                                 | $ 500,000           |\n| Available capacity                                                       | $ 350,363           |\n| Line of Credit (see note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)     |                     |\n| Total commitment amount                                                  | $ 1,250,000         |\n| Available capacity (1)                                                   | $ 1,240,619         |\n| Maturity (2)                                                             | March 23, 2025      |\n\nThe declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors. On February 8, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend of $0.65 per share, payable on April 5, 2023, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2023. While future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated cash flow from operations of $655.8 million and $659.4 million, respectively, and paid $430.1 million and $404.9 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders, respectively.\n\nWe currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment. After funding our common stock dividend payment in January 2023, we estimate that we will require capital during the next 12 months of approximately $351.4 million related to leasing commissions, tenant improvements, in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships, and repaying maturing debt. These capital requirements are being impacted by current levels of high inflation resulting in increased costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third party contractors and suppliers. In response, we have implemented mitigation strategies such as entering into fixed cost construction contracts, pre-ordering materials, and other planning efforts. Further, continued challenges from permitting delays, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions may extend the time to completion of these projects.",

If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease.\n\nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2022, 89.5% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Our low level of encumbered assets allows us to more readily access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the Line. Our trailing 12 month fixed charge coverage ratio, including our Pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 4.6x and 4.5x for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and our Pro-rata net debt-tooperating EBITDA re ratio on a trailing 12 month basis was 5.0x and 5.1x, respectively, for the same periods.\n\nOur Line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2022, and expect to remain in compliance.

Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project.\n\nThe following table summarizes our development projects in-process and completed:\n\n| (in thousands, except cost PSF)   |                  |           |            |                                  | December 31, 2022                                | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022       | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Property Name                     | Market           | Ownership | Start Date | Estimated Stabilization Year (1) | Estimated / Actual Net Development Costs (2) (3) | GLA (3)             | Cost PSF of GLA (2) (3) | %of Costs Incurred  |\n| Developments In-Process           |                  |           |            |                                  |                                                  |                     |                         |                     |\n| Glenwood Green                    | Old Bridge, NJ   | 70%       | Q1-22      | 2025                             | $ 45,530                                         | 248                 | $ 184                   | 45%                 |\n| Eastfield at Baybrook -

We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business. These lease obligations are discussed in note 7;\n- x Our share of mortgage loans within our Investments in real estate partnerships, as discussed in note 4;\n- x Letters of credit of $9.4 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, the latter of which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects;\n- x Obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14; and\n- x We will also incur obligations related to construction or development contracts on projects in process; however, future amounts under these construction contracts are not due until future satisfactory performance under the contracts.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nKnowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. While the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting estimates, the estimates discussed below are believed to be critical because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Real Estate Investments\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances, including property operating performance, general market conditions or changes in expected hold periods, that indicate that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. If such events or changes occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.\n\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cash flow method uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow method above, as well as a discount rate. Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of fair value. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information. Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the expected hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers, pertaining primarily to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning and gas station tenants and the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers. We believe that the few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems, in accordance with the terms of our leases. We carry an environmental insurance policy for certain third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. We have also secured environmental insurance policies, where appropriate, on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accrued liabilities of $12.1 million for our Pro-rata share of environmental remediation, including our Investments in real estate partnerships. We believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. We can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination; that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:\n\n- x We have a Line commitment, as further described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which has a variable interest rate that as of December 31, 2022, was based upon an annual rate of LIBOR plus 0.865%. On January 12, 2023, the Line was amended to convert the reference rate from LIBOR to the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\") plus a 10 basis point market adjustment, with no changes in the applicable margin, which is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings. The current applicable margin is 0.865%. If our credit ratings are downgraded, the margin on the Line would increase, resulting in higher interest costs. The interest rate plus applicable margin based on our credit rating ranges from SOFR plus 0.690% to SOFR plus 1.540%.\n- x We are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt. The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.\n\nWe continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or fund our commitments. We continue to believe, in light of our credit ratings, the available capacity under our unsecured credit facility, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations. It is uncertain the degree to which capital market volatility and rising interest rates will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue.\n\nOur interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2022. For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate. The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of December 31, 2022, and are subject to change on a monthly basis. In addition, the Company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $42,500 per year based on $4.3 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. If the Company increases its line of credit balance in the future, additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Evaluation of expected hold periods for certain real estate assets\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and presented on the consolidated balance sheet, real estate assets, less accumulated depreciation was $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company evaluates real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable.\n\nWe identified the Company's assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate a shortened expected hold period for certain real estate properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the events or changes in circumstances assessed by the Company that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. A shortening of the expected hold period could indicate a potential impairment.",

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ KPMG LLP\n\nJacksonville, Florida February 17, 2023",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- (a) Organization and Principles of Consolidation\n\n## General\n\nRegency Centers Corporation (the \"Parent Company\") began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\"). The Parent Company primarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, and has no other assets other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership, and its only liabilities are $200 million of unsecured private placement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the \"Company\" or \"Regency\") owned 308 properties and held partial interests in an additional 96 properties through unconsolidated Investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as \"joint ventures\" or \"investment partnerships\").\n\n## Estimates, Risks, and Uncertainties\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the net carrying values of its real estate investments, collectibility of lease income, and acquired lease intangible assets and liabilities. It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest. Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company consolidates properties that are wholly-owned and properties where it owns less than 100%, but has control over the activities most important to the overall success of the partnership. Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") and voting interest entities. For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\n## Ownership of the Parent Company\n\nThe Parent Company has a single class of common stock outstanding.\n\n## Ownership of the Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units. As of December 31, 2022, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.6%, or 171,124,593, of the 171,866,026 outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining limited common Partnership Units held by third parties (\"Exchangeable operating partnership units\" or \"EOP units\"). Each EOP unit is exchangeable for cash or one share of common stock of the Parent Company, at the discretion of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or other assets (i.e. registered shares of the Parent). The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, as it relates to exchangeable operating",

Accordingly, the Parent Company classifies EOP units as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income. The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership. The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership. As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary. The Parent Company's only investment is the Operating Partnership. Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.\n\n## Real Estate Partnerships\n\nRegency has a partial ownership interest in 107 properties through partnerships, of which 11 are consolidated. Regency's partners include institutional investors and other real estate developers and/or operators (the \"Partners\" or \"Limited Partners\"). The assets of these partnerships are restricted to the use of the partnerships and cannot be used by general creditors of the Company. And similarly, the obligations of these partnerships can only be settled by the assets of these partnerships or additional contributions by the partners. Regency has a variable interest in these partnerships through its equity interests. As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing and property and asset management services to the partnerships. The Partners' level of involvement in these partnerships varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to participating involvement such as approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.\n\n- x Those partnerships for which the Partners are involved in the day to day decisions and do not have any other aspects that would cause them to be considered VIEs, are evaluated for consolidation using the voting interest model.\n- o Those partnerships in which Regency does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method and Regency's ownership interest is recognized through single-line presentation as Investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash distributions of earnings from operations from Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If distributed proceeds from debt refinancing and real estate sales in excess of Regency's carrying value of its investment results in a negative investment balance for a partnership, it is recorded within Accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n- The net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is accreted to earnings and recorded in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from 10 to 40 years.\n- o Those partnerships in which Regency has a controlling financial interest are consolidated. Additionally, those partnerships for which the Partners only have protective rights are considered VIEs under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation . Regency is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as Regency has power over these partnerships, and they operate primarily for the benefit of Regency. As such, Regency consolidates these entities. The limited partners' ownership interest and share of net income is recorded as noncontrolling interest.",

The major classes of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling equity interests held by the Company's consolidated VIEs, exclusive of the Operating Partnership, are as follows:\n\n| (in thousands)                                           | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Assets                                                   |                     |                     |\n| Net real estate investments                              | $ 107,725           | 379,075             |\n| Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash              | 2,420               | 5,202               |\n| Liabilities                                              |                     |                     |\n| Notes payable                                            | 4,188               | 5,000               |\n| Equity                                                   |                     |                     |\n| Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships | 24,364              | 27,950              |\n\n## Noncontrolling Interests\n\n## Noncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the common stockholders of the Parent Company: (i) the limited Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership held by third parties (\"Exchangeable operating partnership units\") and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (\"Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships\"). The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity. The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company.\n\nLimited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are not redeemable by the holders. The Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements. Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.\n\n## Noncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests. Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, the Company generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the other members' interest or sell its own interest in these consolidated partnerships. The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital. The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in Net income and Comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income of the Operating Partnership.\n\n## Leasing Income and Tenant Receivables\n\nThe Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent, with stated increases over the term of the lease. Some of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume (\"percentage rent\"), which are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of actual real estate taxes and insurance and common area maintenance (\"CAM\") costs (collectively \"Recoverable Costs\") incurred.",

        "page_content": "## REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\nLease terms generally range from three to seven years for tenant space under 10,000 square feet (\"Shop Space\") and in excess of five years for spaces greater than 10,000 square feet (\"Anchor Space\"). Many leases also provide tenants the option to extend their lease beyond the initial term of the lease. If a tenant does not exercise its option or otherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains an obligation for the tenant to relinquish its space, allowing it to be leased to a new tenant. This generally involves some level of cost to prepare the space for re-leasing, which is capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the life of the subsequent lease or the life of the improvement.\n\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"Topic 842\"), as follows:\n\n## Classification\n\nUnder Topic 842, new leases or modifications thereto must be evaluated against specific classification criteria, which, based on the customary terms of the Company's leases, are classified as operating leases. However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases) may be classified as direct financing or sales type leases, which may result in selling profit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition. At December 31, 2022, all of the Company's leases were classified as operating leases.\n\n## Recognition and Presentation\n\nLease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable. CAM is considered a non-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842. However, as the timing and pattern of providing the CAM service to the tenant is the same as the timing and pattern of the tenant's use of the underlying lease asset, the Company elected, as part of an available practical expedient, to combine CAM with the remaining lease components, along with tenant's reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, and recognize them together as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Collectibility\n\nAt lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility of substantially all payments due under the lease is probable due to the Company's credit checks on tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis. For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized straight-line rent receivables are reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection. Should collectibility of Lease income become probable again, through evaluation of qualitative and quantitative measures on a tenant by tenant basis, accrual basis accounting resumes and all commencement-to-date straight-line rent is recognized in that period.\n\nIn addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company may also recognize a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company's historical collection experience. The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, recoveries from tenants, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms. Uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\n\nThe following table represents the components of Tenant and other receivables, net of amounts considered uncollectible, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n|                                         | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (in thousands)                          | 2022           | 2021           |\n| Tenant receivables                      | $ 31,486       | 27,354         |\n| Straight-line rent receivables          | 128,214        | 103,942        |\n| Other receivables (1)                   | 29,163         | 21,795         |\n| Total tenant and other receivables, net | $ 188,863      | 153,091        |",

Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property. While generally rare, any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value at that time.\n\n## Management Services and Other Property Income\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\") , when or as control of the promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The following is a description of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606.\n\n## Property and Asset Management Services\n\nThe Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partnerships, which are generally perpetual in nature and cancellable through unanimous partner approval, absent an event of default. Under these agreements, the Company is to provide asset and property management and leasing services for the joint ventures' shopping centers. The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized over the monthly or quarterly periods as services are rendered. Property management and asset management services represent a series of distinct daily services. Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as service is rendered each day and the variability associated with that compensation is resolved each day. Amounts due from the partnerships for such services are paid during the month following the monthly or quarterly service periods.\n\nSeveral of the Company's partnership agreements provide for incentive payments, generally referred to as \"promotes\" or \"earnouts,\" to Regency for appreciation in property values in Regency's capacity as manager. The terms of these promotes are based on appreciation in real estate value over designated time intervals or upon designated events. The Company evaluates its expected promote payout at each reporting period, which generally does not result in revenue recognition until the measurement period has completed, when the amount can be reasonably determined and the amount is not probable of significant reversal.\n\n## Leasing Services\n\nLeasing service fees are based on a percentage of the total rent due under the lease. The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of an acceptable tenant lease for the joint ventures' shopping centers, at which time revenue is recognized. Payment of the first half of the fee is generally due upon lease execution and the second half is generally due upon tenant opening or rent payments commencing.\n\n## Transaction Services\n\nThe Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with each joint venture, which include acquisition fees, disposition fees, and financing service fees. Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which is the point in time when the Company recognizes the related fee revenue. Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Other Property Income\n\nOther property income includes parking fee and other incidental income from the properties and is generally recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met.",

These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term. If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of Lease income. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.\n\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately 15 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term subject to a maximum of 10 years for tenant improvements, and three to seven years for furniture and equipment.",

        "page_content": "## REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n## Development and Redevelopment Costs\n\nLand, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost. All specifically identifiable costs related to development and redevelopment activities are capitalized into Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are included in Construction in progress within the above table. The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development or redevelopment of the property, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development or redevelopment.\n\nPre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition or pursuing a redevelopment including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing or redeveloping a shopping center. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had nonrefundable deposits and other pre-development costs of approximately $6.9 million and $10.8 million, respectively. If the Company determines that the development or redevelopment of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately $588,000, $1.5 million, and $10.5 million, respectively, in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nInterest costs are capitalized into each development and redevelopment project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development or redevelopment costs expended. The Company discontinues interest and real estate tax capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after substantial completion of the building shell. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company capitalized interest of $4.2 million, $4.2 million, and $4.4 million, respectively, on our development and redevelopment projects.\n\nWe have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program. All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development and redevelopment project. The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we capitalized $10.8 million, $11.3 million, and $10.2 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development and redevelopment program.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the relative fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. The acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions and therefore transaction costs are capitalized. Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nThe Company's methodology includes estimating an \"as-if vacant\" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements. In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of inplace leases.\n\nThe value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed leaseup period. The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.\n\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable. The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable. If tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings.",

Properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Valuation of Real Estate Investments\n\nThe Company evaluates whether there are any events or changes in circumstances, including property operating performance, and general market conditions, or changes in expected hold periods, that indicate the carrying value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. For those properties with such events or changes, management evaluates recoverability of the property's carrying amount. Through the evaluation, the current carrying value of the asset is compared to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. Estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results. Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance. To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. If such indicators are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value. If a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.\n\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cash flow approach uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow approach above, as well as a discount rate. Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimate of fair value. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.\n\nA loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs. If management identifies events or circumstances that indicate that the value of the Company's investment in real estate partnerships may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by calculating the estimated fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment.\n\n## Tax Basis\n\nThe net book basis of the Company's real estate assets exceeds the net tax basis by approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, primarily due to the tax free merger with Equity One and inheriting lower carryover tax basis.\n\n## (d) Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nAny instruments which have an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.",

        "page_content": "## (e) Other Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration from the Equity One merger in 2017 over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , and allocates its goodwill to its reporting units, which have been determined to be at the individual property level. The Company performs an impairment evaluation of its goodwill at least annually, in November of each year, or more frequently as triggers occur. See note 5.\n\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If a qualitative approach indicates it is more likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative approach for any reporting unit, the Company will perform the quantitative approach described below.\n\nThe quantitative approach consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted projected future cash flows and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.\n\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized through earnings in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income and presented within Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## (f) Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nDeferred leasing costs consist of costs associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration. If the lease is terminated early, the remaining leasing costs are written off.\n\nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company, as a lessor, may only defer as initial direct costs the incremental costs of a tenant's operating lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. These costs generally consist of third party broker payments. Non-contingent internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities are expensed within General and administrative expenses.\n\n## REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDecember 31, 2022",

Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.\n\nAll derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges generally involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company may also utilize cash flow hedges to lock U.S. Treasury rates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in AOCI are amortized through earnings over the underlying term of the hedged transaction. The cash receipts or payments related to interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nIn assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\n\n## (h) Income Taxes\n\nThe Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income. All wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be a TRS or qualify as a REIT. The TRS's are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns. As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership generally does not pay taxes, but its taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately 99.6% owner, is allocated its Pro-rata share of tax attributes.",

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies and recent and projected results of operations in order to make that determination.\n\nIn addition, tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (2018 and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\n\n## (i) Lease Obligations\n\nThe Company has certain properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties, which are all classified as operating leases. Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties. The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business. Leasehold improvements are capitalized as tenant improvements, included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n\nUnder Topic 842, the Company recognizes Lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground and office leases and corresponding Right of use assets related to these same ground and office leases which are classified as operating leases. A key input in estimating the Lease liabilities and resulting Right of use assets is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rates implicit in the lease contracts are not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground leases, including market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and a securitization adjustment necessary to reflect the collateralized payment terms present in the lease. This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease to measure the operating lease liabilities.\n\nThe ground and office lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods. For ground leases, the Company generally assumes it will exercise options through the latest option date of that shopping center's anchor tenant lease.\n\n## (j) Earnings per Share and Unit\n\nBasic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive. Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.",

The Company recognizes the cost of stockbased compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, which is expensed over the vesting period.\n\nWhen the Parent Company issues common stock as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Operating Partnership. The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the sharebased awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the \"Plan\"). Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives. As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership records the effect of stock-based compensation for awards of equity in the Parent Company.\n\n## (l) Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or partnership interests. The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives. The proceeds from sales are generally reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions, new developments, or redevelopment of existing centers, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns. It is management's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the Company may decide to sell all or a portion of a development upon completion. The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio. The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.\n\nThe Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States. Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital. The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties. The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance.\n\n## (m) Business Concentration\n\nGrocer anchor tenants represent approximately 20% of Pro-rata annual base rent. No single tenant accounts for 5% or more of revenue and none of the shopping centers are located outside the United States.\n\n## (n) Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n\n- x Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n- x Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- x Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\n\nThe Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs.",

The remaining notes payable float with LIBOR or SOFR and had a weighted average variable interest rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2022. As notes payable mature, they will be repaid from proceeds from new borrowings and/or partner capital contributions. Refinancing debt at maturity in the current interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense in future periods if rates remain elevated. The Company is obligated to contribute its Pro-rata share to fund maturities if the loans are not refinanced, and it has the capacity to do so from existing cash balances, availability on its line of credit, and operating cash flows. The Company believes that its partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. In the event that a coinvestment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, the Company would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call which would be secured by the partner's membership interest.\n\n## Management fee income\n\nIn addition to earning our Pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees as discussed in Note 1, as follows:\n\n|                                                                                       | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                                                                        | 2022                      | 2021                      |                           | 2020                      |\n| Asset management, property management, leasing, and investment and financing services | $ 25,851                  | 40,301                    | (1)                       | 26,618                    |\n\n## 5.

A decision to sell a reporting unit results in the need to evaluate its goodwill for recoverability and may result in impairment. Additionally, other changes impacting a reporting unit may be considered a triggering event. If events occur that trigger an impairment evaluation at multiple reporting units, a goodwill impairment may be significant.\n\n## 6.

The Company's Lease income is comprised of both fixed and variable income. Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent, and in some cases stated amounts for CAM, real estate taxes, and insurance (\"Recoverable Costs\"). Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis.\n\nVariable lease income includes the following two main items in the lease contracts:\n\n- (i) Recoveries from tenants represents the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of Recoverable Costs incurred. Generally the Company's leases provide for the tenants to reimburse the Company based on the tenants' share of the actual costs incurred in proportion to the tenants' share of leased space in the property.\n\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income based on the criteria specified in Topic 842:\n\n| (in thousands)                                                       | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Operating lease income                                               |                     |                     |                     |\n| Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income                            | $ 851,409           | 797,502             | 807,603             |\n| Variable lease income                                                | 287,149             | 262,619             | 247,384             |\n| Other lease related income, net:                                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Above/below market rent and tenant rent inducement amortization, net | 22,543              | 24,539              | 42,219              |\n| Uncollectible straight-line rent (1)                                 | 12,510              | 5,227               | (34,673)            |\n| Uncollectible amounts billable in lease income (1)                   | 13,841              | 23,481              | (82,367)            |\n| Total lease income                                                   | $ 1,187,452         | 1,113,368           | 980,166             |\n\nFuture minimum rents under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding variable lease payments, are as follows:\n\n## (in thousands)\n\n| For the year ended December 31,   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2023                              | 850,211             |\n| 2024                              | 768,797             |\n| 2025                              | 657,870             |\n| 2026                              | 552,735             |\n| 2027                              | 440,844             |\n| Thereafter                        | 1,579,740           |\n| Total                             | 4,850,197           |\n\n## REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDecember 31, 2022",

Mortgage loans may be repaid before maturity, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums, and are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest or interest only. Unsecured public debt may be repaid before maturity subject to accrued and unpaid interest through the proposed redemption date and a make-whole premium. Interest on unsecured public and private debt is payable semi-annually.\n\nThe Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants for its unsecured public debt as defined in the indenture agreements such as the following ratios: Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Income for Debt Service to Consolidated Debt Service, and Unencumbered Consolidated Assets to Unsecured Consolidated Debt. As of December 31, 2022, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for its unsecured public debt.",

At December 31, 2022, the Line had a borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion, which is reduced by the balance of outstanding borrowings and commitments from issued letters of credit. The Line bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.865% and is subject to a commitment fee of 0.15%, both of which are based on the Company's corporate credit rating. On January 12, 2023, the Line was amended to convert the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a 0.10% market adjustment, with no changes in the applicable margin.\n\nThe Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the Line credit agreement, such as Ratio of Indebtedness to Total Asset Value (\"TAV\"), Ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value, Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges, Ratio of Secured Indebtedness to TAV, Ratio of Unencumbered Net Operating Income to Unsecured Interest Expense, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing.

The Company currently intends to repay three of the maturing balances, leaving the properties unencumbered, with plans to refinance the two remaining. The Company has sufficient capacity on its Line to repay the maturing debt, if necessary.\n\n## 10. Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors, and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions. The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative transactions or purposes other than mitigation of interest rate risk. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with quality credit ratings. The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.",

To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\n\nThe following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n| (in thousands)                         |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        | Fair Value at December 31, Assets (Liabilities) (1)   | Fair Value at December 31, Assets (Liabilities) (1)   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Effective Date                         | Maturity Date                          | Notional Amount                        | Bank Pays Variable Rate of             | Regency Pays Fixed Rate of             | 2022                                                  | 2021                                                  |\n| 4/7/16                                 | 4/1/23                                 | $ 18,637                               | LIBOR                                  | 1.303% $                               | 152                                                   | (175)                                                 |\n| 12/1/16                                | 11/1/23                                | 31,131                                 | SOFR                                   | 1.490%                                 | 883                                                   | (412)                                                 |\n| 9/17/19                                | 3/17/25                                | 24,000                                 | SOFR                                   | 1.443%                                 | 1,443                                                 | (364)                                                 |\n| 6/2/17                                 | 6/2/27                                 | 35,446                                 | SOFR                                   | 2.261%                                 | 2,158                                                 | (1,907)                                               |\n| 12/20/19 (2)                           | 12/19/26                               | 24,365                                 | LIBOR                                  | 1.750%                                 | 1,939                                                 | -                                                     |\n| Total derivative financial instruments | Total derivative financial instruments | Total derivative financial instruments | Total derivative financial instruments | Total derivative financial instruments | $ 6,575                                               | (2,858)                                               |\n\nThese derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.

Fair Value Measurements\n\n## (a) Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nAll financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, reasonably approximates their fair values, except for the following:\n\n|                        | December 31,    | December 31,   | December 31,    | December 31,   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n|                        | 2022            | 2022           | 2021            | 2021           |\n| (in thousands)         | Carrying Amount | Fair Value     | Carrying Amount | Fair Value     |\n| Financial liabilities: |                 |                |                 |                |\n| Notes payable          | $ 3,726,754     | 3,333,378      | $ 3,718,944     | 4,103,533      |\n\nThe above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs. Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis. As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.\n\n## (b) Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n\n## Securities\n\nThe Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the securities was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the value of securities are recorded within Net investment loss (income) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, and includes unrealized losses of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and unrealized gains of $1.7 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities consist of investments in certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using either recent trade prices for the identical debt instrument or comparable instruments by issuers of similar industry sector, issuer rating, and size, to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. Unrealized gains or losses on these debt securities are recognized through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.",

The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps. As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n\n|                                    | Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2022   | Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2022                | Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2022   | Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| (in thousands)                     | Balance                                           | Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)     | Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)         |\n| Assets:                            |                                                   |                                                                |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Securities                         | $ 40,089                                          | 40,089                                                         | -

The Plan allows the Company to issue up to 5.0 million shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options. As of December 31, 2022, there were 4.1 million shares available for grant under the Plan.\n\n## Restricted Stock Awards\n\nThe Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention. The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company. The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards. All awards are valued at fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights. Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards. Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period. Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index. Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation. Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award.",

Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters, and is subject to other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any particular lawsuit or dispute cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, the Company's currently pending litigation and disputes are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Environmental\n\nThe Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations pertaining primarily to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning tenants, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, older underground petroleum storage tanks and other historic land use. The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations. The Company can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to its shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contaminants; that its estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to the Company; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; and that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company.\n\n## Letters of Credit\n\nThe Company has the right to issue letters of credit under the Line up to an amount not to exceed $50.0 million, which reduces the credit availability under the Line. These letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral on behalf of its captive insurance program and to facilitate the construction of development projects. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $9.4 million in letters of credit outstanding.",

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Controls and Procedures (Regency Centers Corporation)\n\n## Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Parent Company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Parent Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Parent Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Parent Company in the reports it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Parent Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , the Parent Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\n\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \" of this Report, on the effectiveness of the Parent Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Parent Company's system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Changes in Internal Controls\n\nThere have been no changes in the Parent Company's internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n## Controls and Procedures (Regency Centers, L.P.)\n\n## Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Operating Partnership's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, the Operating Partnership conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'could,' 'should,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'believe,' 'intend,' 'forecast,' 'anticipate,' 'guidance,' and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law.",
